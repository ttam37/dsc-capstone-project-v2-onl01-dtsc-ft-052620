I bought it to get the colored cards that were in this set because that's what my daughter wanted for her kids and no other set had them. I put the colored cards in the classic Sorry game set I'm giving my grandson for his birthday. I knew when I bought it that there were only three pawns of each color...I'm giving the pawns to her to use as spares (you know how little things get lost when you have kids! LOL!). I'm not a fan of the tri-fold gameboard, but this gameboard did lie flat without a gap, even though it was thinner that other Sorry gameboards. The pawns are sturdy and in opaque bright colors and the game cards were a trifle thinner than other Sorry game cards but sturdy enough for the usual playing of the game.

It is now only 3 pawns instead of 4, you can leave Home on any movement card (instead of 1 or 2) and the Sorry! card allows you to move 4 as an option to swapping places with another player. We fortunately had an extra set of 4-each pawns from a discarded copy of the game.  There is still the original count of 45 cards; you can just play with classic rules for the cards. Honestly, the components are good quality. If you buy this version, at least round up an extra pawn for each color, and it can be played OK. (Or don't buy it at all!)\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I wanted to get this game for my kids because they had been playing around with a McDonald\\'s Happy Meal version for a while, but that version was problematic and mostly garbage (except for the dice popper).  I saw that there was a \\'Retro\\' edition which I remember as the design from my childhood, but it was a lot more expensive than I thought the game should be. I saw that Hasbro had updated the game  and it was really inexpensive. Since this was going to be a bit of an introduction to board games for my kids I didn\\'t want to spend a ton.That should have been my first clue - that the \"retro\" one was almost 3x the price. The product that arrived is so flimsy and cheap on so many levels. The box it comes in is a thin card stock that barely holds its shape. The game board: there are two components that you need put together yourself for some reason. The plastic part is very thin and very wobbly. The card stock insert (which is the same thickness as the box, by the way) is flimsy. Even the playing pieces feel cheap; There\\'s no weight to them at all. They don\\'t stay on the pegs all that well (the original had holes for the pieces to stand in). I can already see that playing this is going to be a bit of a hassle all around. I know that kids get excited and will end up bumping the table or the board, and the pegs are going to go flying off their location because they have no weight to them nor anything to really hold them to their places. The original board and its pieces were very hefty and an incredible quality when compared to this updated version.The only positives I can give this version is the addition to some variant rules, which will come in handy when the kids want a change, and the dice popper functions rather well. I think I might spring for that \"Retro\" version after all.\\n\\n',\n",

This game is great because you can learn the rules in a few minutes and the set up is a cinch. Just put your colored pegs in the correct color coded slots and you are ready for the best part of the game- the popper. I used to love the satisfying click of pushing it and seeing the dice tumble. Getting that number you need is a tiny thrill or getting to send an opponent back is worth a laugh or two.  I love this old fashioned game and appreciate that we can still buy it. It will hold up well for a whole new generation to play and love. This would be a great game to take along on camping trips if the kids get bored or need some down time.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  This is an updated version of the classic game Trouble. It has some extra gimicks to it, but the game play is essentially the same as always. I loved the game as a kid and was excited that my oldest was ready to play it too.However, Hasbro has really cheaped out in how they're producing the board to the point of making it almost disposable. The game consists of a plastic board with a paper overlay (yes, paper not even card stock) for the board which the pegs fit through. The paper board overlay is, well, thin paper. Mine came already ripped/crumpled in one corner, so was returned. The board is fairly thin plastic, though the pop-o-matic bubble seems to be of reasonable quality (actually hard for a little kid to press). However, since the pieces sit on top of pegs (instead of in cups as in older releases), any time the board is bumped or jostled the pieces are likely to fall out.So still a good game... but if you can find the older boards, it's probably a better bet to go for one of them. I'm planning on buying one of those (still available on Amazon) to replace mine.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  There are a lot of bad reviews for this version of Trouble because of the board quality/design.  A lot of complaints especially regarding how the paper-thin board graphic sits on top of the thin plastic base. It\\'s important to note that there are two small plastic lips on opposite sides of the plastic board that should hold the graphic in place.  Once I \"installed\" the graphic correctly, we never had issues with it coming off and messing up the board.  It\\'s still fairly easy to knock off the pieces if kids aren\\'t careful, but I see it as a good hand/eye coordination lesson.  I was a bit disappointed with the quality, but had no issues with it once the game got underway.  It\\'s just going to get trashed anyway, especially with young kids.  If they get older and still love the game, spring for a more expensive one, but I assure you, my kids weren\\'t complaining of a cheap game.  They were too busy having fun.  If I had to change one thing, it would be the box the game is stored in.  If that were a little thicker, it would be better.  I don\\'t see it lasting very long and then I\\'ll have to figure out where to keep the board and pieces.  It\\'s about the same thickness as a cereal box.\\n\\n',\n",

You do so by pushing down the pop-o-matic dice. It can sometimes be difficult for kids to roll the dice, as the pop up thing tends to get stuck. The quality is okay. It's not the greatest but for the price I can't complain. The top part of the game is a flimsy paper that comes right off the board.

From the box, to the packaging, to the game itself -- this did not carry the same quality as other games I own from Hasbro, Milton-Bradley, Parker Brothers, etc.Don't know if this was due to Hasbro or to Amazon fulfillment but it did not come in the condition it was promised.

The plus is that the game board comes with the classic, built-in, pop-o-matic die roller.  The minuses are that the board has a lot of give to it and could probably be bent without much effort.  The board also comes blank and is made of solid black plastic (the classic game is made of clear plastic with the colored game board attached underneath).  This version includes a flimsy cardstock template that you have to place over the top of the board.  There is virtually nothing to hold the template on so I am going to have to glue it in place since it will be subjected to a classroom full of young children with autism who will tear it apart at the first opportunity.  I will go ahead and bring it to class but I'm also headed straight to eBay to see if I can buy a Trouble game from a few years back that is of higher quality.  Poor job Hasbro!\\n\\n\",\n",

The bins for the pegs are skimpy, making it easy for pegs to fall out, and the case doesn\\'t close fully when all of the pegs are in the bins. I\\'m keeping the white pegs in plastic zip-locks and dividing the red ones between the red and white bins. All of the pegs come in one plastic bag, and the instructions say to divide each color evenly between the 2 cases. Seems like they could easily have put half of each color in a separate bag. BTW, handling the small pegs is not meant for people with arthritis in their hands. The ships are meant to be stored in another side section, but it\\'s difficult to get them in place and they easily fall out of their \"berths.\" As others have said, it\\'s difficult to see the letters and numbers identifying the rows and columns of the grid - a contrasting color to the background would have been great. If I had it to do over, I\\'d teach the grandkids to play the game with paper and pencil - easier, more fun (more ships, easily identified by the first letter of their names), and of course much less expensive.\\n\\n',\n",

I fixed that with a strip of masking tape and wrote them on it in permanent marker. These adjustments took only a few minutes. In the end, it\\'s a fun game. The pegs are sturdy and there are certainly plenty of them and they store inside the case along with the ships. We actually just finished playing a few rounds with the kids and when we were finished it was as simple as shutting the cases and putting them in the box. When you first get the game and open it, you will find inside the box the two cases, instructions for playing the game, a sticker sheet that has two \"Battleship\" stickers to put on the cases, a plastic grid that has the total of 10 ships (5 for each player) that you simply twist to take apart from the grid and a bag that contains all of the red and white pegs. You will need to split the pegs evenly between the two cases. After these initial steps you\\'re ready to just open the cases to play and shut them to put them away.

If you have little patience, find a different game. If you only have one kid of battleship playing age think about what you're doing to yourself. If you have multiple kids of battleship playing age know that they will fight, cheat, tattle, lose pegs and never put it away correctly... Perhaps all that is what leads to the fond memories.

All in all, we enjoyed this game and are glad we added it to the collection. I hope Disney continues making new board games for each ride like they have with this one and Jungle Cruise! We’ve loved them. No creepy themes to be found here. Family friendly 100%.Gameplay - By taking 3 actions per turn and doing some simple strategizing, players travel throughout the Haunted Mansion encountering happy haunts and adding ghost cards to their collections. Different ghost cards score different points, and most require collecting the same cards in sets to maximize points. But beware! The hitchhiking ghosts move about the small board each turn, forcing you to draw haunt cards, which can cost you dearly at the end of the game.This game is very easy to learn and set up, and has some fun basic strategy to it that kids will grasp and adults will find entertaining. There is a fair bit of opportunity to directly hamper opponents and even steal their cards, so be prepared for some inevitable conflict depending on your group!Materials - The board is the highlight, featuring great illustrations and a fun rotating “endless hallway” in the center of the board. Plastic figures were good quality, and even the box had fun stretching room illustrations. I felt the cards were a little flimsy and not on par with Villainous or Jungle Cruise however.Final Thoughts - this is a great addition to the collections of Disney fans, those with kids, or anyone looking for a thematic, light, And quick game of what feels like simplified Splendor with some action economy mixed in.\\n\\n',\n",

I can see adult Disney fans and gamers playing this on a Friday night over a bottle of wine (like me), and also totally believe the box when it says 9+.The gameplay is simple: You take three actions on your turn (essentially move and collect ghost cards) and you are trying to collect sets of matching cards to get the most points at the end. There are even handy player cards that have the actions spelled out so you never need to reference the rulebook. Speaking of the rulebook, they were smart enough to partner with Geek and Sundry to have an extremely well-done how to play video with the link address right in the directions if you don't feel like reading.Replayability: Tons. Each round is made different by having event cards that change some of the rules for that turn, so although you may have a plan on how to grab the ghost cards you want, there will always be a little twist you'll have to look out for. Also, there are the Hitchhiking Ghosts (with a STUNNING model) that move around the board, and you get penalties if they cross your path. BEWARE THE HITCHHIKING GHOSTS, hahaComponents: Wow. Just wow. The art is INCREDIBLE!!!!!! Every single piece of art is stunningly crafted and each ghost card and the board art is instantly recognizable from the ride. Seriously, look at some of the pics I attached.In summary: This game is a MUST BUY! With the holidays coming up, I know what I will be getting all of my Disney buddies!!!\\n\\n\",\n",

Doesn't affect game-play, but is pretty pathetic considering the price.  Also, the company is so interested in cutting corners now that the plastic tokens aren't two sided... so gone are the good old days when after a Sequence, you flip the 5 tokens over to freeze those chips.  Quality goes down, company profits go up.  Well... review ratings can also go down guys.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  We love to play games as a family.  There are four of us that usually play: my husband and I, our 9 year old daughter, and my 83 year old mom. We enjoy playing both board and card games and Sequence is a great combination of both!The game itself is really simple to learn and played in up to three teams. When the four of us splay, we find it simplest to play two teams of two.  The game indicates that it's for ages 10 and up, but my 9 year old had no trouble mastering it, although she sometimes doesn't always pay attention enough to the strategy aspect.  My 83 year old mother also has trouble with strategy sometimes!I like that a game usually goes quite quickly (less than one hour).  This is definitely a new favorite for us and I highly recommend it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  This is an easy to learn game that has a different game play every time!  It's a bit of bingo and poker combined.  You can have 2-3 teams of single players or multiple players.  The object of the game is to create a 5 card sequence much like bingo.  Players put down a card and add a chip to one of the 2 locations of that card on the board.  Although the goal is to create a 5 card sequence, players can strategically place chips to block the others.  The twists are the one-eye jacks (can remove a chip from your opponent's growing sequence) and the two-eye jacks (wild card that allows you to place your chip anywhere on the board).  My 13 and 10 year-olds really enjoy the game.  It captured their attention for 3 - 4 rounds in one sitting.  As compared to the multi-page instructions of the Euro-games, this game is more approachable both in terms of complexity and set-up.  In addition, its affordable cost is excellent for multi-generational families.  An 8 year old child will have as much fun as an an 80 year old great grandmother!\\n\\n\",\n",

We learn more about strategy and about each other's competitiveness. LOL. On the surface the game is pretty straightforward. The goal is to develop two Sequences of five chips each. The first player or team to do this wins the game. This is easier said than done. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a deck of 52. The board contains a thumbnail image for each card in the deck. Once the game starts the first player lays down a card and places a chip on the board representing the card he or she has just laid down. Then he or she picks up a new card from the deck and then the next player takes a turn. There are a few little twists and turns in this game that pump up the fun, like the one-eyed and two-eyed Jacks. Those guys are powerful! Fun for the whole family.\\n\\n\",\n",

I have had the exact set before but I took it to a friends place once and it never came back! They loved it...so much for the game itself.I ordered it again in December 2018 but was disappointed to see that quality of the materials used has deteriorated considerably. The chips are lighter, cheaper plastic, the fold-able board seems fragile, the card deck is very very light - almost feels a tad thicker than printer paper. Instructions now printed on what seems like recycled paper (I don't mind that, but worth noting). Yes, I did get it for a bargain at $12. However, now it makes sense why the price was low. Too bad that they made it look like an offer price. Honestly I would not mind paying $20 for a better quality version. Should have tried the Tin case version, but who knows if they are any different.If anyone is reading for what the game is like - CLASSIC. Just buy this, easy to learn and a lot of fun to play!\\n\\n\",\n",

We had lots of fun playing this with teams of larger groups and with just two people. I would say 5 and up for the age range. Adults had lots of fun too.We marked or put stickers on the back sides of the chips. That way when someone got a sequence we flipped the chips over so show they couldn't be removed anymore.\\n\\n\",\n",

There is some strategy to the game if you want to win, but the element of chance plays a huge role in this game. There are very few rules and the game easy to learn; easy to play.To clarify, the game comes with only 3 different colors of tokens. Many people can play at the same time, but no more than 3 teams. So you can play with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12 players (any number divisible by 2 or 3). Of course, with too many players, each one will hold very few cards, limiting his options. We've had the most fun with 3 or 4 players. Still hoping to try 6.\\n\\n\",\n",

We have over 40 board games in our game closet, and this one is in the top 10% of group games we like to play. You can play it with only 2 people and it\\'s still fun, but we prefer to play it with 4 or 6 people. When family members come over and I suggest various other board games to play, they frequently say \"We want to play Sequence instead!\" It\\'s an easy game to learn, and involves strategy (but not to the level of something like Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, The Palace of Mad King Ludwig, or Agricola). Game play is made more difficult because you can\\'t \"talk across the table\" to your team member(s) to strategize, but that just adds to the overall fun!!! By the way, you\\'ll want to price compare for this game. Historically, Amazon has been the cheapest place to buy it. I bought Sequence on Amazon a year and a half ago and paid $13.99. It\\'s now down to $9.97 on Amazon. During the Christmas holidays, Walmart was selling Sequence for like $17 or $18! It\\'s gone down now - but my point is to shop around for the current prices! :) Anyways, I highly recommend this board game - it\\'ll be a family favorite in your household!!\\n\\n',\n",

Each person keeps the same amount of cards in their hands while discarding cards that have a matching card space open on the board - placing a chip there.  Once you get 5 chips in a row you win - with two people only you have to get two rows of 5.  When playing with two people only one side of the chips are supposed to be painted to signify the first row of 5 chips achieved....  these chips were NOT painted on one side.  A permanent marker solved the issue easily but should have arrived as needed - loss of a star rating.  Board is small compared to size of delux sized board, but regular game comes with cardboard style board and Delux comes with cloth style board for easy travel.\\n\\n',\n",

It was a several months later that we discovered the defect, so we did not return it.  Now we use dimes for the red chips since we have been unable to buy suitable replacements.\\n\\n',\n",

This makes it very frustrating and nearly impossible to play if you don't have great eyesight. We tossed the useless chips and kept the chips from an old game.

Okay for less savvy kids, but use green and black chips.  Rules state red chips are used only when 3 players or teams.  Less chips are needed for 3 so maker produced less red chips!

I used to play with her too when I was younger and I wanted to find her something new that I thought she might enjoy. I played with her and other family members on Christmas and everyone who played enjoyed it. It is also very easy to understand which made it easier to explain to every new person wanting to play. Many friends told me they were going to look it up when they go home and I ended up buying one for myself as well\\n\\n',\n",

Boo!  This takes away the fun!  Hasbro, get real - I'd rather pay an extra dollar for the game and get a working spinner.  This should be obvious!2) The came only comes with FOUR cars, and not in such great colors.  The Game of Life used to come with SIX cars, so not only could more people play, but even if only a few were playing, you had more colors to choose from.3) WHERE ARE THE BUILDINGS???  And the hill?????  They were so much fun, but Hasbro took them away.  Boo!4) This is subjective, but for ME, I prefer the action cards that *I* land on be for *me*.  I like the old life tiles, where the person who picks it up did something great and gets money, or did something awful and has to pay.  Now you get an action card and you pick someone else and have a spin-off, and sometimes they get paid from my action card.  That's no fun!  I think it's more fun when each person gets their own action cards that relate to them alone.  Like I said, this one is subjective.5) This one is also subjective, but the game was too short.

       "  '\\n\\n  Great update to the original.  The action cards have an extra little activity that you get to do. For example one card you visit the Great Barrier Reef and you have to describe a sea monster that you saw. Another card you show your skate boarding moves. The pets are fun. They did away the 3D pieces that would always pop out and make the board bulky except for the spinner.Cons: Still has the same spinner that rarely work right. Box has a  4\" hole where the spinner sticks out. You have to make sure all pieces are bagged so you don\\'t loose them. The flow of money is ridiculous. I don\\'t expect it to be realistic but maybe not so outrageous. You get paid 30k to go on a ski trip and you have to pay 10k when your pet eats your homework.All and all it is a great family game. We have have 2 boys 9 & 11 and they both had a great time.\\n\\n',\n",

But that\\'s where the kudos end. They have found numberous ways to convelut the game. There are too many types of cards, adding confusing spaces on the board. I\\'m guessing this was an attempt to \"spice things up\". But it falls flat. Also, it\\'s harder for younder kids and newbies to pick up. The biggest, and I mean biggest disappointment however is the spinner wheel. This was the funnest and defining attribute of the original game. In this version the spinner is uber cheap and very difficult to get a good spin. Anyone from the 80\\'s remembers you could spin the wheel and it would go on for a long time. This one falls apart, and is near impossible to get a full spin. Granted the price is cheap, but I\\'d rather double the price, and get a quality game that could be passed down. Not a thrift store version of the original. Very dissatisfied.\\n\\n',\n",

Easy assembly since you don't have to place all of the buildings on before you play. I wish they would add $20,000 dollar bills back to the game again.

Clue was one of my favorite games growing up, period(I even had a computer game version) I actually still have my old game (which I\\'m comparing to) but is missing the weapons an out of the clue sheets to track your clues so I figure what they hay and purchased this version.Boards are petty much the same, the rooms are the same, they have the same secret passages, only main difference is the new version is much brighter.Another difference you\\'ll note is Mrs. White is no more, if I have to guess I might suggest her name was the reason for that...they now have Ochid.The rooms and weapons are the same. The character pieces are nooo fun. The pieces from the old game actually look like people, we use to fight over them as kids based on who they are, now I feel like they would just request their favorite color. Super lame. The character pieces is apparently a pretty big deal to me because for some reason this really upsets me that they are now just basic pawns.Obviously the cards are updated. More modern. They no longer have a yellow confidential envelope but instead a place one with a simple question mark on it.Game play has changed some as there are now \"magnifying glass\" option on the dice. If you roll them you get to pull a hint card. I hate change so I\\'m not a fan of it but I guess to stay relevant they do want to make some changes.All in all, clue is still a great game, this is a fully functional game, none of the pieces were missing, it was delivered on time, undamaged and unopened, price was fabulous, definitely a good game to play for older children or nerds on game night but I do prefer the old one to the new  everyone should own the game clue or play it in their life.\\n\\n',\n",

My issue with this is that when you open the board and lay it flat on the table, the crevices that are cut stick up from the table, making the board not been properly laid on the table. The cards it self-are very thin and cheap. The corners started to peel just after shuffling them a couple of times. I paid $11 here, but at the store, they have them for almost $20, not worth that price. Everything else in the game was good, I just wasn't too happy with the quality of the material.\\n\\n\",\n",

This one is just like when I was young, except it has added some special cards that increased the fun,  Things that reveal an extra card now and then.  So we recommend this as a great family game with a long history of helping kids use deductive reasoning.That said,  we could not give this particular game 5 stars because 8 of our clue cards came with black ink smears that made them hard to read.

There is some strategy here in what you reveal to other players or what you don't reveal.  Careful note taking during the game is key.  I would like to see character miniatures instead of plain old pawns, but for $8 it's a steal.  I almost purchased the Star Wars version but seeing the play through on Dice Tower and reading how horribly broken that game is on Board Game Geek (although there is an interesting variant) I went with this version instead.\\n\\n\",\n",

I wanted a game my husband and I could play together, just the two of us in the evening, and I got “Dr. Lucky”, “Clue”, and “221B Baker Street”. 221B was the hands down winner and the only one we have played more than once.CLUE:Too easy, bored out of our gourd. There is no analysis, no player involvement. It’s simply a matter of deducing which cards are in the center of the board.I feel a little guilty about this rating, as I’m sure Clue is fun for children, and the more the merrier (it is essentially the interaction of the players and the beautiful graphics which creates these warm memories and not the challenges of the game itself). We only played the game once and gave it away to Good Will so children could enjoy itDr. Lucky:This review is on the card game not the board game. In spite of each having college degrees, we are not smart enough to play the Dr. Lucky card game. The written rules were very elusive: not what we were looking for. We want the game to be mysterious, not the rules. There is a lot of point taking, but what is the purpose since the winner is solely determined by whoever kills Dr. Lucky? So what difference does it make how many points you have? Fyi, Dr. Lucky is the only game we looked at in which the players determined the outcome of the game. The cards are beautiful and the writing clever.221B:Fabulous Game! Wonderful Sherlock Holmes ambiance and a classic feelI don’t know how anyone cannot enjoy this game, there is involvement, analysis, deduction, the moment the lightbulb goes off (the brain tease), player pay-off (or, as they say for books, the “reader pay-off”), and only 2 players can play it and have fun!So there you have it, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I debated whether to order this stripped-down, modernized version of the game or another, higher-end version of the game when I decided to get \"Clue\" for my kids.This set is okay, but because it\\'s so basic, it doesn\\'t \"set the mood\" for Clue nearly as much as some of the other versions do, and for that reason, it\\'s less fun. Everything is just a bit plain. The grids on the board are just white. The player pieces are just little plastic bits like you\\'d find in a Sorry set. And so on.This game also adds a new innovation (extra Clue cards that have instructions on them, like showing some of your clues to another player) that I\\'m not a fan of. They\\'re trying to make the game more \"hip\" or something—I can absolutely imagine a bunch of people in an office meeting room with the boss saying, \"Okay, let\\'s update all of our games to have a more \\'Cards against humanity\\' feel, since that\\'s what sells these days. For Clue, what should we add?\"Point being... I don\\'t like it. The point of Clue is to play with mystery and problem-solving and just a touch of murder Noir. It\\'s a mood game. It\\'s not a laugh-giggle-go-nuts-with-crazy-instructions party game. I pulled those cards out, I think they hurt the game rather than improve it.My advice—if you want to get Clue, spend another $10-$20 and get one of the better editions of the game with a nicer board and nicer pieces that can help to support the early century period, noir, semi-steampunk vibe of the game rather than making it feel so \\'ironic dime store hip,\" which in my opinion just doesn\\'t fit with the game\\'s overall theme.Also—since Amazon asked me to provide a \"Giftable\" rating for the game... I wouldn\\'t get this edition for a gift, either. It would look fairly chintzy. This edition feels like a sub-$10 board game, which it is.\\n\\n',\n",

The one and only reason that I have dinged my review to 4/5 stars is because of the quality of the actual board.  It is a bit thin and flimsy and the way it folds into quarters, I can tell it will wear down fast, unfortunately.  It is nowhere near as thick and sturdy as the typical boards of the boardgames that fold in half rather in quarters.  I get that the manufacturers are probably trying to make the boardgame more compact and easy to store in a smaller, square box rather than the typical bigger rectangular boxes, but I\\'d rather have the longevity of the better made boards over perhaps slightly better storage.  I\\'m already thinking that in the near future I\\'ll have to tape up this newer version flimsy board with clear packing tape when it starts falling apart.\\n\\n',\n",

She\\'s a bit ... competitive, however, so even playing a game like Settlers can put me on the edge of the seat a little bit if I\\'m winning. Some of you know what I\\'m talking about. Board games kept popping up in my Amazon recommendations, and I kept seeing this one (nice work, Amazon ad algorythms). Cooperative? Sounds good!There went that Sunday. I even stopped watching football, BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE DYING IN ISTANBUL OR CONSTANTINOPLE. We played several games. We lost our first few, then kept winning. Our kids were annoying us with petty stuff like, \"Daddy, I\\'m hungry\" and \"Mommy, my toe fell off\" but sometimes you just have to tell your kids that now isn\\'t a good time, because Daddy is building a research center and then has to fly to meet Mommy in Milan, and there is leftover ham in the refrigerator.I do question whether the game will keep its challenge. We\\'ve won our only two games on the hardest difficulty, but it felt suspenseful and like we could have lost, so I think it\\'ll still be fun to play. Regardless, we\\'ve already gotten our money\\'s worth out of this game.

       "  '\\n\\n  It seemed like we’d just started the game and the yellow strain had not only been cured but eradicated!  We were on the cusp of a cure for the second strain.  This one was in the bag.  We had weathered two epidemics so far without any egregious problems.  Sure there was a pair of cities in Eastern Europe that was in danger, but what were the odds that was going to be a problem?  One of us was already there.  Then another epidemic hit, the infection rate increased, three cities were drawn and it seemed the cascading outbreaks knew no bounds.  I think nearly everyone in Europe died that day, and we – a group of specialized scientists- were served a plate of bitter defeat.  Again!  Again and again, always defeat.  Oh, the humanity!It’s true, I haven’t ever beat this rotten game and yet I keep coming back.  Because one day I’ll win;  in spite of all the wounds to my pride I’ve had to nurse, one day I’ll – I mean- we’ll win.  I say we’ll because this is a co-operative game where you all work together against those nasty strains of no-doubt-human engineered beasties.  Now, I know there are those of you who beat this every time you play, like I beat Shadows over Camelot every time I play, but I’ve invited those sorts to come play with me and they can barely stand the shame of losing with me.To make it even worse, we only play with 4 epidemics.  I feel like I’m at an AA meeting:  “Hi my name is Kyle.”“Hi Kyle” echoes the crowd.“I… I suck at Pandemic.”This is the part where you put your arm on my shoulder and tell me it’s going to be alright.Game PlayThis board is a handsome map of the world; only instead of country boards you see in Risk there is a red web of interconnected cities.  Everyone starts in Atlanta were a research station is and you go from there.  Each player plays a scientist that has a special ability: one can move others on their turn, one can give cards to another without the restrictions other players have and so on.  The game also begins with 9 random cities around the world with varying degrees of infection (one to three stacked blocks).  If a city would have a fourth block put on it (called an outbreak), it actually stays at three and the cities connected by the red web get a block.  Isn’t that nice?  It’s called a cascading outbreak.  Such a pretty name.  If you get 9 outbreaks in a game you lose.  If you run out of blocks for a certain strain you lose, and if you haven’t cured all the strains before your white deck of cards runs out, you lose.  I hate to be a negative Nancy, but there’s a lot of ways to lose this game.  If, on the other hand, you are able to find cures for each strain, you win!How do you do that? Well you get someone who has got 5 cards of the same color in their hand to a research station, that’s how.  One of the players only needs four.Every turn each player gets to do four actions.  Picking up a cube off a city counts as one, so does moving between cities.  You can charter flights with your cards, rather than use them for cures.  You can build research stations and fly between those without expending a card, and a few other things.  Then you draw cards that you think will help you, but can instead turn out to be epidemics.  And you also draw cards for cities that get infected: usually this amounts to adding on square to the city’s pile.  As the game progresses, more cards are drawn at a time to be infected.  Oh, and when an epidemic happens, the cards for the cities that were infected get put back on the top of the draw pile.  Oh dear.I hate to tell you what to do because what do I know anyway?Those of you who beat this all the time should tell me what to do.  I understand that finding the cures is everything- lest you run out of time.  Others say, make sure that you never have three on on e city at a time, as to avoid outbreaks.Make sure that the medic is only clearing off stacks of infections, the dispatcher should be moving people so that don’t have to move themselves.Again, I never win, so what do I know?ThemeIf it hasn’t been obvious, I am completely sucked in by the theme.  There are similarities to other co-operative games especially Forbidden Island:  Each character has special powers, you make moves for the team and then the board pushed you closer to defeat, that sort of thing.  Forbidden Island also shares the shuffle the cards and put them back on top of the draw deck mechanic.  I tell you this so that you won’t be surprised if you decide to add them both to your game closet, this is why I haven’t added Forbidden Island to mine, though I’ve played the game.  While this adds to the evidence that the theme could be stripped out of the game, I don’t recall cascading flooding going on in Forbidden Island, or feeling like humanity is hanging in the balance, or being glad I don’t live anywhere in Eastern Europe.  That is to say, I think the theme sticks.BalanceI read about people who win all the time and needed the expansion to rouse any concern in them.  But who can believe everything they read on the internet, I ask you?  Just because I’ve never won though doesn’t mean that it’s not an enjoyable experience, mind you.  Because I keep coming back.InteractionInteraction is very high.  There’s all sort of collaborative discussion that goes on through this game.Learning CurveLow.  It takes all of ten minutes to explain and there are directions on the board and the turn cards.DowntimeNill.  You are all in it together!  And you even get to move a guy in your turn.What’s not to Like?I actually know where some of these cities are on the map are but they all have these lines that go from the pin-pointed location to the circle where you actually place the blocks.  That remains a bit annoying even after playing the game 10 times.Collateral EndorsementMy four year old likes “The one where they get sick”  We run around curing cities till the infection deck runs out.  He feels a lot better about himself than the rage I feel playing by the real rules.Actually, as I think about it, the first time I played this game I was at the home of some friends and I think we won.  But I’m certain I have not won with my copy of the game.  I’d say mine is jinxed, but we’ve played on another friends copy and lost there too.  Also, I should say that a brother of mine lost two in a row and saw the writing on the wall in the third game and left the table, swearing off the game forever.

Some of our favorites: Settlers of Catan, Fluxx, Munchkin, Phase 10, Parcheesi, Sushi Go!, some of the Cheap-Ass games, just to give you an idea.We like having a variety of types of play to switch things up & keep us interested, but once in a while a game is simply addictive & we can play it over & over for hours.  Settlers is like that for us (even after many years).  And now Pandemic is, too.  We just can't stop playing!It's definitely challenging.  One of the great features is that you can increase the difficulty level once you start feeling like the game has become easy.  But don't judge that too fast, either.  There are so many factors that add variety to the game from play to play.  For example, the random assignment of a Role for each player means that your characters' combination of special abilities are different each game, so you need to adjust your strategy to take the best advantage of them.One reason I chose this is because feedback about playing with two players was positive.  Most of our games require at least the 3 of us to be any fun.  And pretty soon my son will be moving out, so we'll need some good two player games.  This weekend we got to test it with 2 people, and it was absolutely just as fun as with 3.  In fact, it surprised us because it required such a different strategy than with the 3 of us.  And once we adjusted and began winning at the lowest difficulty, we tried the next level and found we had to shift gears again. (And wow that level is tough)This is the first cooperative game we've owned, and we love that about it.  None of us is particularly competitive, so we find this a really nice change from the usual.  Maybe if we can stop playing this incessantly, we'll simply use it as a nice break between other games in a sitting.\\n\\n\",\n",

There are multiple roles you and your team mates can play, each with unique powers that allow you to work around the rules in a specific way.Pros:There is a high sense of urgency and tension in the game.  Working against the game to win in time really draws you into the theme.The cooperative aspect of this game is great if you\\'re not in the mood to play against your friends and family.

If everyone just does their own thing, you will lose for sure.  The rules even encourage discussion before making any actions.It really does an excellent job of making the game a challenging opponent.  The game\\'s \"AI\", that is, the way you draw cards and spread the diseases through \"outbreaks\" means that the game is very difficult without requiring a player to make decisions.Cons:The game can be very hard, even on the easiest setting.

Having a great cooperative game in your rotation is a good way to get people who don\\'t like the competition aspect of games to be able to enjoy themselves too.The game itself is fairly easy to get the hang of after a few turns and allows for great strategy sessions where you work together to eradicate the various diseases on the board to trigger the win condition.

It\\'s that enjoyable.  This one tends to be a favorite in our board gaming group, and we keep bringing it out time and again.The only issue that I have with the game set is that the instructions aren\\'t the easiest to read if you want a quick summary of win conditions and such.

And, if you win, it\\'s a strong sense of accomplishment; if you lose, you can always try again!To the game itself:  We love the quality of the pieces (sturdy plastic for the disease cubes and game pawns, well-made cards that have withstood numerous plays and shuffles, and a very sleek game board and box!), but we especially love that it\\'s a different game every time.  Each of you randomly selects your role, giving each of you a special ability that can help your team.  You then randomly place disease cubes on the board, and then start trying to find cures.  Sometimes, you get lucky, and you can discover cures quickly, but, other times, epidemic cards come up so quickly that you don\\'t know what hit your team!  Admittedly, the first few plays are slow, because there are a lot of rules to keep track of.  But, after a few plays, you really get the hang of it, and, since you are working together, you can help each other learn the game.  We\\'ve found that a typical game takes around 30-45 minutes, which is a good length of time.Finally, I\\'ll say that one other thing we really like about this game is you can adjust the difficulty:  make it easier by putting in less epidemic cards or laying your hands on the table so everyone can see, or make it harder by adding in more epidemic cards and/or playing with expansion packs.  Some other rule changes to make the game more challenging are included in the main rules.The few complaints we have had about the game are that the game is only for 2-4 players (more requires an expansion pack), so, if your family or board game group is large, keep this in mind.  Also, although the game is cooperative, it is hard!  We\\'re currently on a streak where we haven\\'t won a game in weeks, but I\\'m hoping we\\'ll save humanity soon enough!Anyway, if you\\'ve been growing sick (he he he) of the \"standard\" board games, give this one a try.  It was our first venture outside of \"standard\" board games, and Pandemic is why we now own Ticket to Ride and Forbidden Island, and are looking at Settlers of Catan.  This coming from people who started out with Monopoly, Clue, and Life!\\n\\n',\n",

This had been recommended to me by Amazon for literal years, but I had always hesitated.It went on a good black friday sale price, and I pulled the trigger because so many people in public forums have compared other games back to this.  I wish I would have done it sooner.Our first game was our longest, as we followed the included rule book carefully and in a procedural manner.  I\\'m told this is an improved version of the original, but I will say I wish the rulebook was more explicit to what causes an \"outbreak\" but we were able to figure it out by playing.  A simple line I wish was stated specifically:Outbreaks:  These occur if any city that already has 3 infection markers on it gets another infection marker.  Follow the outbreak rules section when this happens.Once we had a grasp of the rules, my group (all adults in our 30\\'s) VERY quickly got into the strategy of the game, and the discussions of what to do next was exciting and rapid.  We loved being on the same side for once, working against the deck.  Our first game we won almost easily, the second we made harder with 5 epidemic cards instead of 4, and despite some solid effort, we lost!  I like this that way, if we could easily win every time we would get bored quickly.  The loss left us wanting to go again, but we were out of time.First game took us about an hour and 15, but our second game was much much faster.  Probably closer to 40 minutes.The overall rules are simple enough that I would say kids can definitely grasp it after a few play thru\\'s.  This game has been very addicting for us, we may clear our schedules of other games for a while.  It\\'s also expandable from official sources, which I\\'ll be looking into, and if you are good at game design you could add a few things yourself without breaking it.\\n\\n',\n",

The more people you have playing it can be a really long game. Although it's co-op you don't have to share your cards with everybody and let them know what you have. Before you start the game, you may want to make it clear to everybody else that the game consists of teamwork, but nobody is leader. I know there can be some forceful personalities; it sucks the fun out of the game when people are telling you what to do, and you feel like it's not even really your turn, but their turn nonstop with your character.There's three ways to die, so that makes it fun! You're in a hurry to figure out how to survive. Some rules are unclear and confusing. Look online, and there's a lot of people there to clarify the rules. The first time I played it was with two friends. We misunderstood a lot of the rules and went all over the place, and even changed rules in the middle of turns, to try to sort it out better. It wasn't a proper game at all, but it was loads of fun, and we won right before there were no cards left to draw. My friends also have this obsession with the asian character guy, so they always hope and pray they get him when we mystery pull character roles. And no, they've never pulled him. I did once.

It’s a strategy game, which means you have to be on top of it, and my guess is it’s one of those games that you’ll get better at if you play it several times or even on the regular. I don’t do anything regularly (except maybe work and exercise and cook) so it’s hard to get good at something/anything if you only do it every few weeks. But here we are in an actual pandemic and so I thought it might be fun and relevant to play a board game called pandemic. And funny thing, amazon was only delivering essentials and this came right along with my bulk lentils and rice and well in advance of my TP & PT. So we decided to tell the kids that it was government issued by trump and that moving onto the next grade depended on whether they beat it, and they didn’t beat it and then the kids stressed out and I am a tiny bit concerned that could be considered psychological abuse given the circumstances. I think they’re over it, or maybe not, since according to their Dad one of them was obsessing over an assignment on his iPad outside in the rain during a nature walk. Homeschooling is strange. So are daytime pajamas & Zoom dress codes. My honey and I are about 2 for 3 in our winning of this game, so maybe we will get one of those $1.2M stimulus checks that some folks are getting if they had an AGI over $1M last year.

I was trying to  introduce my family to some new board games in an effort to get the kids to spend less time on video games.  Pandemic was a hit with my daughter, my 9 year-old son, and myself (unfortunately, my wife refuses to play those \"weird games\").I can\\'t add much more than others have already said.  However, since my family was new to cooperative games and this style of game expected that we might have problems understanding the rules which might cause short-attention-span kids to quickly lose interest.  To alleviate that I purchased the iPad version and played a few times myself prior to gifting Pandemic to my daughter.  It ended up being a great decision on my part and we were able to start paling relatively quickly.  I mentioned, we all enjoyed it and my daughter prefers it to \"Forbidden Island\" and \"Ticket to Ride.\"  I enjoy all three, and my 10 year-old son prefers cooperative games such as this.The only downside is that the \"cooperative\" component sometimes turns into an \"argumentative\" component when there\\'s more than one strong-willed player who thinks their strategy is the best.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Pandemic is legendary. It\\'s tense, but it\\'s a lot of fun. This is a great game for 2 to 4 players, but you can also play it solo by controlling more than one of the character roles.Your mission is to cure epidemic breakouts of four different types of disease before they spread out of control. You work together with other types of medical professionals to travel the world learning how to treat and ultimately cure the diseases.Pandemic is one of my favorite \"gateway\" games. A gateway game moves a non-gamer toward becoming a gamer. Or introduces someone who has only played mass market games like Monopoly or Clue to the world of games that are actually good. Pandemic is also a good introduction to cooperative gaming, where all the players work together as a team to beat the game rather than competitively trying to beat each other.This has become my wife\\'s favorite game. She loves it because it is challenging but not impossible to beat, it is quick and easy to set up and put away, and 2-player games last anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes. Whenever we pull it out (which is frequently) we normally play it two or three times.Pandemic has inspired many other similar games, but it remains a classic. Highly recommended.\\n\\n',\n",

I got this to play with my girlfriend, and we\\'ve played with our families and some friends as well. It is very easy to teach since you\\'re all on the same team, so you can show people how to play as you play. It also lets you choose how difficult you want it to be by letting you decide how many Epidemic cards you add to the player deck. When these are drawn, they will make you infect more cities each turn and they will cause all the cities you have already infected to be shuffled and placed back on top, so they will keep getting more disease added to them. The more Epidemic cards there are, the harder the game gets because this happens more often.It requires a lot of foresight and strategy if you want to win, as you always have to be aware of what cities are potentially going to be drawn, and if you get close to the end you need to remember that there are only a set number of turns. Each player has a different ability that they can use, so we have found that it can be easier to play with more people, as this gives you access to more abilities. However, in the games I have played, we have both won and lost with 2, 3, and 4 people playing. It can certainly be tough depending on the game.And that\\'s why I\\'m rating it 4 stars. I really like the game, and, as a side note, the physical game itself is outstanding. The box is very sturdy with spaces inside for all the pieces and cards. The cards are sturdy and the player pieces and \"disease cubes\" are all beautiful (everyone comments on how nice the components are). However, the game play can vary greatly. Sometimes you\\'ll win easily, sometimes you\\'ll win at the last second, sometimes you\\'ll get crushed early, sometimes you\\'ll lose just when you think you\\'ve won it. This can be a good and bad thing. I like that there\\'s no way to \"figure it out\" and win every time, but it would be nice if it wasn\\'t as random. (I suppose you could decide where to put the Epidemic cards in the deck, but we haven\\'t tried that.) I played with my brother once and we won very easily, and now he\\'s convinced that it is too trivial.All in all, I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging co-op game.\\n\\n',\n",

We've only played a dozen or so times, losing more than half of those, but we don't feel discouraged in another go at curing diseases.Having said that, although I still consider myself an amateur at this game, I feel too much success/failure depends on which characters you draw. Some amazing combinations can be made with whichever ones are drawn, but some are definitely better than others, and too much time can be spent deciding on how to coordinate each move rather than simply enjoying the game... that's likely due to those playing overthinking everything though.Either way, I highly recommend this game, even to newbies like myself!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  When I first saw this game I had never actually heard of cooperative games. I read a bit about the concept and I thought to myself that it all seemed a bit pointless – playing games is about winning and how do you win if you don’t have someone to beat? I know that solo games such as solitaire are geared towards beating the system, but to me that’s because you don’t have a human to go up against (and ideally mash). I’m sure I’m not the only one whose family background was board games when it rains, with a win at all costs attitude instilled at an early age – it’s just what you did!But then I thought about it. I love my wife so why do I always want to pulp her when we bring out the old favourites? I thought to myself that it might be a better idea if we face things together, a kind of extension on how couples are supposed to be. So I bought Pandemic as a Christmas present for her (me!), not knowing very much about it at all or if we would enjoy it. But hey, need to shop for present: box ticked!We took our time learning the rules, but they aren’t too hard to grasp and we played a few easier levels and then dived into the toughest one. When we lost there was no finger pointing and when (if!) we won it was a very affirming experience for us as a team. I really have to recommend this game; it’s given me a taste for an unexpected evolution in game development and now I’m looking at other things out there too.But we still play the old stuff like Ludo and Risk, and she still hammers me in chess…\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Okay, to start out, I love love LOVE Pandemic!  I admit it, I\\'m a bit competitive.  I hate losing games.  I\\'m generally fine with competitive games where the best strategist (or luckiest) wins, but I really dislike games (like Settlers of Catan) where some players can gang up on others.  You pretty much don\\'t have a chance when every other player is specifically playing against YOU.  Pandemic is fantastic because you cooperative with the other players and you all win or lose together.  I just absolutely love sitting at the table talking about all our options and strategizing together.My son introduced me to Pandemic several months ago, and I was hooked.  We\\'ve spent several afternoons/evenings playing again--and again--and again.  On many occasions when I am home alone, I play all by myself (playing two roles), and we\\'ve also played four players on several occasions.With two players and four epidemics, we win every time.  With five epidemics, we win about 70% of the time.  We\\'ve tried six epidemics a couple times, but have not been able to beat that game yet.  Still trying!  Ugh!  As you increase the number of players, the game gets more difficult.  With four players we\\'ve only played with four epidemics, and we win probably a little over half the time.  I honestly think it would be impossible with four players and six epidemics, but someone has probably proven me wrong.We\\'ve even discovered another way to lose the game, which is not listed in the rule book!  It says you can lose by having too many outbreaks, running out of disease cubes, or running out of player cards.  We\\'ve lost in all those lovely ways.  However, a couple of times, we\\'ve had only a few outbreaks, had plenty of cubes of each color left, and plenty of player cards.  Three diseases cured, with only one to go.  One of those times, we\\'d even gotten through all the epidemics, so there were none left in the infection deck!  We\\'ve got it made, right?  Uh, no.  Turns out we discarded too many of the same color city cards, and there were only four left total, including in our hands and in the player deck.  Neither of us was the Scientist, so that was an automatic loss.  This is a danger when you get dealt a nice hand at the beginning, say two or even three of the same color.  You decide to collect those, so when you discard, you are discarding the other colors.  If you happen to keep drawing you \"discard\" color and it takes too long to collect the color(s) you want, you\\'ve now discarded too many of the other color and you don\\'t have enough left at the end to cure the disease.  Beware.We have also managed to lose the game on the very first turn.  We were very unlucky drawing the infection cards when setting up the game:  three on Karachi and Delhi, and two on Kolkata.  Our first player did not have any way to get to that location to do even a little treating, and the first card drawn from the player deck was an epidemic.  After resolving the epidemic, the first card drawn was Delhi, which caused a double outbreak (Delhi/Karachi) and put the third cube on Kolkata.  The second card drawn was Kolkata, which was a triple outbreak (Kolkata/Delhi/Karachi) and lost us the game as there weren\\'t enough disease cubes.  Yep, lost on the very first player card drawn and there was not a single thing we could do about it.One slight change we sometimes make in the game is to draw 10 cards at the beginning instead of 9.  The first nine infect the cities, and the tenth is where we place our player pawns and the first research station.  It adds a level of difficulty to the game to not always start in Atlanta.  We were noticing before that we always seemed to get in trouble with black and red, and we believe it was because all our players started so close to blue and yellow so those cities were easy to get to and treat.  Now that we can start anywhere on the board, blue and yellow have become equal opportunity killers.There are a few things it is easy to get wrong.  When the infection rate moves up, it\\'s easy to forget to start drawing three cards (or four) since you\\'re so accustomed to the lower number.  It\\'s also easy to forget to discard, not noticing that you have more than 7 cards in your hand.  One scenario we\\'ve encountered a few times involves having 8 cards for literally a second.  You meet another player on top of a research station, and share knowledge by pulling that city card from her.  You now have 8 cards in your hand, but 5 of one color.  Your very next action is going to be curing a disease, which will leave you with only 3 cards.  But, before you cure that disease, you have 8 cards, so we think you have to discard one even though literally on your next action you will be discarding 5 cards.  This is a little frustrating, but the rules specifically say that if you EVER (my emphasis) have more than 7 cards in your hand, you must discard (or play an event card).We were also a little confused by the role of the Researcher the first time we played.  To be clear, when the Researcher shares knowledge, she and the other player must be on the same city, and the card can only go FROM the Researcher TO the other player (on either player\\'s turn, as an action).  She cannot take a card from the other player (and they cannot give one to her), unless it matches the city they are sitting on.It is also extremely easy to forget to infect cities after resolving an epidemic.  You\\'ve spent a bunch of time resolving, then strategizing based on where the board stands now, and you completely forget that you still have to infect before going to the next player.Lastly, you are not supposed to choose your roles.  We played with one person who had played before, and he said they always choose which roles they want.  I suppose you can play that way if you want, but the game would be far less interesting because people would probably tend to choose the same roles every time.  The instructions say to shuffle the role cards and deal them to each player -- that means they\\'re supposed to be random.  It\\'s far more interesting and challenging when the roles change every time.  A good part of the strategy is figuring out how to maximize the advantages that each role gives you in any given game.Pandemic is basically figuring out exactly how much effort you have to spend in each game sharing knowledge in order to cure diseases versus preventing outbreaks, all while maximizing the strategic use of whatever role you are playing.  Spend too much time on one, and the other will get you.  Sometimes you just have to say \"oh well\" and let an outbreak happen, even when you could have prevented it.  It may just be more important to get to that one city in order to share knowledge than to get to the city where the outbreak is about to happen in order to prevent it.  However we do try hard to prevent double outbreaks because things can get very bad very quickly when that happens.Okay I\\'ve rambled enough.  If you\\'re on the edge, buy this game!  It\\'s awesome.  Every game is different and it never gets boring.  It is equally fun with two or more players, although the more players, the more challenging it is.  You can control the difficulty level by player with fewer or more epidemic cards.  A+\\n\\n',\n",

There is a lot going on in the game. It seemed a bit confusing a first. Once I got into the swing of things, it was not so bad.I like how you can get different roles each time one plays the game. It makes it more interesting. It has different challenge levels too. This is a fun game with two players. I think 3-4 players make it more challenging as well. Since it is a co-op game, an extra player hand can be made if there is only 2 players.The thing I do not like is that it took me a while to get used to the game. There is a lot going on. It makes sense why there are reference cards to give to the players. I got used to it after the second game. The other thing is to win the game is to cure all the diseases. I think it would be more fun to be able to eradicate all the diseases. It would also make the playtime longer though if that was the case. The other thing is I do not like how one of the ways to lose is when the entire player deck is gone. It feels like it shortens the playtime a bit, especially if I am into the game and want to continue playing to see if I can cure everything before I get to many outbreaks, which is another way to end the game,\\n\\n',\n",

For the dedicated tabletop player, or the family looking to play infrequently, this is a must buy game!\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  My boyfriend and I just can't play competitive games against each other. They always end with one of us gloating and the other glowering, muttering profanities under their breath. So, we decided that we'd try to find a good cooperative game. Unfortunately, good two-player coop games are tough to come by.That's why we're so happy to have found Pandemic. It's you against the board WITH your partner (up to four people). The game is really easy to catch on to; after playing through the first few moves, we both got the hang of it. You definitely don't need to be a hugely experienced boardgame player to enjoy it.There are tons of small parts and nuances to each game, so I do recommend limiting the game to 10 years old and up. Expect your first game to last 90 minutes with the learning curve, but that time will quickly reduce to an hour or so after you understand how to play the game. Set up takes five minutes.Overall, the game is replayable and thoroughly enjoyable. My boyfriend and I are both not super great at it (yet), but I would much rather be conquering this game WITH him than tearfully conceding another game TO him. At least, now, I have a chance.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nDiseases, Infections & Outbreaks...Oh My!!!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n  \\xa0If anyone has read my reviews and/or answers on questions you will see that in the past year my family has gotten really into the Ticket To Ride (TTR) games.  Well, while purchasing one of my latest TTR expansions I stumbled upon the Pandemic games; which are similar to the TTR ones in that you start with a base game, get the foundation for rules and game play and then you start moving on to expansions with additional features.  I purchased Pandemic and with Amazon Prime it was delivered in less than 24 hours, no kidding!  As is my usual custom I read the instruction manual and then because I am a visual learner I went to You Tube to watch some videos.  ZManGamesOfficial does a 9.5 minute brief tutorial.  WatchItPlayed does a wonderful job walking you through the game prep for a 2-player game including where all pieces, cards, etc. go.  This was very helpful as there are specific instructions on how to shuffle and stack the Player Cards.  My niece and I had this video up while setting up the first game.  Finally, I watched Geek & Sundry do their TableTop version of the game where you actually get to see the players play.  They have an abbreviated video and then a 1.5 hour extended game play.  So, these are just tips that helped us get an understanding of the game play and we had a blast!Pandemic allows you to travel from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and you travel throughout the world trying to cure and eradicate 4 diseases.  The instructions make it sound so easy but oh boy; it is not.  Game play can be learned in about 15-30 minutes.  The difficult part and it is not the actual game-play; is trying to come up with enough strategies fast enough to cure and eradicate the diseases before you and your team die!  Yes, team...unlike TTR this is not a game 1 player wins.  It\\'s a collaborative game in which all players work together...you discuss how you can unite forces, share your special roles, your cards, etc.  But be careful of an alpha player who may start bossing people around, telling them what to do and takes charge of the game. If you get an alpha player just let them have the game board, pawns, etc. and tell them to play the game by them self but as if they were many players.  In the end if it\\'s your turn you can listen to others, even the alpha player, but what you do is totally up to you.  If you don\\'t have a good strategy everyone loses...my niece and I call it dying because we have succumbed to the disease.So, why is it a race against the clock?  Well, no matter how well your strategy, your team can \"die\" IF you: Have 8 outbreaks before curing/eradicating all 4 diseases, you run out of Disease Cubes or Player Cards. Note: You don\\'t have to eradicate all 4 diseases to win; you just have to cure all 4. First game we cured all 4 diseases and eradicated the yellow (\"Crazy Banana Disease\") but we got 8 outbreaks...we saved the world!  2nd game; yes, we played another because we were feeling lucky!  We cured all 4 diseases, didn\\'t eradicate any and once again we saved the world.  We named our diseases the Black Zombie Plague, Purple People Eater (Blue cubes), Angry Bird Virus (red) and of course the Crazy Banana Disease (yellow) because my niece named it while infecting Miami.During your turn you can play up to 4 actions, draw 2 Player Cards but you cannot be holding more than 7 at any given time and then you MUST infect cities!  The Infection Rate starts at 2 cities per player, per turn.  But every time a player draws an Epidemic Card they have to move the Infection Rate marker and it slowly increases the Infection Rate from 2 cities up to 4 cities.  The Epidemic card also requires you to draw 1 city from the bottom of the Infection cards and you must infect that city with 3 disease cubes; 1 more cube of the same color and you have an outbreak, oh my!  Finally, the Epidemic Card requires you to \"intensify\" the Infection Cards. That means you must shuffle all the Infection Cards (cities) that have been played since the last epidemic, including the city card you just drew from the Infection Card pile and then put them back on top of the Infection Card pile so they now go back into play.  See the intensity?  With just my niece and me playing we didn\\'t have as many cards to reshuffle so we kept infecting the same cities; which in essence was then producing outbreaks faster.  I \"think\" you may have a longer game play with more people because then the other players will also be contributing cards.An outbreak occurs if/when a city accumulates 4 of the same color disease cubes. When this happens you must put a disease cube of that same color in every city that is directly attached to the city that the outbreak occurred in, thus, the epidemic.  Note: It\\'s possible that you have infected a city with more than 1 disease so IF you have 4 or more disease cubes but they are different colors you do NOT have an outbreak.  The outbreak is only when you get 4 of the same color in the same city but the 4th cube (same color) will not be placed on the city.  So watch those disease cubes and treat and cure so you can prevent the outbreaks.Now when you play up to 4 actions during each turn you have an option to treat a disease.  You treat by removing 1 or more disease cubes from the city you are in (each cube being an action) that you have used your actions and/or role to get to.  I was the Medic during first game and one of my roles allowed me to remove ALL disease cubes from the city I was in or traveled to!  The Dispatcher can move players from city to city with their permission so once again...If you have a Dispatcher in the same game with a Medic you can move the Medic to the city that needs to be treated and get rid of all the disease cubes.  IF the disease has been cured (see above pic...the disease markers are solid colors and moved above the disease logos) then you get to remove ALL the disease cubes in that city EVEN IF you aren\\'t the Medic.  To eradicate the disease you must remove ALL disease cubes of the same color from every city on the board.  When you have eradicated the disease you flip the disease marker over to reveal the little log for eradicated.  Note: Cities can still be infected if the disease has been cured but NOT if it has been eradicated.Back to the outbreaks.  There\\'s also an outbreak chart with marker and each time an outbreak occurs you have to move the marker.  If you have 8 outbreaks the game is over and there is no winner because everyone has died.  You also have Research Stations and these are nice because there is one action that allows you to shuttle from station to station and that can get you closer to an infested area to have a chance to treat, cure and/or eradicate several or all cities.  There are also Role Cards and pawns to match the color of your role.  Each role has special duties that only that player can perform (see above with Medic and Dispatcher).  You don\\'t get to choose your color/role.  Pandemic is for 2-4 players and there are 6 Role Cards so you won\\'t have all 6 roles in game play at the same time.  There is another extension that adds a 5th player.I know there is a lot more that can be said and I or someone else can try to answer your questions.  I just played for the first time last night (4/13/19) and while playing the 2nd game I came to Amazon and we read descriptions for some the expansions.  I immediately ordered Pandemic: The Cure--Experimental Meds and then about 2 hours later I ordered Pandemic: State Of Emergency (this introduces diseases/infections from animals). So as you can see this is how pleased I was with Pandemic and yes, we are still playing TTR...I will be posting some more reviews on those as well because I currently have 9 versions.I think I got infected with a board game virus but hey, what can I say; my family/friends still love games the old-fashioned way...totally unplugged, board games and card games around the table.  On a side note I must share what happened during our game.  My daddy called and my sister held the phone out so he could hear my niece and me playing.  We had one part of the map covered and ready to explode with black Disease Cubes.  My niece was trying to tell me how I could (as the Medic) take care of all the blacks.  She said, \"Auntie, if you just get rid of all the blacks we won\\'t die!  Can you just take care of all the blacks over there?\" and she pointed to the area that was well infected AND we were trying to treat/cure some the disease so that we could remove some the black Disease Cubes off the board and continue game play.  Later I dropped a Dorito on the map and I told my sister, \"Shay-Bo, I think I just killed everyone in Moscow because a large UFO has landed on them.\"  We are a Christian family that doesn\\'t drink, smoke, etc.  We just like to have good clean fun but I told my family if anyone was a fly on the wall during our game play they would have been questioning our integrity.  We have already planned our next family game day for Good Friday and yes, it will be good!!\\n\\n',\n",

It offers strategic depth, a bit of random chance, and a compelling narrative to follow. It's also well balanced -- you can win if you do things right, but you'll lose a lot figuring out how to do so. Highly recommended for anyone new to board games or curious about co-op games in general.Pandemic Legacy is also pretty cool, but I'd say this is the better starting point. If you're going into Legacy, it's better to understand the core fundamentals of how to win at Pandemic as losing in Legacy has repercussions that reverberate through future games.\\n\\n\",\n",

You spend about 45 min, but the game ends when you cure all the infections.  If you do manage to win, you still got a game board full of colors cubes.  I kind of wish the game came with more player cards to help the game go on longer and have the end be when you exterminated all infections vs just cure them.  Now this is a board game, so there nothing stopping you from just reshuffle the player deck and keep going until you clear the board.Over all it still a fun game and I highly recommend anyone to try it.  I find the game easier with 2 people and gets harder the more people you play with,  even wtih just 2 people the game is not easy.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  My boyfriend and I just started doing game nights and this has been a game changer (pun intended). He actually can\\'t wait for \"no netflix night\" and usually suggests we play this game.- It\\'s a great cooperative style game. This is awesome for really competitive people who might want to play it a little safer and not risk tensions running too high.- It takes a while to learn. Some of the rules are not as readily apparent from the rule book, and your first game might take a while understanding all of it. For instance, our first game we thought the objective was to eradicate, but it\\'s just to cure (multiple beers may have been involved tbh). Be patient and it\\'ll seem second-nature after 1-2 games.- Fun balance of strategy and luck. I\\'m not a big fan of pure luck games, mainly because I have none. Some people might like that thrill. But I do like strategizing and coming up with (diabolical) game plans. This is a nice bit of both.- It\\'s not easy to win. That\\'s part of what makes it so fun. It\\'s addicting because you might get so close, but come up short. Took us 5 games on the \"easy\" level to finally win.- Great for 2 or more people. We like games we can have fun with just the two of us (i.e. if you have no friends), or if you invite others. It\\'s also nice because the pace of game-play does allow outside conversation, so you can interact with your friends on a game night, not just immerse in the game and not talk for hours.\\n\\n',\n",

It is very important to read the rules thoroughly and take them at their face value. Don't read into them too much or you'll just confuse the intentions of the game. I've googled many rules when we were confused and found many online arguments over the rules that just led me back to taking the rules literally and just accepting that it means it literally. I think this last time we played we finally didn't accidentally cheat. We'll be upping the difficulty for next time!

The goal is really this - have one player get 5 card of the same color so you can then cure a disease.  Everything else plays in to that.  Get 5 of the same color, cure the disease, and you're on your way.  Use the player abilities.  They're really helpful.  Collaborate.  That's the fun of the game and what makes it unique.  I've played it 3-player and 4-player, with my kids (14 & 16) and with adults, and it's a lot of fun and a very unique premise for a board game - both in concept and that it's collaborative.Get the game, watch the videos, play the game with the directions/reference handy, and you'll be on your way in no time!\\n\\n\",\n",

It is super fun, challenging with a group - I like that its a group game where everyone works together and either wins together or (sadly) loses together. I think we needed to tweak rules a bit to win with 4 players (max) because it was extremely difficult otherwise but with 2 people it is challenging yet enjoyable and with experience, you will get the hang of it in no time! It may take a while to remember all the rules and nuances, but there are helpful cards that remind you of various rules, etc. so its easy to visually remember. Very happy with purchase. Came in great packaging and condition.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  This game is an absolute blast.  And it is reasonably easy to learn (now this is not Sorry or Chutes and Ladders, but for someone that plays role-playing games like D&D, Munchkin, Pathfinder, etc., this is fairly easy), and yet definitely takes some time to master strategy which leads to good replay value.  It is a great game for a 10 year old.  She learned about geography and maybe a bit about disease, certainly good for problem-solving skills.  We love that it is cooperative and we don't have to worry about hurt feelings (we can be a bit competitive with competitive games).  The quality of the board, cards and pieces is high.  There are a lot of small pieces (the disease cubes, about 7 x 7 x 7 mm) so be warned if you have a baby/toddler around (or a cat like ours that likes to jump on the board while we play), that this could be a definite choking/scattering/getting lost hazard.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who thinks an intelligent, cooperative board game would be fun.  And again, probably 10 years old plus and it is for 2-4 players.  It does seem a bit harder with 2 than 4 players to be honest.  Games take about 30-45 minutes and player number does not seem to affect that.  You do lose or fail to save the world sometimes, but difficulty seems very appropriate after playing 5 or 6 times.  You can adjust difficulty by putting in less epidemic cards (per rule book) or even tweakin rules a bit (allowing cards to be exchanged just by being in same city instead of same city and having card of the city) at first while you learn or with younger players.  We tried this game with a 7 and 8 year old and, at least for those two, I do think this game was a bit too advanced.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I love Euro-Style board games and I have been introducing my kids (6 and 8) to them over the past couple of years; however, there is always bickering and even tears as one child eventually gloats when he/she does something to hinder the other. So, after watching Wil Wheaton play Pandemic on an episode of Table Top, I thought this might be a good way to go, despite some trepidation I had about a cooperative game.  When I saw it for a good price at Amazon, I figured I had nothing to lose, and gave it a shot.Some key benefits about this game (especially when playing with kids) are as follows: The game is really easy to learn, it\\'s really fast to set up, and plays in less than an hour. The game mechanics are very interesting, too (for example, when the dreaded Epidemic card is drawn).  Plus, since it is cooperative, I don\\'t have to \"dummy down\" my strategy when playing with my kids.  Instead, we are all working together to devise the best strategy to use our limited resources on each turn. This is also a huge benefit when introducing someone new to Euro-Style games.  Another benefit (if you want to call it that), is that this game is terribly difficult to win. The board beats us much more often than we win, but since we are all losing together, we oddly have lots of fun doing so.My opinion of cooperative games has definitely changed. I\\'m not sure if any other ones would bring the same excitement as Pandemic, but I think a have many more hours of Pandemic to play through before I\\'m bored with this game. Also, even though I mentioned this game with regard to my kids, I play it often with other adults, and it\\'s always fun.\\n\\n',\n",

As a biologist, I also particularly enjoy that you have to try to develop cures for diseases before they go global. Probably one of the best aspects of this game, however, is that it is a COOPERATIVE game. So you aren't good at strategic games and/or don't like being put on the spot? No worries, it is a team effort so others can assist you in coming up with plans. Maybe you or some of your friends are super competitive and losing causes frustration beyond belief? No problem. Your friends cannot really get mad or upset because everyone will win or lose as a team. It is the perfect game and is slightly different every time you play it. Have fun!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Jaws of the Lion is a fantastic evolution of Gloomhaven\\'s setup. Gloomhaven is a great game and deserves its ranking, but its hard to teach (and play) and the setup takes a while to get going.  Jaws of the Lion shortcuts a lot of the setup and the starter senarios, the added text on cards, and the tips catapult this game up my personal play rankings.  If you were on the fence about spending the money on Gloomhaven this is the game to play first.  The rules and game play mechanics are unchanged and the game is far more \"coached\". This makes it easy to get the core gameplay down and that carries over very well to the original.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I hate reviews that are not about the overall experience of the product so I am sorry that I\\'m providing one now. However, I feel this is more beneficial (or in line with a product review) than those about the package being lost, damaged, or out of return policy since that doesn\\'t properly represent the product.ACTUAL PRODUCT PACKAGING REVIEW:I just received the game (about 30 minutes ago) and, although I\\'ll probably love the game, I\\'m a little disappointed with the packaging. At initial glance, I thought the box was damaged because it was bulging (i.e. one side about a 1/2 inch higher than the other when sealed). Upon opening the box, I saw that it was due to the box being poorly designed. It barely holds the game after all the items are punched out and stored \"properly\" in the box. I quoted \"properly\" because I still can\\'t figure out how to get everything to fit inside without the box bulging a little. As it stands and if using the original insert, it\\'s an extremely tight squeeze to the point I keep checking to make sure nothing is being bent. I wish the product/box designer would have given .25 to .50 inch more room for to allow a few more imperfect ways to repackage the game. That said (and even though I hate doing this), I may just remove the insert(s) to allow more ways to configure the game for repackaging purposes.\\n\\n',\n",

The best thing is for the setting via book style map, so we don’t need to waste time for setting up. In addition, the storage is improved comparing with Gloomhaven to provide a the token tray.

       "  '\\n\\n  Cepholofair games has produced a great standalone game that serves as an entry point to their more complex products.  The box is heavy and stuffed with content, and will keep gamers occupied for days.  Solo mode is no more complicated than having a single player control more than one character, and the experience is still enormous fun.The name \"Jaws of the Lion\" belongs to a group of mercenaries (the characters the players will control) in the settlement of Gloomhaven.  The game is structured on a continuing campaign played in individual scenarios with the feel of one of the old \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books.  Actions and decisions made by the players result in the opening of new quest lines and occasionally the closing of others.  After all, if you have the option of helping a shop owner or stealing from her and your first impulse is to steal, your future options will not include helping her as she no longer trusts you.  It should be stressed that this game is cooperative, and each player has a vested interest in teaming up with and enhancing the abilities of the characters of other players as well as their own.  One Leroy Jenkins can have a disastrous effect for the whole group.The mechanics of the game are introduced slowly using a few different booklets, allowing players to get basics cemented before introducing new concepts.  As the story advances and characters increase in power, new abilities are unlocked and new game features made available.  The scenarios are designed to highlight these new abilities and functions, letting players get more comfortable with the foundation of the game and understanding how the characters are intended to perform, making for more creative thinking and dynamic play.Dice are not a part of this game, instead assuming that an attack will have an effect but modified by numeric values or combat effects (eg: stunning, poison) that are determined by modifier decks associated with each character; monsters have their own deck.  Players eventually gain access to items that will increase their abilities and ways to increase their characters\\' lethality and effectiveness.  Many monsters have innate abilities that produce negative effects on characters, and there is a variance in how tough those opponents become based on the number of players and the power of the characters.  Each scenario is challenging, and may require more than a single effort to pass.Monsters are actually controlled by the players based on rules about the order in which they become active, what player character is targeted by attacks, and how the monsters will move.  This information is usable by the players and can become key strategic factors when moving, attacking, etc.  A weaker character may try to move later in the round than a monster that deals a great bit of damage so that a more robust character can soak up the attacks.  The character moves after those monsters attacks so she is safe, then attacks at the end of the round; on the next round, the character moves as early as possible to get out of the way before the powerful monster gets a chance to attack her back.The scenario booklet is well structured and contains the maps on which the game is played.  The rules being in a separate booklet means that the scenario describes details specific to the current adventure of the characters but there is no need to disturb the figures and terrain features to look up effects or resolve rules-based questions.  A well-designed breakup of function that makes learning the game and playing through the scenarios easier than a disruptive method that bundles everything into a single booklet.It is rare that I have encountered simplified versions of games that are effective at easing a person into a more complicated ruleset; the best example I can think of is the early \\'80s when Dungeons & Dragons was a streamlined entry point from which players would then graduate to the more detailed Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.  Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion has successfully become the most effective game I have seen for whetting the apetites of people who want to learn Gloomhaven but have been intimidated by the size and complexity of that system.The items and basic mechanisms of this game are reprints of components from the more complicated Gloomhaven game, and the characters - once developed to use standard cards roughly around level 5 - seem portable and compatible with the big brother game.  I am also tempted to go back and try a modified version of Jaws of the Lion using classes from the standard Gloomhaven game starting from level 1.If you or your group are into fantasy / roleplaying games but the cost of multiple rule books is daunting, or adventures are too easy or hard because encounters are not well scaled to your level, or play has become too formulaic, this is an easily affordable game with high replay value and excellent foundational systems for combat and character development.Buy this game, and add Gloomhaven to your wishlist.\\n\\n',\n",

He indicated that he was going to go ahead and ship those with the missing part I requested. As I had not been that deep into the game at that point, I hadn't noticed if I had misprinted pieces. I pulled them out to check and what do you know? He was right. I received the missing dial and new standees the next day in the mail. Talk about TOP NOTCH service! The miniatures are detailed and durable. All of the components are upper tier without a doubt! They went away from the dungeon tile route and now utilize a spiral notebook with pre drawn, hex mapping right in the book. quality is 10/10.The game; WOW! Talk about an immersive, narrative driven dungeon crawl experience. This is next level game play. The spiral book maps accomplish 2 things very well. 1: Set up time is diminished considerably as you do not have to search for the correct tile to lay for any given scenario, it already there. 2: Even better, the art! Oh, the ART! Because they went this way the art work is SPECIFIC for that exact scenario. If you are in a forest, there are fallen trees, in a cave, stalagmites, boulders etc. The generic tiles were...well, generic. They needed to be able to accommodate the 100 plus scenarios of the original GH so the art was same same pretty much throughout.Also, the way they implemented the training wheels on the front five scenarios is hopefully going to become and industry standard in gaming. Those of you even remotely interested in the hobby know that some of the games coming out these days can be extremely heavy and complex. To the point where it can be intimidating to get it to your table, let alone purchase. The way they did this really is one of the most innovative things I have seen in the industry, maybe ever. I have more creators pick this up and run with it. I believe that barrier of entry on many games that people are intimidated by can be broken by utilizing this method.The story is great, The gameplay, strategy, puzzle pieces of the game are EPIC. If you are even half way interested in the theme, D&D, Pathfinder, or any other fantasy driven RPG, this is a MUST buy. I enjoy this game with others, but for me, the solo experience is great. If you were ever wondering if it is possible to play an RPG solo, here it is. Buy it, play it. You won't regret it.\\n\\n\",\n",

I'm a big fan in general of cooperative games and dungeon-delving (I'm also very into d&d), and Gloomhaven held my interest for *years* of regular play. I'm not far into Jaws yet, but it feels basically the same, but with less work - clearly there's not as much content as in Gloomhaven, but it's seriously just as good a game.But unless you're very into tactical tabletop you should probably watch a video on how to play game before you get started, there's still a lot of rules to pick up.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  I was steadily playing Gloomhaven with a group for over a year at a friend's house, and I decided to pick up my own with an Amazon Honey watch at $80.  My purpose was to buy when still in print to play someday down the road with my family.  When the price hit my target I bought the game.Well, my 10 and 7 yr old sons saw the game and wanted to play.  We busted out all of the pieces and got everything organized into plano cases.  We did two games, which they were able to catch on to with the wife playing also, without much trouble.  The kids play Magic and are good at gaming.Fast forward five months later and we haven't played again.  The kids ask, but I have been reluctant to spend an hour to setup and another 30 mintues to go over the game again.  Then I saw on this version of Gloomhaven was out with a slim game and easier setup, but same play.  This was a perfect concept so I bought Jaws of the Lion from my local gameshop (couldn't wait for shipping).  We have played up to scenario 4 over one week.  We did get our but kicked on 4 and need to play again, but that happens.I really love the way they slowly guide you through the rules with Jaws of the Lion.  I'm a terrible teacher and the way this game is setup, it takes the teacher role out of my hands.  The guide walks you through the rules slowly kind of like a video game slowly introduces new abilities.  I also love how the setup is at least cut in half from the regular version.  With all that, that game play is exactly the same as normal Gloomhaven that we all love and has been the #1 game on Boardgamegeek for over 2 yrs.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  We are a gaming family with about 80 board games, so keep that in mind but in the past, my wife would ridicule Dungeons and Dragons.  When I brought up Gloomhaven (the original), her response would be, \"knock yourself out!\" with no interest in playing.  I think that it was largely intimidation - I mean the original Gloomhaven is HUGE!With Jaws of the Lion, I told her that it was designed to introduce the game to people who have never played D&D.  She looked at the first scenario and agreed to try it with me.  Happy to say, 12 plays later, she LOVES it!  She told me that it\\'s her new favorite game.  Then, she convinced both of my daughters (22 and 12) to play with us too!  The way that it \\'holds your hand\\' during the first few games has been all the difference, I believe.  Now we\\'re discussing getting the Original Gloomhaven once we complete this game.I love this game too, it\\'s been a ton of fun.  If I were to rate it based only on game play, it would easily be a 5 of 5.  But the game was missing cards (which were replaced, thank you) and from what I read, that is much too common, maybe as much as 25% of the boxes.If you do get this game, be sure to look at all of the components right away to make sure that you have everything.\\n\\n',\n",

This game eases you in real nice, and before you know it you’re having a great time and will want the original game. I actually prefer the way they did scenarios here compared to do just having tons of cardboard cut outs. It makes for easy setup and take down.

       "  '\\n\\n  Board gaming has been my main hobby for the last 8 years, and here is why this has become my favorite game in a landslide.  I purchased this at a friendly local game store but felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion has you teaming up with 1-3 other friends to form a party who go on various missions.  Each player has a deck of card. Each player picks two cards each turn to act out their special abilities from attacking, moving, healing, etc.  That is the core of the game.  What makes this game wonderful is all the other components around this main mechanic and the devotion put into its fairness/balance and other gameplay features.The game is played on a spiral bound book containing maps.  The first 5 scenarios slowly introduce rules one chunk at a time.  The phrase \"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time\" really applies here.  By the end of your fifth game, you have learned the rules of the game including how to move enemies, inflict poison, detonate traps, level up your character, and other items that add depth and strategy to the game.  By the way, leveling up is sooooooo satisfying when you get to update your attack modifier deck and add a new powerful card to your deck.The original Gloomhaven was too intimidating for me with too many rules and too long of a game. This game has made me comfortable with the rules, and I already look forward to buying full size Gloomhaven upon completing this lite version.  My gaming partner and I text all week about when we can get back together and play through a few more missions.We have twice finished a mission on the last card and performed a yelling, double high-five!  My wife upstairs wonders what in the heck we are doing in a board game to make us do that!  I can\\'t recommend this game enough.\\n\\n',\n",

I didn\\'t see a reason to own another giant game system. So I randomly came across this at in a Target store of all places and thought it looked interesting.

The contents are top notch, a great and fun rouge\\'s gallery, a couple VERY different characters to play as, and a attempt at a organizer... It could have been better but not something that I could see as a down fall. For $50 or less, if your a fan of any of the aforementioned genre or titles, i\\'de say you\\'ll fully enjoy this title.\\n\\n',\n",

My own daughters had loved Candy Land, but I no longer had that version, so I decided to purchase a new one. When I read some of the negative reviews of this version, I was a little hesitant and checked out the reviews for the classic version. It sounded like the older version was poorly made - thin cards, playing pieces that broke easily, so I decided to go with Sweet Adventures. Yes, the board is a little busy, but the path is clearly seen. The spaces on the path do seem smaller than I remember, but the pieces fit on there and my granddaughter had no trouble placing her piece on the appropriate space. A few of reviewers complained about some of the female characters being too sexy and the \"leering Spaniard\". When I opened the game I took a good look at the board and went back to those reviews with a \"what are you talking about\" frame of mind. The Ice Castle princess is no more provocative than Elsa, Jasmine, Belle in her ball gown, Pocahontas, or any other more recent female Disney character. The \"leering Spaniard\" is a pirate; he is supposed to be a villain. There was also a comment about there being no point to the game because there is no winner, but I assume the winner, if that is important to you, is the first player to reach the Castle. The bottom line for me was that my granddaughter and I had fun playing the game together while she is learning basic skills, including following directions and taking turns. She already knows colors, but this, too, is a skill that can be developed if a child doesn\\'t know them yet. There is no reading involved and counting only to two, so it is a perfect game for her age group.\\n\\n',\n",

Same idea, same game play, just lacks nostalgia (which has no impact on the kids, just us parents). Also, I don’t remember having so many double pieces as it has now, so the game goes by pretty fast.\\n\\n',\n",

I don't let them cheat and not go backwards, when they choose on of the character cards that they've already passed. I feel that it teaches them good gamesmanship and how they can't always get what they want (and how to deal with disappointment). We've ha some meltdowns and refusals to continue to play ... but these are life lessons that Candyland is teaching - so thankful for the opportunity to remember and share my childhood with my kids ... and also teach them how to be human beings. The game pieces are of the same quality, the board is the old-school type that folds in half and is solid. The cards are the same bendable (and too easily creased) quality that I remember in my childhood. The actual board/gamepath and the character cards have been redesigned. I prefer the old one where the cards were the actual people, rather than just symbols (e.g. a picture of the blue princess vs. a snowflake). I'm almost 40 and I still remember picking up that princess card and feeling like I won the lottery.\\n\\n\",\n",

The playing board is so small and the images and path are jam packed on the board completely taking away from the play space, story line and adventure! The board is so busy it is hard for small children to follow the path as it gets lost in all the pictures around it. Nor are they able to take in what is going in each section of the board as they travel through candy land to get to candy castle. All the colors are bold and bright making your eyes unable to focus as an adult let alone a three year old. This is a perfect example of less is more. There are so many cute details that just simply overlooked because are crammed on a small board. The game pieces hardly fit on each color square. I am very disappointed. Apparently, the board has been was redesigned many times and most recently in 2002 or somewhere around there. The 2002 version gives much more breathing room allowing kids of all ages to better take in what is happening in the game/story.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  I rate toys using a 3 category system. I look at their entertainment value, durability, and creativity. Every toy needs to keep a child's attention, be able to stand up to their rough playing, and either promote their creativity or be used to play in creative ways. I'll start with a short review and then explain my reasons for the rating in detail.We bought this for my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas, and it has been a big hit.  Her and her 2-year-old brother beg to play it everyday when I get home from work.  It is fun and colorful, and helps to teach them how to be patient and take turns as well as how to have fun, even if you don't finish first.ENTERTAINMENT:Candy land is simple enough for a 2-year old to figure out, and fun enough not to make the parents who have to play with them completely miserable.  It brings back memories from my childhood, so I have a lot of fun playing as well.My daughter loves counting the colors, and she loves narrating her path and telling stories about how she met Queen Frostine on her way to King Candy's castle.  My son loves drawing the cards and moving his piece along the path.DURABILTY:The board is very sturdy, but the cards get pretty messed up pretty quick.  My son has already crumpled up the cupcake card, so we know when that one is coming in the stack. There is a version of this game that has a spinner instead of cards, which they got from my brother for Christmas (what a coincidence), but my kids enjoy picking a card more than using the spinner.CREATIVITY:My daughter gets pretty creative telling stories about the Candy Land characters, but the best part about this game is that it teaches kids how to be patient and wait for their turn in a creative way.My kids are pretty patient for being toddlers, but they are still toddlers.  When they want something, they want it, and they usually aren't willing to wait for their turn.  But within a few minutes of playing, they were remarkably good at taking turns.  They cheered each other on, even if the other one just passed them up.  They loved every minute of it.Outside of game play, I have noticed them taking turns with toys and not fighting as much.  They still fight, just not as much. They share their toys a lot better.  I didn't expect that to happen. I don't think people really think that a board game would be able to teach kids life lessons, but its surprising how they carry the little things into their everyday interactions.In conclusion, this is a great way to introduce children to board games and teach them patience and good sportsmanship.  Its a must have for young children.\\n\\n\",\n",

She doesn't quite get the concept of the game yet and is a little bored with just moving her piece, but she likes the idea of being able to play one-on-one with an adult and without her younger sister - who really at 18 months just cannot be trusted not to mess it all up. We're working on the concepts of taking turns and following directions, and this is a good teacher.  You only need to know your colors and how to count to 2!  The only negative is the board design, although my granddaughter is fascinated with it.  It seems too bright and busy and kind of distracting for a child who often just wants to discuss the scenes.  It's still bound to be a favorite, as expected, and we play at least once a day.\\n\\n\",\n",

Took us a long time, especially the decoding, just that alone took us 1 hr and total it was about 3 hours.  We are extremely thorough though and would try to pick apart every single piece of evidence.  We had a sense of who it was earlier in the game before the coding though but wanted every last piece of evidence to fully PROVE who the killer was.  I think unfortunately it left us mildly unsatisfied at the end when we didn’t really get a full explanation, I was almost hoping for a play by play of what exactly happened that night during the murder but instead it was more so “this is who it is, they’re in jail” type situation.  I loved the details and how “authentic” every piece of evidence felt.  There was even some humor in the clues which was a good break up of some laughs in some “serious” discovery.  All the details definitely made us think there would be a more detailed description at the end so we have no questions or “how did it fully happen” type scenarios in our heads.  Overall we would definitely get more though because the process was super fun, hoping the ending to future games is as detailed as the rest of the game.\\n\\n',\n",

I have investigated and solved mysteries of all varieties from Hunt A Killer, usually at a cost upward of $150, as a deluxe box set, a premium mystery, and as the classic subscription Mystery consisting of 6 episodes each.  I was very excited when I learned that this was being made available to a wider audience for a MUCH LOWER COST. At $30.00 - this is an amazing value and opportunity!  The high quality that is the Hunt a Killer reputation is 100% applicable to THIS Mystery despite the low cost.  I hope that people will utilize this Mystery to learn how wonderful the Hunt A Killer experience can be, perhaps as a \"test\" before committing to a long term subscription.  For those of us already aware of, and members of, the Hunt A Killer subscription family - utilize this opportunity to grab a fun quality mystery for your own enjoyment or as a gift. I don\\'t know how, if you want to take your time and enjoy the experience, it could be solved in 45-60 minutes.  It took me hours to organize, investigate, and solve the mystery.  However, I was in no hurry and was taking my time, working alone, for pure enjoyment.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  Back in the early 2000's, we used to do Murder Mystery Parties with our group of friends. They were kits in boxes where everyone was assigned a character and we followed a loose script to solve the mystery. This is nothing like that. It's an upgraded version for sure. I would describe it as somewhat similar to an escape room experience, but instead of trying to escape, you are solving a murder. There are no characters to assign which is a relief! I hated trying to assign characters without offending people. And the characters were assigned genders so if you didn't have an even number of guys and girls, someone would have to play the opposite. It was never a big deal in my group of friends, but it could be for some.  Here you are the detective and team doing the solving. It comes with all kinds of fun evidence. There's a newspaper clipping that looks like a real newspaper clipping. There's a traffic ticket, photos, and so much more. I was very impressed with the level of creativity that went into it. The old style mystery boxes would have silly clues that didn't look real. This is so much cooler! If you use pencil or write out notes on your paper, you could easily pass this set onto someone else.\\n\\n\",\n",

It's truly like you're a private investigator and you have to solve the murder of the owner of Old Scratch Tavern.  They give you tons of items in the box to investigate different suspects.  You even have to learn to crack codes to decipher clues to figure out the mystery. The items included are neat, because they look so real...an old newspaper article, restaurant menus, coasters, crime scene photos, etc. It can be played with as few as one person or as many as you want, in a group. It's great because your group can work together to solve the crime,no matter how many people you have working on it.  It's an awesome idea for a date night or a large party to play together! It is only a one time game...once you figure out the killer, you can't play again. However, you can pass it on to someone else you know that hasn't played it yet! Nothing in the box will be ruined for the next people to play.  Considering you can only play it once, it seems a little pricey, however, it's definitely worth the cost for the entertainment! It's such a unique game experience, I can't recommend it enough!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Within the past year I got into board games and over this year I have acquired a decent collection and have played a variety of games in terms of themes and difficulty. I\\'m pretty hooked! When Azul won the Spiel des Jahres in 2018 I \"had\" to buy it. I wanted to get in on a hot new game to understand why it\\'s well revered. Since buying it I\\'ve played about 12 games, mostly 2 players, but a few 4 player games and it\\'s a blast.The game revolves around picking up tiles and placing them to score points, that is the most simplistic explanation. The game start off slowly without much tension, but as your board fills up the game becomes pretty cutthroat as you try to force your opponent to take tiles that will cause them to lose points while mitigating the point loss on your own board. It requires thinking ahead and critical thinking. It\\'s a fantastic board game that takes 1 round to teach, and many rounds to develop a strategy.There are Youtube videos to learn the game easily, don\\'t be hesitant if you\\'re looking for pretty game that is suitable for the family that will help keep your brain sharp. Azul is well worth the price.My only issue with Azul is that there are some beautiful tile designs on the board game cover that are not available in the game. The plain red and blue tiles would benefit from having some beautiful designs like the cover indicates. Otherwise, I have no caveats with this game. The components are nice to hold and look at, and the game is fun to play.\\n\\n',\n",

The new game arrived today and again the player boards are ripped around the edges, the box was crushed a little on the side, and very cheap pieces. Some of the symbols were printed off-center on the small square pieces. We are not happy to get the same game twice in a row with cheap pieces and poor quality.I contacted Amazon customer service, and they weren't willing to give us any type of refund on the game, unless I returned again. It's annoying to keep going back and forth to the post office to return items. The pictures speak for themselves. No one wants a new item to be delivered damaged twice in a row.The gameplay is great. I really recommend it, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the 2 games we bought, and how poor customer service has been in working with us.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  This is a revised review. I wrote the below review soon after purchasing the game. It took the company 6 months to replace the defective parts, but better late than never.The game itself seems good. However, the copy I received was defective in a couple ways:1) The game comes with a cloth bag for putting in tiles. The bag came with a rip2) The game comes with 4 \"player boards\". They must produce them in sheets with multiple boards per sheet, and then someone \"tears\" them apart. In this process, two of our boards had their edges torn. It doesn\\'t affect playability, but it does impact aesthetics.I expect a game company to stand by its products and send replacements. I contacted the company online a week ago and have received absolutely no response. I sent them another email and received no response. At minimum, I expect a company to respond to communications.\\n\\n',\n",

Sure enough, the honor is worth it.  My wife and I really enjoy the game.  We tried it out for the first time this weekend, just the two of us.  After playing a few rounds, thinking we would call it a night, we kept deciding to play \"just one more game\".The setup is very simple.  The rules are overall easy, but they can be just a little confusing at first when you\\'re trying to figure out the point of the game.  After watching a couple of \"how to play\" videos on YouTube, we got it and off we went.  When you play, the first few rounds seem pretty simple.  But as you get further in the game, the gameplay really tightens up and you have to think of the best way to move forward.  Do you go for extra points?  Or do you try to block your opponents from getting theirs?  It\\'s both simple in design, and a little complex in strategy.  Love that!The build quality of the game is pretty high. Each player gets their own game board that is nice and solid/stiff.  The \"store\" disks are fairly sturdy and remind you of cardboard coasters (these would be the least sturdy of the whole set).  The tiles are very sturdy and well made.  And the tile bag is nice and thick fabric.  Overall, it\\'s a very attractive and well executed design.I can see us enjoying this game for many years.  I\\'m looking forward to my next round.\\n\\n',\n",

As with most great games on the surface it is easy enough for kids 10+ to play, the more you play the more you learn there are multiple strategies. After a few rounds, you learn that it is not best to be the first to \"win\" by completing a row to end the game. You actually get more points by having all of the tiles of a color or completing a column.  You need to watch your board and the other players board to devise your completing a row strategy.After two rounds, the  kids were able to hold their own with a few strategic hints.The more you play, the more you learn to play smart rather than fast. Once you tackle the strategies you can take the game to a whole new level by flipping the game board over and play the blank wall  option.  The game boards are thick, substantial cardboard and the tiles are colorful, thick, plastic pieces.  This is not a game you will play a few times and get bored with. I see there is an expansion kit of Joker tiles, which will add a whole new curve ball to the game.  I hope to add that to my collection soon.\\n\\n',\n",

Today I played this game four times back to back.My only issue was a rule that did not seem to be practically explained.  I looked up what people were saying about this rule on BGG and found that it was explained there well.  For all intensive purposes, when you draft tiles, you go around the players and draft until they are ALL taken during each round.  We mistakenly thought that you only drafted once around the table, and that was a round.  Once we got the rules right, I was thankful because this is really a good strategy/puzzle game.

Once you start playing, the instructions seem relatively simple, but you will soon realize how many things need to be considered to optimize scoring. And we only did a two-player game -- with 3 or 4 players the game would get even more intricate, depending on how many people are willing to play in a more cutthroat fashion.As with any game of this style you can decide to play to build yourself up or to try to bring your opponent(s) down. Additionally, it is the type of game you don\\'t need to worry about having one \"bad\" round early on, because fortunes can change pretty quickly. Frankly, I am a poor sport. But a game like this makes me not care so much about losing because you can remain competitive despite mis-steps here and there (other games are not so forgiving, and tend to make me want to give up).I do think the \"Ages 8 and up\" may be a bit aggressive, but maybe that is only because we have an 8 year old who is a bad sport like her dad, and isn\\'t as easy-going about those special few games where the joy of playing overrides the outcome -- she still just wants to win.  *smile*  I do think an average eight-year-old could get the hang of it after a few plays, through.\\n\\n',\n",

It has been played by ages 8-60 and we all love it. I watched a video on YouTube before purchasing and thought it looked so-so, but once I played it I couldn't stop!This is an abstract game. Essentially you draw tiles with an interesting drafting system and place them in rows on your board. The rows have room for 1-5 tiles of one color and when all tiles have been drafted you score the completed rows. You score more for tiles that connect (like Scrabble) and cannot place same colors in rows or columns (like Sudoku).It's simple but there are so many decisions to make! There is a lot of luck in which tiles appear in a round but you can employ different strategies based on available tiles and the number of players.The game is beautiful and the tiles are just amazing! They have a good, solid feel and look stunning on the board. Maybe that adds to the addiction?I prefer this to similar games: Sagrada and Reef. AZUL is a bit easier, but the game play goes faster and seems more satisfying at the end of the day.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  First off, let\\'s get it out of the way--this is a fun game, very visually pleasing, and the scoring is a sneaky way to get your kid to work on math skills.But I think what\\'s really impressive about this game is that it allows an adult to play the game \"down\" to a kid\\'s level without feeling like you\\'re throwing the game. Simply put: it\\'s a fun game to play, and you can easily turn off your cut-throat long-term strategy brain and just have fun with it, while your kid does her/his own thing--and it doesn\\'t bore you because you\\'re beating the pants off of your opponent, or taking it easy on them.And that\\'s what I really like about this game. Besides the fact there are no dice, no shuffling of cards, no secret hands, no need for randomization or pre-scripted events. You take turns picking tiles from the bag and even if one person is \"stacking\" the factories, since you take turns, you can\\'t guarantee your cheating will help you--or your opponent. My kids have \"favorite\" tile colors, and that\\'s fine.So this game is very replay-able. And even when my son (who isn\\'t a good loser) loses, he had fun building his tiles, and at times he has found a way to \"stick it to me\" in a round so I take a big point loss, and he counts that as a little victory even if he doesn\\'t win the game. My son is under the recommended age, so this game is easy to learn and play. Maybe he doesn\\'t have the best strategy, but that\\'s the best thing about this game--you don\\'t have to have the best strategy to have fun playing it.Plus, it just plain looks pretty.I should note, most of my play has been head-to-head with one or the other of my kids. It gets more complex with more players.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  I've been looking forward to playing this game for awhile. Looks great and I thought it would be a fun strategy game. Unfortunately, its not much of a strategy game. After playing a two player game, we realized that there is no penalty for using the 1 or two square lines to fill in the tiles. This means that its literally a 5 round (5 minute game) to win. There's no strategy involved in finding tiles, trading tiles, stealing tiles. Its literally just picking up tiles and putting them on the board. Winning involves adding up points, but when anyone can end the game at any time, there's no incentive to go for high points. We literally started making up rules to attempt to force the game to be a little bit challenging. For instance, not being able to end the game without making a plus sign of tiles, or an 'x' across the board, etc. Even with that, it was a pretty lackluster experience.The tiles are pretty and the board looks great. It would be nice if the tiny black score keeper block was heavier or magnetized as its really easy to bump/swipe/move it off the board accidentally. The cardboard game boards are thick, but don't lie down completely flat, and this makes that piece sit even more precariously.Overall, this general conclusion about this game is that it is missing something. Not sure exactly what, but there needs to be added element to make this compelling. The tragedy is that this game feels really close to being really good. But without that extra thing, it comes across as half-baked and fairly lackluster.\\n\\n\",\n",

The rules are easy to grasp and by the end of the first few turns, you’ll feel like you have the hang of it. However, the strategies are complex. You must take risks, pursue a strategy, and keep an eye on your opponents’ moves. Games aren’t terribly long which is perfect as I find myself demanding rematches after a loss or wanting to improve my high score after a win.The game itself is beautiful giving you the feeling that you are completing a masterpiece as the game goes on.I recommend this game to both serious and casual gamers.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nBeginners and Veteran gamers alike can have a good time together playing\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n  Azul is a 2 to 4 player tile laying game. The game ends after a row is completed, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.For a four player Setup, each player will receive a player board with scoring cube. Nine circle disks called \"factory displays\" will be placed in a circle at the center of the table. On each disk there will be four randomly drawn tiles from the tile bag.GameplayFactory Offer: A player will need to choose a set of same colored tiles from either a \"factory display\" or the center table area of the nine disks. When tiles are chosen from the \"factory display\" the tiles that remain will move to the center table area. When choosing tiles from the center table area, if the player is the first to do this, they will gather a set of one tile type and obtain the first player marker, and go first in the next round. After choosing tiles, players will place their chosen tile/s on their player board in one of the five pattern lines. These pattern lines range from one square to five squares. All tiles must be placed on the same pattern line as players are not allowed to split up their tiles. Any tiles that cannot be place are moved to the Floor Line that gives the player negative victory points for each wasted tile. After all tiles have been chosen this phase will end.Wall-tiling: All players may do this at the same time, players will now move finished Pattern Lines to their respective Wall areas on their player board. Players will start with the One Pattern Line and end on the Fifth Pattern Line. Players will discard excess tiles of completed rows as only one tile is moved. Scoring will be one point for placing a single tile. However, players will score a point for every 1 or more tile that is connected horizontally or vertically. Then finally negative points will be applied from the Floor Line.Preparing the Next Round: If no one has completed a horizontal line of five tiles than another round will begin. The first player will draw four tiles for each \"factory display\", and then place the first player marker in the center table area.End of Game: When a player completes a horizontal row during the Wall-tiling phase the game is over at the end of the round. Players will do one final scoring, and score additional points for complete horizontal lines (2 points), complete vertical lines (7 points), and covering all tiles belonging to one tile type (10 points). The player will the most points is the winner of the game.Azul is a great game for those beginning to get into board games, and veterans that play all the time. The reason being is it is a fast game with some depth. The game goes by fast for first time players, but that speed increases when people play it again. It works great as a filler game, and something lite enough for people to get into without feeling like they need to spend time learning it. The depth of the game comes from how tiles are placed, and how strategic players want to be. That strategy is looking at what tiles they will risk taking in negative victory points to obtain more victory points at the end, or at that moment. The game can also be mean by player choice as individuals can force a player to take on a lot of negative victory points because they were not counting on everyone passing up a set of tiles. Also, players can choose to pay attention to what they are leaving behind because sometimes someone could set someone else up for a terrific play. Azul, again, is a great game for everyone that likes playing board games. It works exceptionally well as a beginner game, but it is not the type of beginner game that intermediate players will have an issue with playing.Teaching the game: Emphasize that players should pay attention to what tiles they are taking in later turns as they can not only setup other players, but they can give themselves a lot of negative victory points. From this, remember that a Pattern Line cannot have the same tile placed that has already been placed on a players board. Also, the first Pattern Line is only one tile, so the game is moving towards ending rather quickly as the average game is 5 to 7 rounds. For even more advance play, the other side of the player board has a blank wall devoid of any tile type. On this side players must choose where to place their tile with the rule being the same tile type cannot be found in one row.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Improvements:1. I drew an arrow on a piece of paper and switched the direction of play after each wall tiling. This reduces frustration if the person to your right is looking for the same pieces.2. The instructions could be better at explaining that you are to continue drawing tiles until there are none left before scoring.  It took one confused round before carefully reading the instructions again for this detail.3. Discard into a bowl instead of the box lid, because it\\'s difficult to transfer from the box lid to the bag without dropping tiles on the floor.What I like:- Everyone gets to play on every turn, unlike some games like Catan- It\\'s easy to learn the rules and get started- There\\'s some complexity, strategy, randomness, and chance- Very reasonable price for this attractive and fun game- The number of tiles \"offered\" per round seems well balanced for the 2-player and 4-players games I tested.\\n\\n',\n",

I love games that have good replayability and this is one of those games. In addition, I'm always look for ways to modify rules to make game play even better. We love this game, but the original rules do not allow for a very fun game. In the original rules, the game ends when you have one horizontal line (+2pts). The problem is playing with this rule everyone goes for the top line and the game lasts 5 minutes. However, we changed the following rules to add more strategy and to speed up the game:1) the game ends when a player creates one vertical line (+7pts) and allow people to score as many horizontal (+2pts) and all 5 same color tiles (+10pts)2) immediate scoring and therefore we do not wait until all of the tiles in the middle are gone (which allows a player to complete multiple tiles in a row)\\n\\n\",\n",

It looks simple but there\\'s enough strategy and variety in it to reward multiple plays.  There\\'s a lot of room within this deceptively simple setup to try different styles of play. Your game experience could be contemplative OR aggressive, depending on you and your opponents\\' temperaments. It\\'s possible to play this game as a kind of \"multi-player solitaire\" wherein you and your opponents are just trying to make pretty pictures on your own player boards. Or you can go on the attack and do your best to deny your opponents the tiles they need and leave them with a bunch of penalty tiles they are forced to take.If you are just getting further into the board game hobby (moving past \"gateway games\") and getting into something deeper, or perhaps have a friend who is just getting into it, this is a great game to ask for or give as a gift. It\\'s maybe a bit too complex for younger players or for people who are complete novices in the new realm of board games, but, hey, they can always just admire the pretty tiles. I would give it five stars but a) I hardly ever do that unless a game is a stone-cold classic and b) the rule book was not entirely helpful.

We often get our grandchildren started with games by simply playing with the parts, getting used to the board and tile pieces.  Even our four year old grandson likes making patterns with the tile pieces.  Our eight year old granddaughter asks to play Azul- and she is good at it.  There is an option to the way in which the game is played, using the back side of the game board, making your own patterns.

The first couple rounds we played wrong because we weren't clear on the instructions.  We thought you refilled the factories after everyone took a turn.  We watched a few videos and then it cleared things up for us and since then the game has been fun.  I have actually been able to play a few rounds with my three year old.  She doesn't understand  the rules well enough to make a decided strategy, but she picks the colors that she likes and then I help her place them on her board.Overall I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game to play with a small group of people or if you are looking for something just for you and a partner to play.\\n\\n\",\n",

Similarly, the box has already split up the corner because it's flimsy and a little too tight.

The scoring is a little hard to grok at first, seems like at least 1 person messes it up the first time, but doing scoring together the first couple rounds usually clears it up. I like the feel of the pieces. Everything is good quality. The tiles look/feel good and are a good weight, the cardboard is all thick and feels solid, the scoring cubes are simple and effective, and the first player marker is the same bake-lite material as the rest of the tiles in all new versions (old versions had a cardboard piece that people didn't notice and threw out, then complained there wasn't a first player marker . . . ) To illustrate component quality/durability, I let my 2.5 and 4.5 year olds play with the pieces without worry.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  This is the base game.  I can\\'t emphasize that enough.  This review will only handle the base game, minus expansions.LEARNING CURVE:  This game is extraordinarily simple and straightforward to learn.  Played once through, it makes plenty of sense and opens doors to more complex rules and gameplay.GAME SPEED:  1-2 hours for 4 players.  Game moves briskly but with obvious early-, mid-, and end-game stages that each have their own strategies and approaches.  Game easily resumed from a paused state if you take a break.GAMEPLAY OVERALL:  Catan is satisfying to play, even more satisfying to win.  As a game best played with a poker face and a good set of bluffing skills, Catan rewards long-term foresight and strategies more than rushed or brute-forced gameplay techniques.  Catan can become repetitive IF and ONLY IF you refuse to play randomly.  I highly recommend players who have a few games under their belt learn to completely randomize the map, starting positions, and resource entitlement for more satisfying experiences.APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS?  Depends on your child.  Children with a knack for puzzles and strategy games will find playing Catan with adults to be very rewarding.  Probably a bit too complex for children to play with each other, however; too many \"honor system\" concepts in play, too easy to cheat each other.APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS?  Gameplay can easily be catered for adults or children with special needs.  Game rules are insanely simple and easily modified for those wanting additional assistance.  Communities online for adapting Catan gameplay are prevalent and easily found.CONCLUSION:  Catan is a fantastically easy game to pick up and learn, but complex and difficult to master.  Catan is a game best suited to be expanded and enhanced, as the base game is truly just the first step into the world of Catan.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I like it, but it\\'s not quite a five-star game for me because I\\'ve since discovered other games which I enjoy playing more than this one.Pros:- Popular enough that many people already know how to play, and easy enough to teach those who don\\'t- \"Gateway\" game for empire-building and resource management types of games- Involves some strategy and risk managementCons:- Winner/loser inertia: As you build more things, your production tends to accelerate. If you fall behind, it becomes progressively harder to catch up.- Occasional \"dead\" turns: Sometimes a player\\'s turn consists of rolling the dice and nothing else, because they didn\\'t get any resources since their last turn. Two of those in a row makes it difficult to stay engaged, and it\\'s more likely to happen early in the game when that matters most.- Dice rolls dominate the game: The best-laid strategies can be overpowered by a stretch of reasonably bad luck.In my opinion, Ticket to Ride or Splendor would both be superior options for a \"gateway\" game, because they both offer greater strategic depth, faster gameplay, easier setup, simpler rules, and comparable price. Both of those games also have plenty of randomness, but in both cases, you\\'re still playing and engaged on every turn, even when luck isn\\'t on your side.The relatively recent Explorers and Pirates expansion to Catan fixes many of my issues with the game, but that expansion is basically a new game which uses some of the original components and game mechanics, and it\\'s significantly more expensive.\\n\\n',\n",

Another thing I like about Settlers of Catan is it\\'s more about achieving a personal goal than \"beating\" the other players; the first person to get 10 \"Victory Points\" is the winner. The rules are easy to learn, but mastery of the game takes a long time. This is a great alternative to having the kids play video games or use their \"devices\".

If you're a very competitive gamer and like Eurogames, you'll really like Catan.2. If you're not a very competitive player but still like Eurogames, change a few of the rules and you'll still really like Catan.If you don't like Eurogames, you may not like this. The game revolves around you strategizing placement of buildings and roads to earn more resources to build more buildings and roads to achieve a determined set number of points to win. How much you compete with/against other players is kind of based on each player's personality. I don't like games where players try to sabotage one another, so I hate playing this game with certain types of people; on the other hand, when playing with people like me, we have a great time playing and competing for the goal without trying to sabotage the other.I really like this game and think it has a lot of replayability, especially when you throw in the expansions.

I've gotten friends and family members who've only ever played games such as Card Against Humanity to not only play, but truly enjoy it.As mentioned the game is easy to pick up and the rules are straight forward. I typically recommend watching a YouTube video about the rules if no one in the group has played. There are some great videos under 10 minutes explaining all the rules.Setting up the game takes only a few minutes. Although, when the game is brand new it will take just as bit longer as you have to open everything for the first time. Ahh new game smell!It's highly recommend that you play on a flat surface and on a table when possible. There are a decent amount of pieces overall. Bags are included to put all the pieces away at the end.This game makes such a great gift for many occasions such as a birthday, anniversary, Christmas, Valentine's, or even just because!There are expansions to the game as well, but this original game is a solid start to what very well could become an addiction.If you found this review helpful, make sure to hit that 'helpful' button down below.\\n\\n\",\n",

The game cannot go on forever in a stale mate type situation, once you get your first couple of games out of the way the games usually take about 12 to 15 minutes per player to finish.  3 player game once experienced should take about 45 minutes.

The game is made very well which makes it more enjoyable to us and gives us a stronger desire to keep the game in good condition.Cons:Setup takes longer than the average board game.  still less than 5 minutes but hey, I wanted to write something under con.  The really only con i see to this game is that you are limited to four players or less unless you buy the expansion pack.Summary:Great game for people who like board games that involve some strategy.

Lots of fun to get the family around a board game again, and away from the video games and cell phones.  The strategy is simple: collect resource cards (sheep, brick, stone, straw, and lumber) in order to build settlements, expand roads, and eventually build cities.  Resources can be traded with other players and rewards can be claimed (longest road, largest \"army\") and as you work your way through the process of developing the land, the first player to reach ten points wins.  This is perfect for three to four players; five or more players can play as well, but the game play is pretty crowded and fast at that point, so you would be well advised to purchase the extension pack at that point.My initial thought when looking at this game was that the price seemed a bit high for what I thought was a complicated Parcheesi (hah!) but we played a couple of games with my daughter and son-in-law, and we were hooked.  Set aside an hour or two for a game, but don\\'t be surprised to find you\\'ve spent six hours on three or four games.  It\\'s addicting, and it\\'s a blast.\\n\\n',\n",

Only someone who had never played Catan could consider this acceptable. The wooden pieces fall between the tiles and the whole board moves constantly. It is so annoying when playing the game, and I am very unhappy. The playing cards are also noticeably thinner than they are supposed to be and the colors are slightly different (compared with the genuine 5-6 player expansion that I got from 3rd party seller Shopville.com).I contacted Asmodee, with photos (that I can't seem to attached here) and they confirmed that it is a counterfeit version. I do not live in the US, so none of the Return options are possible for me. Very disappointed Amazon.com!\\n\\n\",\n",

It takes a couple of games to understand the concept and a few games to fully know how to play it. So far my 7 year old nephew and 78 year old grandma have been able to understand the game. It's fun playing the base game but with the 6 player expansion it becomes even better. Every game the board gets shifted around so you're always playing with a new board which requires different strategies to play. I would really recommend this game to anyone that would like to try a new board game. So far we've given away 3 copies and another 4 families have bought it after playing it with us.Pros:Replay value is greatNot difficult to learnUp to 6 players with expansionCons:Can take an 1-1.5 hrs to play a game depending on how many people are playing and how slow they areBoard pieces are made of cardboard and can be easily damaged\\n\\n\",\n",

Be careful here and read the advice in the pamphlets that come with the game to prevent damaging the cardboard/paper pieces. I recommend that you sit with some YouTube videos on game play to understand how the game flows. We tried initially through just reading the documentation. It was ok, but once we watched a video we realized we mis-read some sections and the game flowed much better after the video. We have only played the game with the standard configuration (which balances the board), but there is the option to randomize the tiles. I think we will be moving to the randomized version to mix up the starting strategies the players keep repeating. Love that there are player expansion options available for purchase, as well.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  An excellent game that is not long and tedious as monopoly can get (there is a clear end of the tunnel/goal to get to and you can see when the game is coming to a close).The goal is to strategically build places along the right resources, build roads and settlements based on resources . But to get the resources- ah here is where the strategy is- the factors are 1. putting yourself in squares where the chances of rolling that number on dice is high and also figuring out what resources is best to monopolize to and where to build near to, so that one can expand easily. Great game for ages 12 and older- may be a little trickier for those who are younger. Does not require much language understanding and can be learned within 1 game.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  (Off-the-bat Disclaimer: When you open up the box containing your Catan game, I\\'m afraid that it won\\'t contain the Lego Catan board displayed in my photos. The photos represent a Lego creation that I made on my own for fun. I figured there were enough photos of the actual game pieces attached to other reviews, and that nothing else could better showcase how much I absolutely love this game!)I have played Catan hundreds and hundreds of times over the years, ever since my parents first ordered it when I was a child. Now I love playing it with my wife and family friends, and we even maintain a long-term score sheet to keep track of who has won the most games, and how many points each of us won per game (see photo). I am a full-on unashamed \"Catan Supernerd\", and look forward to playing it hundreds of more times. Here are some highlights:BRIEF SYNOPSIS: In this game, you and your fellow players assume the roles of rival bands of settlers who are racing to populate and develop the island of Catan. You strategically choose where to place your first settlements, based on what resources you can expect to harvest/mine from the surrounding countryside, and expand from there! However, to fully expand your influence on the island, you need to engage in resource trades with other players to strengthen your army, build roads, and construct settlements and cities. The game ends when one player accumulates 10 points and earns the coveted title of \"Settler of Catan!\"AGE RANGE: 8-108. Easy to learn for all ages!TIME TO PLAY: 60 minutes for beginners (or games with \"really bad islands\" [only a few wood/ore/brick available]), but can go as quick as 30 minutes for experienced players.BEST ELEMENTS OF GAMEPLAY:-Simplicity: Probably my favorite thing about Catan is that it\\'s so simple, but its randomness (discussed below) makes it so it never gets old! There are literally only four things you can do throughout the game: build roads, construct settlements, upgrade your settlements to cities, and buy \"development cards\" (like wild cards that help you.) You can learn how to play this game in 15 minutes, but it will never, ever get old.-Randomness: The island of Catan changes every time you play, with different placements of resources and ports between games, along with different probabilities that each resource will be rolled. One of the keys to each game is determining which resource(s) will be scarce and planning your builds accordingly.-Other-Player Interaction/Trades: You simply cannot win at Catan without trading with other players! It\\'s so fun to see how much you can get for your rare resources, even though you\\'re constantly worrying that the trades you make will help your opponents more than they help you. That\\'s part of the fun!SUGGESTED \"HOUSE RULES\"-Full Randomization: The game recommends an \"A-R\" order for the 18 numbers that determine which dice rolls are associated with each resource, but we prefer to assign numbers to resource tiles completely randomly. This makes for a more dynamic game, since you can have settlements that simultaneously touch two \"8\" hexagons, for example.-No Robber: Rather than playing with the robber (an attack feature that comes up whenever a \"7\" is rolled), we like to make sure that everyone meets the required 7-card limit and then re-roll the dice. Then, when someone plays a Knight Development Card, they get to pick a free resource from the bank.-Avoiding the 7+ Card Trap: When we have hands that we REALLY don\\'t want to lose, we give the player whose turn it is whatever cards we need to get our hand back down to 7. It\\'s like taking out an insurance policy on your hand, but you have to be careful because it can tip the scale and give your opponent a power turn!-Future Trades: When I really need to make a trade happen, I like to offer my opponents available resources in my hand while also promising them a resource that I\\'ll get later. For example, \"If you give me a brick, I\\'ll give you a sheep now and also my next wood.\"I could go on and on with additional strategies and quirks of the game, but suffice it to say here that this is one of my very favorite board games and I look forward to playing it for years to come. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Happy Settling!\\n\\n',\n",

We play by slightly different rules:1, we rotate the numbers every 10 minutes- outside clockwise, inside counterclockwise.2, if a seven is rolled, the person has the choice of rolling again, or pulling a single resource card from the bank. We don't use the robber at all- it caused too much contention.3, in order to make the games shorter (2 hours per game 😱), we only build roads leading to ports where we can trade.We kept all other rules.

We just don\\'t get how this game could be the best selling game of all time around the world. It\\'s tedious. It\\'s slow. It\\'s boring. It\\'s a time waster and we found ourselves in a circular series of moves that at no point brought either of us any satisfaction. In fact, the \"winner\" was so happy to be done with the effing game and had no desire to brag or do a victory dance. It was more like, \"Finally! It\\'s done.\" Way too expensive of a game to produce this kind of response.Reminded us of an extremely boring game of Monopoly--but Monopoly is high octane and loads more fun compared to this!We are so perplexed by its draw that we are going to do some on line research and see how we are missing all the \"fun\" and \"addiction\" folks in other reviews went on about.

It was very complicated to learn for me because I’m not into strategy games but my husband and son caught on quick. I think it helps if you are a competitive family that isn’t afraid to rob other family members and play aggressively. That really kept the our teenagers interested.

This is a great strategy game that isn't hard to learn, but like an onion there are many levels to peal back.  While the game is pretty easy to learn, the strategy is what makes it so fun.  There is no one perfect strategy, which means every game can be different.  We change the rules sometimes and play to 12 which makes games go a little longer and requires you to use more strategy to win. I have probably played this games close to 500 times and I really never get sick of it. Being a strategy game, it is definitely not for everyone.  I have probably introduced 20-30 people to this game and only a handful didn't love it, which is understandable.  If you have never tried it then you should give it a go because it really is awesome.  I also love the updated board and pieces as my old Settlers version is pretty ratty and drab.

To win, you must be cunning, but not so much that everyone gangs up to make sure you don't win.DON'T even BOTHER reading the rules if you don't know how to play, because they're only written to provide clarifications upon the inevitable ensuing arguments about the rules. You will need a worthy and patient veteran to explain how to start a game. Because this is a game that involves both strategy - PARTICULARLY at the SETUP part before 'regular gameplay' starts - AND luck, you will either be extremely unlucky, or extremely lucky that you are not the extremely unlucky one in your first game.Yes, this is similar to Risk in the way that one is competing for finite resources on a shared field. But instead of dice rolls determining the outcome of battles, dice rolls determine your income of resources. And instead of choosing an ally or enemy to attack and conquer, you make trade requests to fulfill your construction which awards points. It's diplomatic in a different way. Veteran Catan players who are consistently paying attention could probably have a quick game under 40 minutes, but any game involving newbies will require a lot of explaining before the game can even begin, and then strategizing is another issue after that.\\n\\n\",\n",

You should have a similar experience, especially once you and your opponents have a firm grasp on the rules and flow of the game.OVERALL - 5/5Catan is a fun, yet competitive board game that will both bring out the wild competitor in you and bring you closer to your friends! I highly recommend this game, especially to those of you who love board games. This has become a staple for our family and friends.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Got the game as a birthday present for our teenage son, who played it before and mentioned that he liked it. I am not a fan of games with many pieces and long playtimes, I like streamlined games like backgammon, mancala, RummyCub.  Therefore I had my doubts if we would enjoy this new addition to our game library. And after a month playing it - we are totally hooked! The first couple of games took 90 - 120 min. to finish, but once we all got used to it, things sped up, and the full round usually takes less than 60 min. The record was 30 min.  Our 12 y.o. likes playing the Settlers of Catan, and won a couple of games. Different strategies, dice rolls and development cards make the game variable and unpredictable. We enjoy it so much that recently got the first expansion - the Seafarers. The game is very exciting, beautifully made, and a pleasure to play.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  This game effectively combines elements of Monopoly, casino craps, and Risk. After setup the gameplay is simple enough that a first-time player can win; however, there is enough strategy and minor details to the game to keep your family brainiacs addicted.Here are a few findings that we noticed after over 12 hours of gameplay. Development cards: we found that players who focused on buying development cards instead of expanding their territory almost always won. We cannot tell if this is a flaw in the game's design or if the ability to buy the most development cards relates to the player's superior placement of her pieces at the start.The amount of space on the board is the reason for the 3-4 player designation. With three you rarely compete with others for space, but with four it feels cramped.It is absolutely crucial that you start with the recommended setup and that you follow the recommendations for randomizing the board. A poor setup almost guarantees that the first player will win.Overall, the game is not perfect but it is the best game for adults that my family and I have ever played.\\n\\n\",\n",

The box is more sturdy then most games now a days and it is packaged very well. You have to pop out all the land pieces and sort the houses and roads. There is a very descriptive guide book with a set of rules and an almanac for looking up specific information so you don't have to sort through the rules. They also have built a phone app that lets you learn the game on your phone by playing so I sent them the link to that and they learned ahead of time since they've never played before. The game itself has a sort of Civilization, turn based strategy sort of feel to it. There is no direct fighting, but you gather resources to build your empire and trade with other people. You have to try to balance the trades because you need to help yourself without helping others too much. I wouldn't suggest this for a casual board game player, it is a bit more involved, but it doesn't take too much to learn it and there is a high ceiling for skill once you get the hang of it. So people who love strategy will go crazy. One of my favorite games of all time and this version was well done.\\n\\n\",\n",

It is really easy to learn, has lots of different aspects to it, and because of the changing game board it feels like you are never playing the same game. I absolutely love it! I wanted to give this game a 5-star, but I was really disappointed to find that it was missing a lot of the red pieces which really makes this a three player game since we don't have the pieces we need for the 4th. That's a pretty major problem for a fairly pricey game, but it just didn't seem worth it to send the whole thing back. Since I mostly just play it with my son anyway, we've made due without the missing pieces. I've seen we aren't the only ones who have had this problem too, so I would check/count your game pieces carefully if you do decide to order this game.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nExcellent classic game that everyone should try!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n  Me and my husband enjoy playing board games and we were not new to Catan, in fact, it has been one of our favorite games since we got into the board game world. We already owned the \"Settlers\" and \"Rivals\" versions of Catan and when we learned of the Black Friday deals on board games, we decided it was the time to have our own version of this game as well (especially since we used to play with some friends and their copy, so us recently moving into another city also played as a factor to buy it).As for the game itself, Catan offers a great balance between strategy and competitive gameplay. While luck is almost always a factor in boardgames and Catan is not the exception (dice rolling involved), the game feels more guided and affected by your strategy and decisions rather than by luck, which is good, since this makes the game more compelling and adds weight to the decisions that you make throughout the game. There is also a trading component that allows you to interact with the other players, which is great for stirring some fun arguments and debates. While this game has a competitive approach, it doesn\\'t pit the players against each others through direct confrontation (which is welcomed if you are not looking for an aggressive game where everyone ends up mad at each other), it plays more like a race in which you need to focus on your strategy while keeping watch of the opponents and overall it is extremely fun. It has simple enough mechanics for beginners, but they are also very compelling for more experienced players, specially when you start to play with the randomized board map. It is not a surprise that this is still regarded as a classic game even though it came out a long time ago.The materials and details of the cards, boards and pieces are excellent. It is worth mentioning that one of the \"settlement\" wood pieces was chipped when we opened the box. While this didn\\'t affect the use or gameplay experience and understanding that there are errors expected in manufacturing processes, we still decided to send a note to the customer service address provided by the game developers (not through Amazon) and they responded very quickly and efficiently, and within a week or so we received a replacement piece on the mail, so extra points to the customer service. Even if you are not looking to get deep into the board game community, Catan is a must if you enjoy playing games with friends or family. And even if you plan to further try more games, most likely you will always be glad to revisit this wonderful game.\\n\\n',\n",

Its like Monopoly, without the money, headaches, fighting, suspending the game, or sitting around for four hours waiting for people to make a deal. Seriously, the designers thought of everything, The map is visually pleasing, if not a bit mundane to put together. The concept of building and expanding your kingdom, often at the dismay of your neighbors will never cease to bring a smile to my face. The compressed board or cardboard pieces can take a bit of punishment  as well. This game is even great for younger kids to team up with adults so they can get in the habit of buying and selling resources and expansions. It helps with the concepts of buy and sell that young children often struggle with.\\n\\n',\n",

We played this tonight with our 4 and 6 yr old kids. We definitely had to stick with only the simple scale cards but they actually understood the concept and really enjoyed it.  The discussions were fun and the moment of reveal was super exciting.The quality of the game is very high, the plastic pieces are all thick. I was a little nervous about my kids handling it but as long as you teach them how to do it correctly it seems pretty solid. My only complaint is the score marker pieces are cardboard making them vulnerable to bending and liquids.I think playing this with a group of outgoing and fun adults would be a total blast!

       "  '\\n\\n  This is a great game. At the time of this review, I have logged 15 plays of this game.Quick summary of how the game works. You get a category that is some sort of continuum like from \"bad actor\" to \"great actor\" and then you get a secret place somewhere randomly on that range that you have to get your team to guess.  Then you have to come up with a clue that tries to get your team to guess that same place on the wheel. It\\'s really easy to think of an actor who is really great or really bad, right? But what if you need to come up with an actor who is midway between good and bad. And will your team select the same spot?1) The slidey mechanism to hide the secret spot on the wheel works great.2) This game is incredibly replayable.  There are some cards in this deck that I\\'ve remarked \"wow, you could play a whole game using just this card.3) It\\'s very easy to explain when you have the wheel in front of your to show people. If my explanation above didn\\'t make precise sense, that\\'s ok. Once you have the wheel in front of you and do an example, people get it immediately4) Surprising, the 2 player co-op version of the game is great. There are not many party games where you can say that.  How the 2 player version works is you go through 7 cards and get as many points as possible. BUT ALSO if your partner guesses the clue exactly right, you get to add another card to the deck. So it\\'s very fun to see just how high of a score you can get. We have had some terrible scores and we have had some amazing scores.This is a wonderful game and a very novel idea.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  This thing looks like a fischer price toy, and it plays like \\'Hot and Cold.\\' You want to play this game at home? It\\'s basically just this: Give everyone a card consisting of two opposing concepts, like SMALL/LARGE. Then secretly tell the cluegiver a random number on a scale of 1-20. (Let\\'s say it\\'s 17).THEN, tell the cluegiver to think of a clue that helps people guess \"17\" on the spectrum, given that one end of the spectrum corresponds to SMALL and the other corresponds to LARGE. A good clue might be \"CHRIS FARLEY\" or \"MICROSOFT,\" since both are on the high end. After the cluegiver\\'s team takes a guess, the other team can win a point if they correctly identify the first team\\'s guess as too low or high. The first team gets 4 points if they guess 17 on the dot, 2 points if they guess 16 or 18, and no points otherwise.It just ends up feeling highly arbitrary whether you nail the precise point on the spectrum or not.  You are just trying to gauge someone\\'s subjective opinion, but it\\'s so handwavy because there\\'s no real concrete information, just hunches. Is Microsoft a \"17\" or \"18\" on the SMALL/LARGE scale?  How about a 15? It\\'s large compared to most companies, but small compared to most galaxies. Who knows?  Who wants to be playing a giant game of \\'guess what was Timmy thinking when he said \"Microsoft?\" ?Unbelievable that adults are reviewing this well.  I suspect it\\'s because the designer of this made the Mind, and so there was hype behind it? Or maybe there is less shame in society now, so adults feel like it\\'s okay to indulge the latest trend even though it\\'s an elementary-school-level toy. Decrypto or Codenames are far better party games for large groups. Just One is also recommended.\\n\\n',\n",

It also comes with a black plastic tray to hold the money as well. The instructional booklet was easy to follow and the board is firm; however, it folds in four so it doesn't lay completely flat. Pennsylvania Railroad will stick up a bit and it's a hard crease on the B & O Railroad. I wouldn't advice being crafty by using super glue, because then it won't fold properly making the board even worse. It has to fold where the creases are, unless you plan on having it remain flat. This isn't the original version of Monopoly, I knew that based on the price, but the goal for me was to have family fun time. There were a few new tokens, T-Rex, the ducky, and the penguin which are fine when you're playing with children. For those adults who played the original monopoly and were used to being the horse, iron or shoe, theses tokens are NOT included.If you're looking for the tradition of the game, this is not for the version for you. (remember, the original board folded in two, this one does not) In addition, the Chance and Community Chest cards are also different in style, and the money is slightly smaller. But all in all, it is a fun game for the family. Although my family and I have played this game a few times, for many hours, and enjoyed it, I gave it four stars because of the fold and creases on the railroads and the inability to lay completely flat without assistance. But overall it serves its purpose.\\n\\n\",\n",

Also the chance and community chest cards are so few you have to reshuffle constantly to play a full game. They cut costs too much to where you constantly feel the lack of components in every manner. I would have bought an older version if it had all the parts. Instead of buying an extra stack of money and houses it was cheaper to just buy two sets.\\n\\n\",\n",

I removed this card from the set as soon as possible. The second thing is the money tray doesn't allow the money to be seated if the box is closed, so money and cards end up everywhere in the box. get some ziplock lunch bags for money and property cards and you'll be right as rain.\\n\\n\",\n",

But we were happy with the US version we got, as we've been to the states for quite a few times and the name of the streets became familiar to us.The game is very fun, both my 9 years and 12 years old kids outperformed me all the time. We've really spent some good quality family time playing together.The player pieces seemed tailored to our family, I like duck, my younger one likes penguin, my older one likes car, and my husband likes ship. So we have no fight on it.But we do feel that the player piece, the green house, the red hotel and the dice are made too small in size, it's not that comfortable to pick them up, especially my husband who has bigger hands. Also, if the seller could provide a small box to keep those small pieces safe, then we would be more satisfied. After 2 months playing, one dice, 2 player pieces and a few houses were missing and couldn't be found anywhere.For what we can tell, another stuff could be improved is the quality of the money. The paper was very thin, we kind of worried that the money could not last long.It's a good game anyway, no regrets.\\n\\n\",\n",

For one thing, mine seems to have been assembled incorrectly with the playing surface glued onto the cardboard 90 degrees off from what it should have been. This means the fold of the board will be between the Kings and the Queens as opposed to dividing the board between the opposing players. The other annoying thing about the board is that it has the brand-name \"Pressman\" printed prominently on the playing surface, which I find distracting. This is not how the board is depicted on the cover of the box.It\\'s usable and not worth returning for the money that I spent on it, but on balance I wish I had not bought it.\\n\\n',\n",

I figured it was time to try to teach my kids (daughter, 9; son, 6) how to play. They caught on very easily and it is a ton of fun, but this particular game is very cheaply made. It has two wooden dowels on either side that hold the two boards together, but aren’t really attached to anything and fall out easily, so then your boards don’t stay together while you’re playing. The wood isn’t really sanded or finished, so it’s just raw, scratchy wood. I would look elsewhere for a sturdier game that finished and will last for a long time.\\n\\n',\n",

This was just \"okay\". The board is very thin and flimsy. When we slide our checkers across the fold line, they always catch on the fold and want to flip right off the board. It looks like the board could easily rip in half. The checkers seem like they are made from thin, cheap plastic. When I first received this in the mail, the checkers were making so much noise inside the box, it sounded like broken glass. ( no, none were broken).  As it turns out, my grandbaby is quite good at this game and enjoys it. I appreciate her strategy moves and can see her analyzing each possible move. No poker face there. Not yet anyway. I probably would not recommend this checker board game to anyone looking to impress someone. It doesn\\'t look like it will last very long. But it has given us some enjoyable hours together that doesn\\'t involve TV or other electronics. Would I buy this particular set again?....no.

I love reading Amazon reviews but this was one instance where I wish I hadn't.  I struggled with the decision to purchase based on the negative reviews. Not because of the price. I was worried about the quality. I had planned to host a large dinner party for Thanksgiving and we wanted to play some classic games like Uno, Checkers, Rummy, and Pitty Pat after dinner.  I didn't want a flimsy board that wouldn't lay flat and featherweight checker peices to offer my guests. I ended up schlepping to multiple Walmarts in my area in search of a standard black and red set -- which none of them had. Had to be black and red (for nostalgia) and Walmart in my area only had the black and tan wood sets, the glass sets, or the magnetic travel set with the tiny board.

Each of the numbers fit inside a small slot and come out elegantly. All the previous versions, if you were not careful, then two or three pieces will come out. This is a big winner.2. The pieces are not simple balls but a design with a small neck and the head. This neck snaps nicely on the Bingo board, so you can see which one is populated which are not. In my previous bingo cages, you hope u never shake it. Here a small shake will not topple all the coins out of the bingo board.3. The yellow glassy markers ensures that the cards can be kept clean AND REUSED.4. The cage has a separate slot to put all the coins.Not a deal breaker but certainly nice feature.SUMMARY: On  a simple toy like Bingo, It is commendable as to the number of improvements it has got over other products available in Walmart.

It would be better if there was a way to store the beads in the board, but I have just been keeping it all in a gallon sized bag.\\n\\n',\n",

As many times, the stones were overflowing and falling into other sections. But quality seems to be good, smooth inside and stones were glass looking (maybe glass) in nice colors.\\n\\n\",\n",

I was shocked to discover there is now a version with press-on stickers, and relieved you could still buy the \"original\" with the numbers and heads of the troops molded into the plastic.But wait. For some incomprehensible reason they have reversed the numbering so the General is now 10 instead of 1, the 9 is now a 2, and the Spy is a 1 instead of an S. For someone who has played probably a hundred games with the old numbering, it\\'s near impossible to adjust.The other \"improvement\" is a folding barrier they now include which you can put up in the center of the board to hide your pieces as you are placing them. But guess what. If you are playing with a kid, inevitably they will knock this over and send your pieces flying just after you\\'ve spent 10 minutes organizing them.I would very much like to meet the person responsible for these changes so I could give them a piece of my mind. Maybe even challenge them to a game of Stratego--the REAL original version.\\n\\n',\n",

The box has a great vinyl like feel that is sure to be more rugged than most of our household games.  Many of our games have cracked or broken edges based on stacking them or just the nature of young kids.  So this was a huge plus immediately.The red and blue pieces have their own carrying case.  Just a small plastic tray with a top, but it means that the game goes back together the same way each time.  And this will prevent the playing pieces from going missing.  Another plus in my mind.The board itself is rather rugged.  There was a small tear initially upon first opening, but that was in the seam of the board and not on the playing surface.  The board is heavy and feels like it will last.The divider was my first negative mark.  3 or 4 times in the first few play throughs, the board has fallen down and knocked over our pieces.  I say set this aside and avoid the potential upset.Finally, the game itself is fun.  This is more strategy then luck.  Very simple concept, but the customization of arranging your pieces is a nice change from many other board games out there.  And the time spend creating the game play is just enough to not get boring.Overall, if you played this as a kid, or this is your first time, I would highly recommend it!\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  As a lover of the original Stratego, it was extremely frustrating to open this version and find out that the new pieces are inferior to the original in several respects.  1) the numbers are so tiny that it is impossible to see - especially the white on red.  The printing is very faint as well  2) The cheap round plastic rook like pieces are slippery and fall over easily during gameplay or get turned slightly so that they are exposed to the other player.I have no idea why this company ruined a perfectly good game piece to save just a few bucks.  What a shame.  This set is not worth owning.  Just to make it playable, I had had to print out numbers and then tape them on the pieces with clear tape.  What a huge pain!\\n\\n',\n",

We had to stop playing, I had 3/6 infinity stones and Hela was no where near accomplishing any portion of her objective. Maybe it works with more players but one on one just isn't fun.The instructions are also vague in a few cases. The worst example is Thanos' ability to attack allies in other people's realms. No where does it tell you where to put Thanos' allies. Do they go in the Hero slot? Do they go on the bottom with the other villains allies? No clue. Putting them on the top makes Thanos even more unstoppable.I'd love if the publishers read this review and somehow fixed this. I was so excited to play it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I very rarely leave reviews on products I purchase because I\\'m a bad a consumer of products, but I\\'ll make an exception for this.Villainous is a great board game that is super easy to learn with a decent skill ceiling to offer a little for everyone. That being said, for a collector the ORIGINAL sets are very high quality and great pieces for any collection. The character pieces are cast in a clear plastic with a satisfying weight to them, the game boards are a nice thick board, and the plastic well for the game pieces are in the center is a solid color plastic center piece that looks nice. MARVEL Villainous does not hold up to this standard. The character pieces are still unique models that are nice to look at, but they are light, hollow, and do not hold up to the originals. The boards do not hold up to the original with the way they fold, and the thick/quality of the board they used for it is less than the original. The center dome is a clear plastic flimsy garbage that is disgraceful compared to the original.The only things that hold up to the original so far are the new fate \"EVENTS\" that are printed on a nice thick cardboard, and the original art that is always appreciated. I do like Villainous quite a bit, but I will say that I\\'m unsure if I will collect all the additional versions of the MARVEL Villainous in the same way I collected the original Disney Villainous so far due to the change in quality of pieces. As a collector it bothers me a bit more, but in terms of a fun game I\\'d say it\\'s still great. If you like Marvel check it out, if you want a better looking set I\\'d say go for the original. Either way Villainous is one of my favorite games to play with friends because of the simplicity and how nice the set looks.EDIT: As a follow up. The game plays as good if not better than the original set. Characters feel like they ramp up in a more satisfying way and heavily interact even though things like \"condition\" cards have been removed from the decks. The single Fate deck that is drawn from is a fantastic idea that gives me \"Marvel Champions\" vibes. Thanos is one of the best designed characters, but is not new player friendly due to his seemingly infinite unique rules that aren\\'t heavily outlined in the rule book.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  My partner and I are huge fans of the Villainous series.  I personally was stoked when they announced there was going to be a Marvel version of the game.  I will say my disappointment.....was very apparent after playing a few games.The good: the villains do have a great theme to them.  Thanos and seeking out his stones, for instance, is a blast theme wise.  It is also fun to see some of my favorite Marvel personalities come into play.The bad: Whew.  Where to start.  First and foremost, this game is NOT good in a 1v1 setting.  The fate mechanic in Disney was used a bit of a catch up mechanic, which I think is missing in Marvel.  The shared fate pool is great in theory, but the execution is lacking.  Not every villain's fate cards do much to stop other villains in the same manner.  There is the added effect of drawing fate cards on your turn that can allow you to dodge the bullets that would stop you.  It's a mess.  I would have much preferred fate cards that hit everyone just as well with a kicker if assigned to a certain villain.The rules are very inconsistent and messy as well.  There are a number of interactions (see Taskmaster and Killmonger's Rook for example).  There is a need for bolding words that are actions vs using that word in a sentence later on.  Overall, you can tell that the Covid crisis really played a part in the quality control of the rules.  Plus, it seems like it is a race to see who can turbo fate their opponents, at least in 1v1, the quickest to win.  In the games I have played or watched, that is who usually wins.I really wanted to like this game as I am THE target audience for it.  As is, I will not be buying future expansions and will only be playing the game at someone else's request.  If we have too many, I will be the first to volunteer to sit out as I do not want to participate in the head scratching of rules questions.  I wish the best of luck to this line, but as is, I cannot recommend it and will actively talk my friends out of buying it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  The gameplay is fun, as always; however, there a few things that are preventing me from giving a higher rating.1. Noticeable decline in game piece quality. One thing I’ve loved about the Disney Villainous series up to this point is the creative game pieces and overall high quality of the cards, artwork, boards, etc. As soon as I opened the Marvel box, I could tell something was different. The game pieces have a metallic look and are lighter, cheaper plastic. The cards are thin and stick together more than I remember with previous expansions (highly recommend getting card sleeves). Even the character booklets feel different.2. The choice to not make it compatible with the Disney line. I’m sure since many of the mechanics are the same that someone online will figure out a good way to play with both sets, but it is a bit of a bummer that the company went that route. Disney owns both properties, so it would’ve been fun to have matchups like Ultron vs Ursula.3. Repeat cards. Seems like there are fewer unique cards in each deck (this could be a misunderstanding on my part). Not a huge deal as the new twist on the fate deck and the introduction of events keeps things interesting but it just adds to the overall sense that this was more rushed/cheaply produced than some of the others in the villainous series.Overall, if you are already a fan of the Villainous series (or Marvel), you will find plenty to enjoy in this release. The above is mostly nitpicks because I am a big fan of the series, overall. As with previous installments, there are new ideas in play that keep things fresh and engaging. I do like how players are no longer isolated in their own boards and the twist on the fate deck is a great addition.\\n\\n',\n",

That one delicate part that will always make me wary of playing it incase it rips and is destroyed beyond my repair.\\n\\n',\n",

I would have loved to have Hela go head to head with Hades, or see Ultron versus Ursula, but alas, the world will never know. They also needlessly changed certain terminology, symbology, and mechanics that does not add to the gameplay or theme.It ultimately feels like a cash grab from Disney. Take a successful game, slap a popular IP on it, and make it incompatible with the others (so people are forced to pay for essentially the same game twice).That said, this game is still fun and adds new features that take Villainous to the next level.But the downgraded components, needless terminology and mechanic changes, and incompatibility with other Villainous games take a 5-star game down to 3-stars.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  Disappointed with the game. I loved Disney Villainous and have all the expansions and assumed that the Marvel Villainous would also be of the same quality, but I was quite disappointed.Firstly, the quality of the components are a big step down compared to the disney version. The player tokens feel light and made of cheap plastic compared to Disney. See pictures.The cardboard token vault is also cheap.As for the cards themselves, the creators didn't proof read them before sending them out. There are quite a few misprints and visual errors. For example there is a Random 0 cost symbol on the power stone that should not be there. There is also a typo on Thanos’ “Taste of cosmic power” card. See pictures. There are 2 that are considered items and the third is considered an effect. Which one should it be? The texts reads more like an effect. But 2/3 are items???As for the rule book. Many of the rules are vague and left to interpretation. For example Killmonger’s “explosives” card. When and How do you “remove”. Why not just say discard?As for the balance of the game, the creators should have play tested more. It is way too easy to win with Taskmaster and Hela. There should be a way to destroy or limit the power of the “Training Dummy” or it gets too easy.Won with Taskmaster vs Ultron 3 times in around 15 minutes per game. Hela vs Ultron was competitive but also easy for Hela.All in all, I was excited about the game but feel that Ravensburger were too quick to release it and didn’t take the time needed to perfect the game as they did with Disney.\\n\\n\",\n",

The quality on this product sucked. Not only are their errors on some of the cards but the plastic character tokens looked and feel like cheap substitutes.The playing decks are made out of a paper cardboard that sticks and virtually makes the cards impossible to shuffle.We made a lot of ‘interpretations’ while playing Disney Villainous but usually could enjoy it. This Marvel version probably could have used a few more play tests before they released it.Personally I would not recommend people purchasing this at full price. The quality is miles lower than the predecessors.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  As a fan of the original Disney Villainous games, we were quite excited to try out the latest installment in the series .... only to find out this isn’t IN the series ...Marvel Villainous May share some mechanics with Disney Villainous - but it is a completely separate game that can’t be played with the other Villainous games ... something that should have been made very clear both on the packaging and web pages - but was “conveniently” left off.This game also adds levels of complexity to the Villainous games that make it, in our opinion, a lot less fun.  Part of what we loved about DV was that while each villain played a little different, the overall game was relatively easy to pick up - you didn’t have to spend a long time explaining things to new players.  MV is a lot more complex - and while some may see that as a positive, I do not.  If you’re playing with first time players, it will be very difficult to jump into the advanced rules.Finally, this game is a LOT more PvP than the DV games ... DV was mostly PvE with a small amount of PvP thrown in ... it meant players never really felt targeted even by fate actions, as they were playing against their unique win conditions.  MV is designed to put players against each other to achieve their win condition ... making this a far different experience than DV.Finally, the rules themselves are incredibly complex, and not well explained - lacking even a FAQ and expanded guide on the website.In the end it’s not a BAD game - the elements are there.  But it’s not the game we thought we were getting - not only in the lack of compatibility, but in the very play style.  Perhaps a different name should have been chosen.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Overall, I’m happy that I purchased this game, but it will not be pulled out as often as the Disney versions are in my house. I don’t have any issues with the quality of the game like prior reviewers, with one exception - the common fate deck cards are just slightly thicker than the individual villain fate decks which makes them difficult to shuffle. My concerns are primarily with the game play. To give context, my sister and I are both avid Disney Villainous fans and have played all of the expansions more times than we can count  - it’s one of our favorite games. I’m writing this review after playing every possible character combination in a 2 player game at the easy and medium levels. Here are my thoughts:1. Instructions are not clear for several game mechanics, but particularly for Ultron. There’s no guidance on how to meet his objectives and it is not intuitive. We finally figured it out by watching a play through on Ravensburgers YouTube channel and searching forums. We had to do that WAY too many times when first playing the characters. We probably would have been fairly confused and given up if we hadn’t been so well versed in Disney Villainous.2. There’s no real “match” for Thanos. Whoever plays him will likely win. The closest we’ve gotten to defeating him was during a three hour match between him and Taskmaster - and he still won.3. One game between two people took THREE HOURS!!! Granted, it was a bit of an anomaly in our experience, but this wasn’t even at the hardest level. At points, I just wanted to be defeated so we could finally end the game. We have not yet worked up the stamina for the “undying” level...and may never do so.4. On the plus side, we LOVE the concept of the common fate deck and events. Unfortunately, way too often, fate is not in our favor and we pull cards not intended for the person being fated. This makes it possible for luck to heavily influence the game - much more so than in the Disney versions.5. The objectives of each character have varying levels of interest. My sister and I both agreed on this ranking of how fun each character was to play: 1. Thanos, 2. Hela, 3. Taskmaster, 4. Kilmonger, 5. Ultron. We felt there was some “magic” missing in some of these initial characters, particularly Kilmonger and Ultron.Final note: as I said above, we don’t regret purchasing the game - it does add some unique elements to the Villainous premise that we really enjoyed. However, we would only recommend to experienced players who have already played Disney Villainous due to the vagueness of the rules. We would also recommend, to even out the characters, that the least experienced person plays Thanos. I feel like there is a lot of potential in this version of the game, and I hope Ravensburger takes player feedback into account in any additional expansions.P.S. We desperately want a Harry Potter Villainous, though we recognize the challenges in doing so with only a few options for “villains”. We have ideas on how to do so! :)\\n\\n',\n",

So, when I heard Marvel Villainous was being released, I was so excited! When it was released on Sunday, July 26th, I headed over to Target and purchased mine! I played this with my boyfriend and we had so much fun! I love that it's the same concept like the Disney versions, but has it's own twist, extra cards and different tokens! I'm really impressed. You can give allies to other players. For example, (a little spoiler alert) Thanos's infinity stones are actually given to other players and you have to get them back. In order to get it back, you have to move one of your allies to their realm. Everyone shares one fate deck which makes the game more challenging and interesting! This is a great game. If you haven't already purchased yours, I say DO IT!! You won't regret it. And then, if you don't already own the Disney versions, go get those too!I've seen other reviews, stating that these were cheaply made vs the Disney version. But, I don't believe so. The characters are made out of so much stronger plastic vs the Disney version. So, I'm not sure where everyone is complaining about that?The only funny complaint I had was that when I first opened mine, the Thanos and Hela characters were swapped from their prospective character slot. Otherwise, everything was in mint condition!Ravensburger, you amaze me! I cannot wait for a Marvel Villainous expansion pack (already) and another Disney Villainous. My favorite Disney Villainous expansion pack is the Cruella De Vil (Perfectly Wretched) due it's different completion objectives.Ravensburger, if you see this, please include villains from Tarzan, Mulan, Moana and Beauty and the Beast!\\n\\n\",\n",

But the pieces are still stylish and look great, even if they're lighter and feel cheaper than in the prior installments in the series. But after that initial shock (if you're familiar with the Disney games), I got over it very quickly. They look and work great.The gameplay itself is more complex than the Villainous games. There's more interaction between players and player boards, and the Thanos character in particular has a lot of new rules and challenges. This is a more strategic game than the prior installments. One small but significant rule change going to the Marvel game is how the Fate action is resolved. Instead of targeting an opponent and drawing from their personal Fate deck to impede their progress, players draw one Fate card from a shared deck and choose an opponent to play it against. This sounds simple, but it adds a lot to the game. The Event cards add another layer to the game, by creating an impediment to all players at once, influencing players to devote resources to resolving those cards. Arguably, this is a better game than the Disney Villainous series.More than the components, the biggest failing of this release is the rule book. I'm not an inexperienced gamer, but I had to go back to the rule book a lot during our first few games. And then I had to go to Boardgamegeek.com to find answers to questions unaddressed by the rule book. Representatives of Ravensburger, to their credit, have been active online responding to questions and feedback about the game. I was able to find answers to every question...eventually. But there are some important rules--especially regarding the complicated Thanos villain and the infinity stones--that are not addressed in the rules and really should have been.All in all, I rate this game high. It's a lot of fun, the art is fantastic, and the theme appeals to a lot of non-core gamers, which is part of the strength of the Disney Villainous series. The strategic additions to the game scratch that itch for people like me that like a deeper game, without making it too complicated for more casual players.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  Bought this last week and was so excited. Played twice last night and some aspects are great, but my biggest complaint is the vagueness of some of the cards. I had to Google a lot.Some examples, Taskmaster has a card allowing the movement of an ally to another players realm, but it did not say where to put it, or could I bring it back as an ally move. Taskmaster has a goal to get four allies to a strength of 5, and on each location on his board. When you move it to the other person's realm, it gets a +1 strength, so naturally I want to bring it back after, but had no idea if I could. We also Googled several things with Hela and Ultron. We played Hela vs Ultron (Ultron won) then Hela vs Taskmaster (Hela won), but Taskmaster would have won in one more turn.Some events aren't worth bothering with. Helicarrier prevents anyone from drawing more then three cards at a time (because that happens a lot). We both just ignored it.Overall I like the game, but the rules are too vague. The events and single fate pile of are a cool touch. Wish you could play it against Disney Villainous, because my daughter loves the Disney edition.\\n\\n\",\n",

If you see the picture provided, our infinity stone cards even stuck together, and while carefully removing them, as you can see three of the cards are SERIOUSLY damaged, one of which even had the cardboard falling off of the picture.I do hope this is a one off, and that future sets wont be made in such a cheap way or i might have to stop dumping money into this experience.\\n\\n',\n",

With that being said, this version is a bit disappointing compared to the original.  There is a very recognizable drop in quality in this set.  The sturdy, translucent acrylic molds of the original tokens have been replaced with cheap, lightweight plastic with rough mold seams and dull colors.  The game boards are noticeably thinner and flimsy, and the coin bank feels like the lid to an ICEE cup. Gameplay is solid, but i feel like the added  changes to separate it from the Disney versions were unnecessary, and compatibility with Disney versions would have been a better option.Overall i would say that while i am a bit disappointed and underwhelmed, i don't regret buying the game.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  We were introduced to Splendor by a board game obsessed friend of the family.  We enjoyed playing it with him so much that we ordered our own copy.  I'd say our board gaming preferences are somewhat refined, because thanks to this friend we've played a LOT of games, and Splendor has been one of our favorites for a long time.My husband and I will get Splendor out for a best 2 out of 3 on a Sunday afternoon.  We'll break it out to play with our two kids for family game night. (The kids request it more than we do.  They are 12 and 8.)  When we took it to play with extended family over the holidays, my sister ended up buying a copy for her family too.  My competitive and strategic brother-in-law can enjoy plotting and trying to spy out what everyone else is doing, while my fun-loving, chatty sister-in-law can also enjoy the same game and still have a chance to win.Replayability is high with 2, 3 or 4 players.  The pieces are nice quality and ours aren't showing much wear despite it being the most popular game in our rotation for a couple of years.  Our friend took it with him overseas on an extended business trip.  It's fairly compact if you take everything out of the box and put it in a baggy.  Another thing I like about it is no one has ever ended up with hard feelings at the end, which happens sometimes with some of our other games where players are making verbal agreements or even working as a team.You can put as much or as little thought into each turn as you want, but in the end you are choosing between 3 actions:  buying a card, reserving a card, or taking chips.  This makes it easy for a new player to get the hang of it.Last, I'll add that it's extremely well balanced.  It's a numbers game where your choices in the early turns have a noticeable effect on your later game.  None of the cards are over-powered, I've seen lots of different strategies earn the win.  It's a great game and I'd definitely recommend it!\\n\\n\",\n",

My wife and I love it from the beginning and play it with kids 9 and 10 years old who both easily grasp it and unfortunately beat the pants off the parents.  My wife has won once and I have been shut out over the course of maybe 10+ games.  It's a credit to the game that I still like it even though I haven't won yet.  My youngest has won quite a few times so strange that with all my life experience I still can't muster a win, maybe it's better to be young and just keep strategy simple.  Very pleased with the game, quality, easy of learning.  The one thing that was a little clunky was the first few games everyone was hoarding jewels which makes the game very slow but later on we realized that that was not the right strategy and there many other ways to move the game forward.Game quickly shooting to the top of the family favorites.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Fantastic game! This game is very accessible and easy to learn. We have introduced this game to about five or six other couples (at least half enjoyed the game so much that they also now own it). Typically, after a brief explanation, we play through the game once. By the second play through, new players are comfortable and able to try out their own strategies. The play time is fairly quick which is another benefit and allows more than one play in a game night. This speeds up the learning curve greatly.However simply the game is to learn, there are plenty of strategies to play with and interesting dynamics that force players to make adjustments to their plans. For example, the available economic resources are adjusted depending on the number of players, this means that if someone is hoarding a resource, diamonds for example, other players will not be able to get any more diamonds and may have to purchase cards other than cards that cost diamonds. Conversely, by hoarding those diamonds, the hoarder may slow his/her own progress in the game. The level of thought that comes into this game is often evidenced by near silence in the room; players are so engaged in their efforts that they forget to talk. Our groups, who are typically quite chatty, will often get laughs at how intense each person is.My final thought is a slight disappointment with the change in components. I have purchased two copies of the game. The first one had really heavy coins that felt good in your hands and spoke of quality to the user. The new version has lighter coins but perhaps more vibrant cards. A balance of the two copies would be preferred.\\n\\n',\n",

I think that's a mark of a good game.  And...the play structure is such that you can make the better players play to higher points, thus evening the field.  Though the rules don't suggest it, try having everyone play to 21 points sometimes.  It changes your strategy.-And though this isn't my most important concern...it's visually a very pretty game.LOVE IT!\\n\\n\",\n",

In my experience there are two main ways to win: rushing the high point cards to end the game as soon as possible, or holding out slightly longer to establish an economy base for yourself with zero-point cards, attempting to overtake those using the first strategy at the last second before they can end the game.  As a result I would say this is a good way to start off a board game night, but won't hold a candle to something like Puerto Rico.The copy I received had a pretty banged up box, as if it had been dropped on the floor and suffered water damage.

It's quick to play, easy to learn, and balances well strategy/engine building/luck. The cards are good quality, and the chips are fantastic quality (so much fun to play with if you're fidgety like me!). The rules are easy enough to understand from the rule book, but we found learning this game was easier watching a quick video online. Once one of us understood how it worked, teaching it to others has been easy. It's one they pull out for friends or family anytime games are mentioned. While only for 4 players (unless you follow some readily-available-online-5-player-variants), it works great with 2 or 3 as well. The game definitely shifts some dynamics based on how many are playing, which enhances its replayability factor. For kids or adults, or any combination of both, this is a must-have if you like board games!\\n\\n\",\n",

We tend to like games that are fun for both of us but not confrontational enough that someone feels bad when they lose.  We also don't like games that are super long and heavy.This game is perfect for us.  In fact, it might be the best game we own.  It's quick, fun, economic, has a little bit of interaction, and the build quality is excellent.  If I could only keep a handful of my games this would definitely be one of them.The only issue I have is that it's really easy to get enough points to end the game and you don't realize it.  You just play along and then both of you count your points and realize the game was over a long time ago.Other games that have a similar feel: Targi, Jaipur, Ticket To Ride Nordic, maybe Rivals for Catan.\\n\\n\",\n",

I needed another turn after this one to get the last ruby I needed for my collection I knew a noble wanted to see.  Her patronage would give me the points I needed to win.  But if I didn\\'t block my opponent, he\\'d win.  How close are the others?  The next guy is probably in the same boat I\\'m in.  Then I can\\'t... maybe the guy I block will block the other guy.  \"If I can\\'t have her no man shall\"  I remembered the scene from LadyHawke before the wicked bishop of Aquila got his.  Hmmm...  Which am I?  the bishop or the former captain of the guard?  What am I thinking?  I\\'m a Jeweler! trying to make my way in the world.This is the only trouble with this often tense game.  You can see what people are planning, you are hatching plans of your own, but don\\'t think much at all about the theme of the game.GAME PLAYYou start by picking up three different colored substantive poker chips- with pictured of various colored jewels.  or you can take two of the same color, if there\\'s enough remaining after you take them.  Then you use these to pay the price for a card.  A card may cost two blues and a red and a green or four whites.  I mean they may cost rubies, diamonds, emeralds, etc. Each card you buy has a picture of a stone in the top right corner that acts like a poker chip of that color to be used in conjunction with the chips in the future.  Except that cards don\\'t get returned to the supply.  Some cards also have point values associated with them.  There are three tiers of cards.  Good, better and best ones.  The best always have points.  Better often do, but have less.  The good ones seldom have a single point.  Whoever makes 15 or more points first triggers the game end.  Anyone needing last ups gets their... last ups and the final score is tallied.There are certain nobles laid out that look for certain card combinations.  The first to have three blues, three whites, and three reds cards gets to claim the noble.  So you are racing for those too.  One can win by ignoring the nobles and holding out for point scoring cards, so there is a little bit in the way of multiple paths to victory.One other thing you can do on your turn is take a wild stone and pull one of the cards from the supply that only you can buy later in the game.  This is usually used to stick it to another player.  Taking what they had finally saved up for.  However, it could be used to get the last red that you need but can\\'t have since all the red poker chips are in the hands of other players.The trouble with sticking it to someone is that it takes your turn to do it.  While one guy did that to me to help his fiancee win the game, it was very tender, yes, but his game suffered for it.  I may have done some heavy trash talking and deserved to be ganged up on, but I digress.  And yes, I realize relationships are important, and we even buy crazy expensive jewels to show just how important they are to us...THEMEWhich brings us back to Splendor.  The first tier of cards features in repetitive, but beautiful, artwork for where the raw stone featured in the top right is originally harvested from.  The second tier of cards shows the people who prepare the stones.  The third tier is where they might be brought to market.But cards from every tier act the same, as far as game play is concerned.  Maybe the game could be re-themed as an automobile making game and the high tiered cards would require specific components made from lower tiers...  All that to say the theme feels weak to me.BALANCEIt does feel balanced at the very beginning.  Whoever goes first gets the first shot at buying the cheap cards, but after two rounds, everyone is into the groove and facing the same challenges of having the cards they want purchased by everyone else.DOWNTIMEYou\\'ve got to wait your turn, and people can pause to reflect on what they should do because someone just took the card they want.INTERACTIONNot much required by this game.  The resources to buy with and to be bought are fairly limited, so more tension is at the beginning.  The stakes get higher as the game progressesFOR MYSELFI love how easy it is to teach others.  I bought if after being blocked from winning, and others have bought it after I taught it to them.  There\\'s lots to love, just not the theme.  My four year old loves to play this game with her older siblings.  It\\'s a winner.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  My friends simply can not get enough of this game.  I was first introduced to it in Australia & after months of being away decided to purchase it on Amazon.  The price definitely seems to fluctuate on it, so keep an eye out.Essentially you\\'re a gem lord building an empire of mining facilities.  You pay gems to purchase these mining facilities.  Each mining facility then counts as a one-discount of that type of gem each time you purchase something in the future.  As you build up your infastructure (or engine), you can purchase more expensive cards & points. First to 15 points wins!Each turn you can do one of three things:1) take gems from the bank. Three different types (1 ruby, 1 emerald, 1 sapphire for example) or 2 of the same (2 sapphires or 2 rubies) Note: there must be 2 gems remaining in the pile if you do the 2 of a kind option. Ex. there are 4 sapphires in the bank so you could take 2 sapphires. Ex2. there are 3 emeralds in the bank, you cannot take 2 emeralds because this would leave less than 2 remaining in the bank.2) purchase a card (mining facility) by paying the cost at the bottom of the card3) reserve a face-up card on the board. You take it and can purchase it on a later turn instead of taking your regular turn. You also take a gold gem which is used as a \"wildcard\" gem in lieu of any gem requirement.Watch your opponents & predict what they\\'ll do!Ease of learning: takes me 5-10min to explain the gameGameplay: quick.  People take turns rather quicklySkill: both novices and experts can play.  The game is highly dependent on what the other players do in the game.  The 2-player version involves the most \"skill\" as it\\'s mono-e-monoBuild quality:  high. Smooth, nicely weighted gem tokens & colorful, easy-to-understand cards\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nFrom a 2-player perspective\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n  The game is simple, collect enough points to win. The strategy is ever evolving, collect what you need, while obstructing your opponent from gathering what they need.Since purchasing Splendor, my wife requests to play it most nights.  It\\'s easy to set up and 2-player games can be had in 20 minutes or so.  We play it often enough that we have yet to put it with the other games, it just remains on the table day after day.  I\\'m not saying you will get that much play out of it, but finding a game that plays well as at 2-player can be tricky sometimes.Game play is simple, you do one of the following actions: take gem tokens (2 of the same color if 2 will also remain, or 3 of any 3 different colors), purchase a card, reserve a card and take a gold token (wild), or pay for a card previously reserved.  The general idea is to purchase enough lower level cards (they have color coded gems on them too) to be able to purchase upper level cards later on.  When purchasing, you give the bank back all token chips you use, but not the cards you use to make the purchase.  So if you end up with one of each 5 types (Onyx, Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire) and another card comes up that requires one token of each color, you have the ability to pay nothing for the card and place it in your pile.Reserving a card is what I really enjoy about the game.  If you are just one token shy of building the card you want or you think your opponent may want (or really need) a specific card, you can reserve it.  Take the card, place it face down and take a gold token.  On a later turn, when you have satisfied the cost of the card, you can pay the price and place that card in your inventory. The reservation of a card is limited to three (3) cards in reserve at any given time.  This can be a useful strategy when trying to thwart your opponent because they may build the card they need to achieve a \"Noble\" card.Noble cards are placed at the top of the card draw area.  The number of nobles is always the number of players plus one.  Each noble is worth 3 points.  So for a 2 player game, 9 points is sitting up there for the taking.  Each noble has a requirement that must be satisfied before it can be won.  These goals are in the number and type of specific cards you have acquired (such as 3-ruby cards, 3-onyx cards, and 3-diamond cards).  If your opponent is only 1 card away from a noble and you are trying to achieve the same one, you can reserve the card they need, and on your next turn try and build the card you need to win it.Overall, we typically play 3 rounds before my eyes hurt from studying the requirements of all the cards and my brain refuses to take any more (a little more than an hour).  At that point, I call it quits (until the next night).We have owned the game for 11 days now and have played it on 9 nights. I\\'ve got to find another 2-player game before we burn ourselves out.\\n\\n',\n",

It can play as slow or as fast as the players want, offers challenges for various skill levels, and is otherwise just plain enjoyable!  Other reviews have covered that well enough, so I\\'ll just leave it with two little add-ons: I think that despite the age recommendation of 10+, a clever six-to-eight year old could handle the game well enough (or with a little help), and our games run closer to 45 minutes to an hour--but Dad and I are pretty competitive and like to really analyze our moves.My parents, who are in their 70s and for whom I originally purchased the game, weren\\'t originally enthused about learning it.  After we got a few games in, though, they found that they enjoyed Splendor enough that they had me order another for them to give as a gift.  We now play Splendor a couple times a week whenever they are in town and they\\'re now teaching my nephews how to play!I do have one minor complaint about the game though.  My parents have some vision issues, and it\\'s sometimes difficult for them to distinguish between the colors on the cards from where they sit around the table.  The gem requirement graphics shown on the cards are oriented in different ways and do have different shapes, so that helps.  We keep the play area down by them, but sometimes they still have to ask about the requirements for a card or noble.All that being said, after Space Cowboys (the original publisher) was purchased by Asmodee there have been some quality issues (or at least changes).  The copy my parents ordered was SO MUCH LIGHTER than their copy that my father weighed it and compared it against theirs.  He then insisted on opening it beforehand to make sure everything was actually in the box (it was).  But the gemstone chips were only about 2/3 the weight of the other set.  That was only copy (1 out of 6) that was like that, but it at least partially lines up with what others have said.  Both those boxes were the same \"Golden Geek\" marked boxes,however, so that\\'s not a guarantee of the quality of the components.

The rules are only two pages and the game can be explained to anyone in less than ten minutes. I have introduced this game to all different kinds of people and it is fast becoming a Saturday night staple. It has just the right mixture of length and complexity. The amazing thing is what happens to everyone around the table once the game gets going: All conversations come to a halt. Everyone stares intently at the cards plotting their next move. We have all played this game several times and everyone agrees that there is no one real strategy. A tactic that worked in one game will fail in the next game. This is a credit to the designer. The only real strategy is to get your \"engine building\" effect going as fast as possible and race everybody else to the end. Another nice benefit is the fact that this game plays as well with 2 players as it does with 3 or 4. But since nobody talks during this game, it doesn\\'t really matter!\\n\\n',\n",

The strategy is pretty clear for anyone who has played an engine building game before, but anyone who isn't as experienced with board games will pick it up after one playthrough.The game itself has a good amount of strategy for how simple it is, as the order of cards and the different nobles changes each time. Over the course of the game you'll need to adapt to what your opponents are doing and which cards are coming up, changing your strategy based on the available options. There is also a mechanic that allows you to reserve one of the cards on the table, which is a great boost to the competitive element - though it sucks when someone takes the card you've been building to off the table!Splendor is a fun, fast-paced game that is pretty quick to pick up despite having a decent amount of strategy.

Only 4 stars because, as many other reviewers have mentioned, there are many haunts that are lacking details that can make the gameplay rather confusing.My main issue related to this game is the quality of the game and pieces. All of the small monster/item/etc token pieces require you to punch out the pieces from a large sheet. A large portion of my pieces ripped and tore when punching them out. Additionally, a room tile and character card have some small tears on them. The characters are all made of cheap plastic. One of them was not set properly and leans so much it barely stands up. I have some friends that own an older version of the game and it is of much higher quality than the game I received. I should also mention that the actual game box has started peeling. I have only had this game for 2 weeks now and it already looks like its been heavily played for years.I do want to mention that I reached out to Avalon Hill about the torn game pieces and they are sending me replacement pieces. The customer service was great, but the actual replacement parts are going to take 5-6 weeks to ship to me. It's rather disappointing for a new game that is rather expensive to buy. I expected higher quality. I can only hope that the replacement pieces are better than the originals that I received.Gameplay - 4/5 starsGame Quality - 1/5 starsAvg Rating - 3/5 stars\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  Betrayal is one of my top favorite board games that I'm constantly trying to get my friends to play. It's a fun, challenging game that's really enjoyable with the right group of people.It's an exploration/board building game with an eerie theme about it and a really unique mechanic.Players begin by choosing a character -- one of 12, each of which have their own set of stats. Then players enter the house, flipping cards to uncover rooms to build out the mansion. Rooms can contain special events, items (like weapons, armor, or occult paraphernalia), or omens. Which are bad.Whenever an omen is found, the player that found it must roll the die and roll more than the number of omens that have currently been found. If a player fails to roll more than the number of omens, then THE HAUNT BEGINS. At this point, the instruction book is consulted which will tell you which haunt scenario to follow based on the conditions that caused it to occur. Usually one player is named the betrayer and is given their on set of instructions to follow (I suggest you make them leave the room) while the rest of the explorers plan their strategy to defeat them.There are around 30 different scenarios you can play out, which means that you can play several different unique stories. The flavor text of all the cards is pretty entertaining, so things are best if everyone can get into it when they're reading to the group.Overall it's a really fun game that can be enjoyed by both seasoned board gamers and beginners.\\n\\n\",\n",

This began when the children were little and has remained a fun family tradition into the children’s 20’s.As with anything the games have evolved from CandyLand to Risk, Axis and Allies and now this.We have already played it three times and enjoy it every time.Pros: The concept is great, it’s enganging , unique board design, high variety of outcomes , the cooperative concept can change to player VS player changing the dynamic and creating quantifiable fun, it can be a long or short game depending on the variables and it covers our need to include all of our age groups for entertainment value.Cons: Being the “monster “  can be confusing as the literature (instruction book) is not written for beginners, although variable scenarios are possible it can quickly become familiar leaving the surprise aspect absent, limited card selection (we are already buying the additional pack at roughly $19.00)  so this could be intentional as a way to upsell the product. (Brilliant marketing strategy)As a tool in our parental tool box to combat the digital age and losing touch with our children on a very personal level this is a great addition and will be played for many years.Other facts to know:The players build the game board as they go and this can demand a large playing area.Game cards will scratch if played on a rough surface. We play on a stone dining table and this has occurred.The “monster scenarios” are all different and in our expierence thus far - it appears everyone wants to be the monster.It costs less to buy this than the amount you would spend to take the whole family to one movie, you could play this for many evenings.Enjoy and “game on”!\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  This game is a lot of fun, but it is hard to learn. The directions can be somewhat confusing-especially if you are new to the game. It is so much easier to have someone who knows how to play to explain it to you as you go! I\\'ll do a quick synopsis to demonstrate:One of the difficult parts to learn was what \"The Haunt\" and \"Monster Roll\" was. The haunt is basically where the game changes.The monster roll is the turn of the monster (whatever monster is activated) during the haunt.Basically, you & your group enter a haunted house. Roll the dice to see how many rooms/steps you take. You start off with just the entryway-you \"discover\" rooms as you go. This means you grab a board piece that corresponds to whatever floor you are on and add it to the board where you are.Once you enter a room, some will have a symbol on the room & it will direct you to pick up a card & read/follow the directions on it.It\\'s best to discover as many rooms as possible before the haunt is activated. *The haunt is activated by a dice roll.During the haunt: One person will take on an extra role of being the monster. The other players will try to defeat the monster.See? Not too hard, but unless you read the whole booklet very carefully, you might not understand fully.  It took 3 of us fumbling thru one game, then kinda knowing what we were doing during the second. Then we some-what mastered it on the 3rd round.It is ok with just 3 players, but way more fun with 4 or more!It has a great re-play ability to it. Each time things will change-rooms, monsters, items you have, etc.Overall, this is a great game. It has a learning curve in the beginning, but you can catch on quickly after that. Like I said, having at least one person to help the others walk thru it, makes it way more fun & easy to learn! It\\'s not a quick game-if you take your time & especially if you are new, it will take at least an hour to play!We paid $31 + tax for it and it was worth it. Hopefully, they will make a new addition with easier to understand directions. I\\'d also like to see it take longer to activate the haunt. It is fun exploring the rooms & lots of times we only have a few before the haunt!\\n\\n',\n",

It's really not that hard, and is a lot of fun. My 11-yr-old daughter can't get enough of it, and takes the betrayal very seriously. The first part of the game is easy: Just move through the house, exploring tiles and experiences minor challenges. Then the Haunt is revealed: One of 50 Random stories. Each of these plays like a slightly different game using the same rules as the first part. It's a lot of fun, and challenging.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  We\\'ve had a LOT of fun with this game. Mechanics are pretty simple: you pick a character and \"explore\" an old house, by going through doorways to reveal new rooms. You then pick a new room tile from the stack of tiles and lay it out, connecting it to the doorway you just passed through. Most rooms have either an event, an item, or an omen in them. If so, your turn ends and you collect an event or item or omen card. These cards are fun and sometimes you get benefits, sometimes bad things happen to you.Eventually, once enough omen cards have been selected, something called \"the haunt\" begins. At that point one of the players turns traitor! He or she then goes off and reads the haunt instructions from a booklet, while the remaining players read different haunt instructions from another booklet. Both players and traitor get instructions on how to win the game. This is totally cool. Sometimes your foe is a ghost, sometimes a mummy, sometimes it\\'s the house itself seemingly come to life! The clock starts ticking then, as you have a certain number of turns to win by.Just remember one thing: the rules are there to help, not to drive you nuts. If something is unclear you can ask in many online places (including here on Amazon) but remember to keep playing even when confused about a rule. Decide what you think the rule means and go for it! If you later on find out that you didn\\'t do the rule correctly, just play it \"right\" the next time. Or stick to your own interpretation. It\\'s a game, and it\\'s FUN.

       "  '\\nFun and Variable for Experienced Gamers, but a Little Complicated and Creepy for Beginners or Kids\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n  Let\\'s start with THE GOOD NEWS: I\\'m personally a big fan of this game! It\\'s basically like putting yourself in the middle of every horror movie you\\'ve ever seen or heard about. If you like horror movies, then you\\'ll like this game! If not, probably give it a pass. I\\'m a pretty experienced board-gamer and like many aspects of its gameplay, especially the many ways in which the game is almost never the same each time you play it (see details below.) However, Betrayal is also a very detailed and complicated game that I wouldn\\'t necessarily recommend for beginning gamers or children. Here are some highlights:GAME DESCRIPTION: As I mentioned above, the game essentially places players into the middle of every horror movie that\\'s ever been written. The game has two phases: 1- Exploring the House, and 2- The Haunt. At first, everyone works together while you play as a band of assorted characters who are exploring your way through a haunted house, revealing haunted room after haunted room. While exploring the house, players collect artifacts that make them stronger. Eventually, however, one player stumbles across an item that triggers the second phase, The Haunt. During the Haunt, you\\'re trying to deal with whatever monster/spirit/other horrifying problem emerges to haunt the house (there are 50 different Haunts to play in the game, depending on how exactly The Haunt is triggered). Often, the player that triggers the haunt turns on the other players (i.e., becoming a werewolf or something) and the other players need to either band together to bring them down or be destroyed. The game ends when either \"the haunter\" or \"the haunted\" complete the task assigned to them in The Haunt!VERY FUN FOR EXPERIENCED GAMERS: In my opinion the best part of Betrayal is the HUGE variability it contains. Every single aspect of the game changes from one round to another: you can choose different starting characters each time (who come equipped with different abilities [strength, speed, etc.]), the haunted house is never the same twice since you reveal rooms from a shuffled stack piece-by-piece, you discover different items each time, and the huge selection of Haunts makes it so that you almost never have to replay them (I\\'ve played this game many times, and have yet to repeat Haunts)! Also, the game is made all the more fun because of its immersive, creepy vibe. There are some Haunts that I like more than others, but the feeling of being stuck in a horror movie with your fellow players is pretty pervasive and entertaining. You\\'ll love it!NOT FOR BEGINNER GAMERS: As fun as this game is, I wouldn\\'t necessarily recommend it to beginner gamers. The game is very complicated, and takes a close reading and re-reading of the rules to play it right. Also, it has lots of fiddly little pieces that, if lost, can really disrupt gameplay. My biggest complaint about the game is that the rules for The Haunt aren\\'t always clear, and you kind of have to decide as a group what the \"rules of engagement are\" in situations where disagreements arise. This is exacerbated by the fact that only The Haunter is allowed to read their instructions, while The Haunted read their own. If you are a beginning player and want to give this a try, I recommend you find someone who already knows how to play and have them walk you through it. Or do a video tutorial!NOT NECESSARILY FOR CHILDREN: Finally, because of the horror-based foundation of the game, I wouldn\\'t recommend it for children. Some of The Haunts are pretty creepy, and I wouldn\\'t want to be responsible for recommending anything that might cause nightmares! I\\'d say that the game creators\\' recommendation of \"Ages 12+\" is appropriate.Bottom line: I\\'ll return to play this game many, many more times in the future, and hope that you\\'ll enjoy playing it too. Happy haunting!\\n\\n',\n",

I do some tabletop roleplaying and things like that, and I like board games. My family are not roleplayers, but they like board games.

There are lots of different pieces and chips and all of that sort of thing. However, there\\'s a good guide on Youtube that helps understand things a lot quicker, and with that and a quick trial game, you should be good to go.Everyone enjoyed this game. My sister does not like board games, and we got her to play it multiple times in one night. My brother and his girlfriend wanted to get their own copy to play at home. The roleplaying elements are as light or heavy as you want to make them, so it\\'s an easy, accessible game for your more \\'normie\\' gamers.My dad loves board games and he often has a hard time getting anyone else to play with him. That was not a problem with House on the Hill. Four games in one night, and \"a near-perfect day\" for my dad means this gets 5 stars from me.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  I am happy to report that quality of construction issues many reviewers reported have been fixed. So that\\'s a plus. But here are some things I learned from playing this game the first time with my family.1) the rulebook is an encyclopedia smeared with mud - metaphorically of course. But it is thick and obscure and honestly leaves you with more questions than answers.2) there are LOTS of dice but no clear indication of how many to roll.  So we decided that when it say 4+ it meant roll 4 dice.  No clue if this is right but it was just a way to move forward and stop flipping through the book.3)before the haunt - the only point is to collect cards and earn skills. That\\'s it. So don\\'t put too much thought into that part. Just collect cards and build skills or you will die almost immediately after the haunt.4) the Monsters- good grief could the actual directions be any less clear about this?  What we think is that different haunts use different monsters and the traitor will be given the directions as to what monster and how.  Our particular haunt had no monsters which caused us to constantly be questioning why we weren\\'t using them and our traitor was  really frustrated because the haunt scenario didn\\'t mention them so we had no idea.5) there is stuff in the box you may not use - they put tons of stuff in there because some haunts need x and others need y so you have x and y in the box. Don\\'t let it confuse/frustrate you. This of course is my theory based on our one experience - which was extremely confusing and frustrating.6)when you become a master player the game may take an hour....but for the rest of us - it takes MUCH much longer. Most of which is spent reading rules and trying to interpret them.7) the item cards are things you can use when you attack or battle things later.  I have no idea about these because we fumbled our way through the haunt which seemed random so we never actually used our items and only had a couple of attacks because we really had no idea what we were doing.  We couldn\\'t understand the nomenclature enough to strategize nor did we know what they were talking about....for example, \"add 2 if you have the madman in the library and the music book and someone has the music skill\"  Um.....what madman?  What music book? Does the someone with the music skill need to be the one rolling the dice or is it any member of the team? What if two members have the skills, do we get double the points?  Turns out - some of these are cards or chits you may earn. So when you read things you don\\'t understand - assume they are cards/chits you will eventually find.  That does of course make strategizing harder.  Some of it you just have to make house rules for. So we decided any person on team could have the skill and if more than one had it we got double the points.  Who knows if we are right but it at least ended the debate and moved us forward.8) give up trying to figure out the rules and make your own where there is conflict/confusion (which is often). You will have a better experience if you just make a decision and move on rather than spend an hour flipping through the book only to not find what you need. Trust me on this one.  Flip a coin, accept the decision and move on. Or you will all be miserable.9) there are YouTube videos.  Seriously! Watch one before attempting this game, it will really help you at least have a clue what you are doing.10) several reviewers say you need to play 3 times before deciding what you really think. I am going to trust them because I really wanted to like it but found it a quagmire of confusion and frustration. So we are going to attempt it again (after watching the YouTube video).Honestly, after the first time through I actually threw the game to name the traitor the winner because I just wanted it to be over. I boxed the game up and planned to give it to Goodwill. I logged in to write a review and instead read lots and lots of other reviews and then decided to give it another try not worrying so much about \"the rules\" and just going with the gist of the idea - which makes for a MUCH better experience.  I\\'ll let you know how that goes.  If it fails - I am burning this stupid game.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  I love the idea of this game. I have no issue with the material or tokens or anything other than the apparent lack of playtesting of the haunts. One minor problem is that most haunts seem to clearly favor the traitor or the heroes and it's demoralizing when it's pretty apparent very soon after the haunt is revealed which side is going to win.The bigger problem, however, is that most of the haunts are not written well. The haunt-specific rules are often unclear and ambiguous and the many resulting questions quickly bring the game to a frustrating and screeching halt, especially if the traitor is a player new to the game. I would urge the publisher to review all of the haunts, playtest them properly and publish more detailed haunt explanations online to make the game much more enjoyable.\\n\\n\",\n",

I read through all the rules, watched a YouTube video to help with set up, and was ready to sit down and figure out the many elements of the game we supposed would make it fun. We were enjoying the board set up and building the house, but as soon as we got to “the haunt”, we closed the booklets and threw the game away. The game has extremely dark content not suitable for family play and not advisable for any age. If we are going to spend four hours of our time as a family playing a game, it will not be one so demented and morally dubious.\\n\\n',\n",

(Not just cute halloween, but definitely haunted house) The idea of having many different outcomes, a board that slowly unfolds, or characters that can change sides is great! but the first play is VERY long. It may be worth youtubing to learn gameplay.Especially if you end up being the traitor in the group... you essentially get an additional booklet of instructions/rules that you need to play as the bad guy, and others involved in the game can't help you too much, or you lose strategy. If you're not a more experienced board gamer, or at least ready to do lots of reading, this may be too much for you or your friends.That being said, after you learn how the game basically operates, it may become easier the next time you play?The only thing I would say is that there were sometimes we as a group really had to search through the manuals (yes there is multiple) to figure out how to do certain parts of gameplay...I.e. how many times can I actually do damage to this monster in one turn?If that could be made clearer and simpler, it would really go far.Note: I do not have the updates to the game people in the comments are talking about, like the player boards etc.\\n\\n\",\n",

Here's my overall impression of the game.**Gameplay: 5 stars**We all have a blast playing the game! Just when the exploring starts to become dull, the game switches to a survival game where anything can happen. The random unpredictability keeps all of us on our toes.**Board Pieces: 4 stars**The board pieces aren't warped yet for our game, and I hope it never happens. The artwork is great and the sliding counters fit perfectly. The cards are high quality and fun.**Figurines: 2 stars**These were the biggest disappointments for me. They are very low quality and the faces look warped and inhuman. It was hard for us to distinguish a few pieces apart because of their low quality. If I had a collection of other figurines, I'd be very tempted to use them.**Instruction Manual: 3 stars**Although they did a good job trying to explain the gameplay for a quirky, random game like this, our group was left with almost as many questions as we had answers. We looked up as much as we could, even searched online, but in the end had to come up with some reasonable house rules.**Replay-ability: 5 stars**The random nature of the game means you'll be playing it a lot!As I said before, this game has got it where it counts. Even though it's not a perfect game by any means, it is so much fun I forgive it for its faults. Get it, play it a few times, enjoy it. That's what gaming is all about.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Let me start by saying that this is a 2/5 as opposed to a 5/5 for the pieces received and customer service received, NOT for the game itself. I highly recommend this game to any board game collector or player that wants co-op tabletop and group play.The reason I marked low on my review is because of the game figurines we received with the purchase. While the materials are acceptable I received 2 of the same figure (the little girl in yellow) and was missing the little boy figure from the game. Not unusable...then I unwrapped them and noticed 3 of the 6 pieces were horribly leaning, and while they did manage to balance upright the appearance they give is not of the highest quality. Before writing this review I contacted Wizards of the Coast hoping they could at least replace the missing figurine and I could leave a proper review and show the replacement piece...unfortunately the piece we received was not at all close to the character in the game, nor does it look like it belongs in the same set of figurines. While this game is not unplayable by any means, having pieces that match are what make a game feel complete. The service I received from Wizards of the Coast has, in the past, always been great. This time, unfortunately, I received an automated reply telling me they would send a replacement piece and then received this (image 3).I am sad to leave a less than deserved review because I have been a fan of WotC products and this is the first time I have had a real complaint with them. However, after seeing that these pieces are a recurring issue with this game I am surprised that they have not re-cast pieces, or at least ensured that the sets are properly packaged/assembled before sealing and shipping.I hope future products and purchases are of the standard I usually see from this company.\\n\\n',\n",

Now they're the sort to fight and scream in a way that kinda ruins a game, even with other really fun tabletop games. I'm all for getting loud and having banter in a game, but not in a way that leaves half of the group feeling exhausted and thinking that they didn't have fun. Surprisingly, that didn't happen with this game. They were all engaged and enjoying themselves. If one of them got too rowdy, the others were quick to calm them down because they were all having a good time. Played it with them on other occasions, and since they understood how to play, it only went more smoothly.

You can buy an organizer for $30, but that's something the game should come with, not something I have to pay for.  Need the smoke token?  Ok, give me 5 minutes to sort through the pile of tokens to find it.  And there are games where you'll need multiple tokens too.  I really just wish this was better organized.  Also, the character cards suck, but there are plenty of third party apps for tracking characters that make it easier to deal with.  This game is so close to being 5 stars, but it's just missing so many little basic things that it really shouldn't that I even honestly struggle to give it a 4 star.

It is a unique cooperative game, unless you become the traitor the it is a unique game where you massacre your friends and laugh at them. This game comes with 50 different scenarios and I have still yet to play them all. The first play through takes a little bit of extra time to get the basic rules down but then runs smoother after you have a game under your belt. It usually takes an hour per play through. My friends ask to play this all the time.Even though this is one of my favorites, I docked it a star because the rules can be confusing on each scenario. Some are straight forward while other scenarios are poorly written. It can take quite a while to figure out your objective whether you’re the heroes or the traitor. Even though I have played this a ton, I still play with the rules right next to me so I can figure things out. Finally, my last knock on this game is the plastic character trait tabs are too big for the cards. They don’t hold their position well so it is easy to mess up what your traits are.Overall, despite this game being confusing at points it is a rare must have if you like to play games in groups of people. I have played this with my family (including parents that don’t understand strategy games) and with my nerdy friends who play tons of strategy games. Everyone loves it.\\n\\n',\n",

I was blown away. The game does have some issues, but overall it is fun and engaging. There aren't a ton of actions per turn and play seems to move quickly until you get to the haunt. Once at the haunt, the game does slow considerably as you try to figure out what the new rules for the game are.Some minor quibbles- the rules are ambiguous at times, especially during the haunt. There is help online, if needed. The suggested age is the first place where I could say that you should listen to it. Younger players could play fin up to the haunt, but once the haunt begins, that falls away. A lot of responsibility and intuition falls to the traitor to figure out their part. if they are too young or just can't get things normally, then the haunt will fall apart. One of my 12 year olds just couldn't grasp the intricacies of the haunt and we eventually just gave up that scenario.\\n\\n\",\n",

I wouldn\\'t recommend it for beginners, as there are a lot of mechanics and possibilities and the way you play the game can change in a moment. But for friends and families who like to play board games pretty often, Betrayal is a perfect way to shake things up.I think I\\'d compare it to the game Mansions of Madness, except Betrayal is a lot easier to understand and faster to play.I think its best feature is that it\\'s a really dynamic game and everything is designed so that you can play over and over again and still get a totally different experience every time. For example, you and your friends explore the titular house on the hill by placing room tiles as you encounter them, so the map will always look wildly different with each session. This base game also comes with dozens of story scenarios that are triggered randomly by play, and each scenario is adaptable so that the \"traitor\" can be a different player every time or even that there can be no traitor at all, meaning you never know who is suddenly going to turn on the rest of the group after you\\'ve just spent the first half of the game trusting (and giving weapons to--uh oh!) each other.\\n\\n',\n",

Eventually the haunt will start, and then things get crazy. Someone becomes a traitor, and they leave to read their traitor rules while the good guys read their new rules. There are 50 separate haunt scenarios possible. They are chosen depending on the 'Omen' card you drew and the room you are in when the haunt starts.This game can be really short, or really long. I don't think it has ever lasted more than 3 hours for my group of 4-5. It really depends on when the haunt starts (random) and if the haunt has even sides between the good and bad people. Most of the time, one side is seriously stronger than the other. But that all depends on when the haunt starts and what people have found by then. It stays fun by being unpredictable.The instructions are a bit iffy with respect to some things... but it is fine overall. They need to work on the rulebook and make things more clear. Lastly I will say that the component quality is very good. Everything looks well made. Go ahead and grab the expansion for an added level to the house and 50 more haunts!\\n\\n\",\n",

Even during the exploring half, there was always something happening to keep us engaged. The game is made to be slightly different every time, which keeps it from getting stale. My teenage siblings were begging to play again. All the pieces are very good quality and the rules were easy to understand.Cons: VERY dark themes and a little scary. When my toddler was in the room, we didn't read our cards out loud. And when we played it at night, we had to play another goofy game before we went to bed.

Each of you has a win condition, so you\\'re kept secret because knowing the win condition makes it easier to stop the other team.This is where knowing some horror movie tropes comes in.

And I was honestly a little scared because they made me stay by myself in the bathroom while they discussed their strategy as the humans trying to escape the house. The game will be hard for people who like clear rules and instructions since it sometimes doesn't provide it or it's buried in some obscure section of the manual. I'm someone who is flexible, who thinks it's fine as long as we stay consistent with whatever rules we decide on. Whereas another player was really annoyed because having a poorly chosen rule (even if it is inconsistent) can make the game unfair.I would like the game better if they made a non-scary version.

I love the mechanics of finding out who is the traitor halfway through the game and building the map as you go. My only real critique is build quality and some haunts can end very quickly depending on character builds.Build Quality: The insert for organizing the game for storage is terrible. You will want to replace it or remove it. If you want to combine the expansion and the base into 1 box you will HAVE to replace the insert. The clips use to track the stats per character are horrible. They are way too loose and can slip when you aren't paying attention. They sell an upgrade pack to fix this but you could just use pen and paper or paperclips instead. Everything else in the box is pretty high quality. The character models aren't that great but do the job.Haunts: They're random so you can't really plan ahead but sometimes you get just the right character stats to break a haunt and it can end in a few turns. The other haunts we got were pretty fun and balanced for both the traitor and the heroes.Overall I love this game but if using a fantasy theme doesn't bother you, I highly recommend buying the Betrayal at Baldur's Gate version instead. It has slightly upgraded mechanics and the characters feel more unique. The clips feel a bit better too.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  This is one of my favorite board games!Basically, you build a mansion as you go, exploring new rooms and encountering events, items, and omens along the way. No two games are ever the same except I always seem to get the mystic elevator!At a certain point you start the haunt, which is where you will discover that one player has turned traitor, there is a hidden traitor, or there is no traitor at all, but you still need to do certain  things to win. There are 50 haunts in the base game, and 50 more in the expansion.  I have played the base game quite a few times and still haven't played all of the haunts.The rules are mostly straight forward. I recommend watching a game play video before or after you read the rules to get a better idea of how to play. Some of the haunts have things that come up that aren't clearly outlined in the rules but you and your group will most likely become able to make good judgement calls when you are used to the game.As I mentioned, there is now an official expansion for the game that adds new haunts, an additional floor, new tokens, and new cards.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nOne of those \"classics\" that you should own.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\n  This game is basically comprised of two parts. In the first, you and the other players are explorers randomly revealing room tiles as you maneuver throughout the house.Many rooms will have an Event, Item or Omen associated with it and after you reveal the tile, you take a corresponding card and read it aloud. This furthers the story along and does a great job of giving the gameplay a lot of character and depth. I always love games where thematic, bite sized stories are incorporated into it (I.e. The Crossroads cards in Dead of Winter or the story book in Above and Below).Discovering and drawing Omen cards will move a counter in a track that you\\'ll roll against. Eventually, youll fail the roll and the second part of the game (the haunt) begins.One of the players will become the Traitor at this point. He/she will take a special Traitor book and go into another room to read what they will be trying to do from that point forward. The other players will read from a Heroes book and concoct a strategy based on the details they are given.From that point forward the Traitor works against the Heroes. It\\'s very fun, very engaging and playing with scary sound effect/music in the background is a hit.This is basically one of those \"must have\" games if you\\'re a board \"gamer\".It is not without its faults however. First, the components/artwork are probably the worst I\\'ve ever seen. You\\'ll need to heat the minis in boiling water and bend them back in place as well as heat the small tracker pieces that go on your characters board and pinch them together as they WILL fall off. I laughed when we played the first time as the \"Ballroom\" tile is about as ballroom looking as an empty shed. The art is horrendous and everything feels cheap. This is a game that can benefit from a WELL MADE rerelease.Second, the instructions do a fairly good job but they don\\'t cover all situations (no instruction booklet in any game ever does) so you WILL need to clarify some things during game via Googling or through agreements by the players.Is it a \"family\" game? It does deal with occult topics and has monsters and is intended to be \"scary\". Cards can reference pentagrams, etc. so if you\\'re offended by that sort of thing (lighten up!) then this isn\\'t one for you and your family.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\n\\n  I was introduced to the original game about 15 years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it!  It's equal parts RPG and Board game with mystery, horror, and survival built in!  It was discontinued for a hot second, and original versions of the game could be found online or used, but the price usually exceeded $80 or more.  A few years back, the re-release came out - still a little hefty in price.  So, I waited.  FINALLY it went down to half off on my favourite shopping site and I nabbed it up.  I have such great memories of playing this game, and I love teaching it to new people.  There are a ton of little bits and pieces, and there is a slight learning curve, but once you get rolling, it guarantees hours of fun.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\n\\n  Our game night group all pitched in to get this game, and it was absolutely worth it. Most fun I\\'ve had with a board game in a while. Thematically, the game is very fun, and the artwork and design elements are nice and spooky, while keeping a fun playful atmosphere. Great for a Halloween game night, obviously.This game has a lot of replayability. Since you build the house as you go, the layout of the board is going to be different each game. And the 50 different \"Haunt scenarios\" means you will have 50 outcomes, with specific rules and objectives, so you will never play the same exact game twice.If anything, I\\'d say due to the many variables in the game, there are a lot of cards and pieces to keep track of. Might take you a couple plays through to figure out how to use all the elements. Would also recommend it more for folks who are a little more seasoned in board games. The rules can be daunting for novice players.As far as shipping, the game arrived in one piece, pristine condition, with all its parts and pieces intact.\\n\\n',\n",
