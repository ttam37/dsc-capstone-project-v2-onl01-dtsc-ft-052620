DO NOT BUY!!!
","

  I would give this zero stars if I could! If you‚Äôre into the original sorry game, DON‚ÄôT buy this version. They changed the rules entirely while ruining the whole game! There are no longer 4 pawns per person, they only have 3! And rather than only being able to get out on a 1 or 2, you can now get out on any number.. oh and the ‚Äúsorry!‚Äù card which allows you to bump someone back to start, now also has the option to move 4 places. It‚Äôs like this game was created for this new generation of entitled children that can‚Äôt take the time to finish a challenging game the right way without throwing a fit because they have instant gratification issues. Wish I opened it sooner so I could return it. I am very diasspointed in this update!!

Is this the millennial version?
","

  This is not the original sorry game. It only has 3 pawns per team instead of the traditional 4. The rules are different also. These rules state that you can exit your home zone with any forward moving card..which is everything except for 4?!?! They ruined the game! This is like the millennial version, do everything to make it easier for the players to make it a quick game. Very sad. Look for the original!

Wimp and Crybaby Edition
","

  We bought this to replace our old Sorry game that was falling apart.  I wish we had read the reviews first instead of assuming it was still the classic Sorry--it is definitely not.Differences:- Game board design (doesn't look as good, but it doesn't interfere with play)- 3 pawns instead of 4- Sorry cards can be used to move you forward 4 spaces- Can leave Start on ANY forward-moving card- The 2 card doesn't have you draw againHonestly, if I had known those things, I would NOT have bought this game.  One reviewer called it the Millennial version, and I'm going to agree.  The original game was an excellent tool for teaching kids to suck it up if things didn't go the way they wanted.  Everyone else's pawns are out and yours are still in Start because you haven't drawn a 1 or 2?  Too bad!  Your opponent drew a Sorry card and sent you home?  Deal with it!  This new version is for wimps and crybabies.And why only 3 pawns?  Cutting costs, most likely.Hasbro, you've mucked up a great game.  I'll be looking for the real version and donating this one (though I might put a warning on the box).

NOT the original/regular Sorry!
","

  Be warned that this is not the sorry you grew up with. This has only three tokens per player, and the rules are different and make it much easier and in my opinion not as fun. I think this version is good for kids ages 4-8ish. My kids are a little older so we returned this and got the original version, which we all love. I don't think the description on this one is clear enough, so we didn't know we weren't getting the normal Sorry that's been around for decades.

  Definitely not the classic game, with only 3 pawns each and cards instead of dice, but this version did go significantly faster than I recall from my childhood. I bought this along with some other games for our biweekly game nights and was pretty disappointed when I opened the box. But it turned out pretty okay. It will be easier to play with younger kids (or adults like my husband) with short attention spans.

This is an excellent set in a sturdy box with good cards
","

  This is an excellent set in a sturdy box with good cards, pawns, and gameboard in it for playing a new version of Sorry, not the classic version. For the price and what you get, it's worth it. I knew, though, what I was buying when I bought this game set...that's why I only gave it a 4. I bought it to get the colored cards that were in this set because that's what my daughter wanted for her kids and no other set had them. I put the colored cards in the classic Sorry game set I'm giving my grandson for his birthday. I knew when I bought it that there were only three pawns of each color...I'm giving the pawns to her to use as spares (you know how little things get lost when you have kids! LOL!). I'm not a fan of the tri-fold gameboard, but this gameboard did lie flat without a gap, even though it was thinner that other Sorry gameboards. The pawns are sturdy and in opaque bright colors and the game cards were a trifle thinner than other Sorry game cards but sturdy enough for the usual playing of the game. All in all, if you realize that what you are getting is a new version of Sorry, not the classic version, you will be happy with the quality of the product. I am happy with the quality of the product.

  I think Amazon needs to offer a minus star category! Hasbro missed the mark by a country mile on this game.

Not the same Sorry I grew up with.
","

  This is not the original Sorry I grew up with. They made it way too easy, by changing a few rules (you can move out of start with any forward-moving number card, instead of having to draw a 1 or 2) and decreasing the amount of pieces to move per player to 3. After playing the old one with my young kids, this one was a major let down. If you can, track down the older version. Skip this one.

  If you are familiar at all with the older version of this game, and loved it like our family did, you may not care for this newer version as much.  The older version provided 4 pawns per person, and the play cards used to have more cards with specific direction, rather than just moving the amount of spaces shown on the card.  This new version offers only 3 pawns per player, and as mentioned before, most of the cards only instruct you to move forward.  This version is boring, and less entertaining, it moves too quickly, and overall, is a disappointment.  I still like to concept of the game, but I would recommend that if you can find an older version, to get that one.

  This felt like the sissy version of Sorry! I played as a kid. You have three pawns instead of four, so you already have less of a challenge. Then the cards changed to make the game easier. You used to have to wait for a one or two to get your pawn out of start. Now, almost any card gets your pawns on the board. It's a lot less challenging, and a lot less ruthless. There really isn't much opportunity for ""revenge"" because the game is too easy. I was incredibly disappointed when I played. So much so, I want to buy a better version and turn this one into a drinking game or give it away.

","

  TLDR version; if you can get an extra pawn of each color, this version is playable as the classic version. Long version: This is NOT the classic game of Sorry; it is a stripped down children's version, and the packaging fails to show it. It is now only 3 pawns instead of 4, you can leave Home on any movement card (instead of 1 or 2) and the Sorry! card allows you to move 4 as an option to swapping places with another player. We fortunately had an extra set of 4-each pawns from a discarded copy of the game.  There is still the original count of 45 cards; you can just play with classic rules for the cards. Honestly, the components are good quality. If you buy this version, at least round up an extra pawn for each color, and it can be played OK. (Or don't buy it at all!)

  This game is very cheaply made. The game cover will not lay flat on the board causing the pieces to fall off their place while playing the game causing frustration. I would not recommend this game to anyone.

Dollar Store Quality

  Confusing rules. Poorly made. Pegs fall off when the lightweight board is even just jostled. Popper hard for kids to press and doesn't really roll the dice correctly. Hard to insert the flimsy paper insert under the side flaps which are supposed to hold it down. Rules are way too confusing. Here's a suggestion, download the classic instruction sheet from 2002 off the internet. Just search for ""Trouble Game Capital"" and there is the perfect PDF of the good old rules you remember. Box is thinner than a cereal box and opens with tuck in flaps, so get a zipper bag to store the pegs in. By the way, the box is not shrink-wrapped, just sloppily taped shut, so use a knife to slit the tape before opening. They've cut every corner for this game to keep the price low. It's dollar store quality, cheap and cheerful. Ignore the red numeral 1 on the dice, it's for some stupid new rule. Likewise ignore the ""Warp"" and ""XX"" markings on the board and just play by the old rules. Better yet look for a vintage set at a thrift store. Just use this cheapie to get started playing.

Lacks In Quality All Around
","

  I wanted to get this game for my kids because they had been playing around with a McDonald's Happy Meal version for a while, but that version was problematic and mostly garbage (except for the dice popper).  I saw that there was a 'Retro' edition which I remember as the design from my childhood, but it was a lot more expensive than I thought the game should be. I saw that Hasbro had updated the game  and it was really inexpensive. Since this was going to be a bit of an introduction to board games for my kids I didn't want to spend a ton.That should have been my first clue - that the ""retro"" one was almost 3x the price. The product that arrived is so flimsy and cheap on so many levels. The box it comes in is a thin card stock that barely holds its shape. The game board: there are two components that you need put together yourself for some reason. The plastic part is very thin and very wobbly. The card stock insert (which is the same thickness as the box, by the way) is flimsy. Even the playing pieces feel cheap; There's no weight to them at all. They don't stay on the pegs all that well (the original had holes for the pieces to stand in). I can already see that playing this is going to be a bit of a hassle all around. I know that kids get excited and will end up bumping the table or the board, and the pegs are going to go flying off their location because they have no weight to them nor anything to really hold them to their places. The original board and its pieces were very hefty and an incredible quality when compared to this updated version.The only positives I can give this version is the addition to some variant rules, which will come in handy when the kids want a change, and the dice popper functions rather well. I think I might spring for that ""Retro"" version after all.

Cheapest material I've ever seen

  I loved this game as a child and was excited to order it for my children.  This is either a knock off or Hasbro has failed miserably at maintaining quality standards.  This game is worse quality material than dollar store toys. I am so upset at the horrible quality.  It is a cheap piece of cardstock that you put over the thin plastic--NOTHING like this game used to be.  I am so angry that I spent actual money on this.  I would love for my kids to be able to play this game, but the only way we will be able to do so is if we find a vintage one somewhere...  SO SUPER DISAPPOINTING.  Save your money!

Reliving my childhood fav game
","

  In this day and age of video games and cell phone apps, it is great to be able to go to one of the retro games from my childhood and show the young kids how much fun it was. This game is great because you can learn the rules in a few minutes and the set up is a cinch. Just put your colored pegs in the correct color coded slots and you are ready for the best part of the game- the popper. I used to love the satisfying click of pushing it and seeing the dice tumble. Getting that number you need is a tiny thrill or getting to send an opponent back is worth a laugh or two.  I love this old fashioned game and appreciate that we can still buy it. It will hold up well for a whole new generation to play and love. This would be a great game to take along on camping trips if the kids get bored or need some down time.

  I bought this as a gift for my child and unfortunately due to the time frame I am unable to return it. This game is defective and does not work according to the directions. The bubble in the center of the board does not ‚Äúpop‚Äù which does not allow the dice to flip which is a key component of the game. Without the popping mechanism this game is unable to be played. The game was not shipped in plastic/wrapped according to new product shipping information. It was closed with small pieces of tape indicating that the packaged game had been put together by a third party. I will not be using this seller in the future and am now having to replace the game from a brick and mortar retailer.

Same great game - but very cheaply made
","

  This is an updated version of the classic game Trouble. It has some extra gimicks to it, but the game play is essentially the same as always. I loved the game as a kid and was excited that my oldest was ready to play it too.However, Hasbro has really cheaped out in how they're producing the board to the point of making it almost disposable. The game consists of a plastic board with a paper overlay (yes, paper not even card stock) for the board which the pegs fit through. The paper board overlay is, well, thin paper. Mine came already ripped/crumpled in one corner, so was returned. The board is fairly thin plastic, though the pop-o-matic bubble seems to be of reasonable quality (actually hard for a little kid to press). However, since the pieces sit on top of pegs (instead of in cups as in older releases), any time the board is bumped or jostled the pieces are likely to fall out.So still a good game... but if you can find the older boards, it's probably a better bet to go for one of them. I'm planning on buying one of those (still available on Amazon) to replace mine.

IMPORTANT Detail
","

  There are a lot of bad reviews for this version of Trouble because of the board quality/design.  A lot of complaints especially regarding how the paper-thin board graphic sits on top of the thin plastic base. It's important to note that there are two small plastic lips on opposite sides of the plastic board that should hold the graphic in place.  Once I ""installed"" the graphic correctly, we never had issues with it coming off and messing up the board.  It's still fairly easy to knock off the pieces if kids aren't careful, but I see it as a good hand/eye coordination lesson.  I was a bit disappointed with the quality, but had no issues with it once the game got underway.  It's just going to get trashed anyway, especially with young kids.  If they get older and still love the game, spring for a more expensive one, but I assure you, my kids weren't complaining of a cheap game.  They were too busy having fun.  If I had to change one thing, it would be the box the game is stored in.  If that were a little thicker, it would be better.  I don't see it lasting very long and then I'll have to figure out where to keep the board and pieces.  It's about the same thickness as a cereal box.

Super fun game
","

  This is such a classic game, and easy for kids to learn. The goal of the game is to get all of your pieces around the board and into the home section that matches your color. You do so by pushing down the pop-o-matic dice. It can sometimes be difficult for kids to roll the dice, as the pop up thing tends to get stuck. The quality is okay. It's not the greatest but for the price I can't complain. The top part of the game is a flimsy paper that comes right off the board. However, it's an overall fun game, and a hit at family game nights.

  What a disappointment!  This was my SO's favorite game growing up.  I went on a board game buying rampage and added this to the list for a slice of childhood nostalgia.  Now I'm particular about my board games.  They have to be in new condition, it has to be a complete set, the box should not be damaged (minor dings from being shipped or in the store okay).  This one just didn't make the cut!Hasbro must have cut every corner to save costs because this feels like something you would find in the dollar store.  Not a quality game like I remember it being.  From the box, to the packaging, to the game itself -- this did not carry the same quality as other games I own from Hasbro, Milton-Bradley, Parker Brothers, etc.Don't know if this was due to Hasbro or to Amazon fulfillment but it did not come in the condition it was promised.  It was sold as factory sealed but came in a battered box (crunched in) and taped at the sides where it opens.  I even started a ticket to return the item but it just wasn't worth the trouble!

What do you want for $7?  FUN buy!!!  Cheaply made (and priced) - perfect for a young child who is going to lose pieces!
","

  As the price should indicate to you this is a VERY cheap version of the game.  It is ideal for a 4 or 5 year old who is likely to lose pieces.Pros:  Affordability priced!  Can't say this enough!  FUN!  My 5 year old wants to play this NON-STOP!Cons: VERY cheaply made.  It is a thin injection molded piece of plastic with a ""pop-o-matic"" (pom) built into the middle.  Even the ""pom"" is much cheaper than the original which sometimes allows the die to land on the same side multiple times.  It's so cheaply made that even the piece of construction paper which the graphics are printed on comes assembled.  The pieces are loose on the board and fall off if someone bumps the board.Would I recommend you buy this?  ABSOLUTELY!  What do you want for seven bucks?  You get what you pay for.  When compared to the full / quality version of this game it's a 1 star at best.  But when compared with the price it's a 4.5 star.  It's tons of fun to play with your wee-ones!

  This is a super cheap version of this game, even for the price. Definitely worth the extra 5 bucks or so to get the original version if you want it to last a while with kids using it (the box definitely won't last). I returned this as it was so cheap looking I was embarrassed to give it as a gift. Now, if you just want the game and no one is concerned about high quality, it did look functional.

Cheap and flimsy version of the original game
","

  I can't believe the poor quality of this latest version of Trouble.  I bought it for our autism classroom because of the simple rules and dice that won't get lost or thrown around.  I don't think it will hold up very well.  The plus is that the game board comes with the classic, built-in, pop-o-matic die roller.  The minuses are that the board has a lot of give to it and could probably be bent without much effort.  The board also comes blank and is made of solid black plastic (the classic game is made of clear plastic with the colored game board attached underneath).  This version includes a flimsy cardstock template that you have to place over the top of the board.  There is virtually nothing to hold the template on so I am going to have to glue it in place since it will be subjected to a classroom full of young children with autism who will tear it apart at the first opportunity.  I will go ahead and bring it to class but I'm also headed straight to eBay to see if I can buy a Trouble game from a few years back that is of higher quality.  Poor job Hasbro!

Very Cheap Feel to a Classic Game
","

  I'm really disappointed in the new version of Trouble.The old version had a nice plastic molded game board. The pieces sat in the holes as you went around and it was sturdy. The board was sandwiched in the plastic, and didn't move.This version feels very cheap. The box does not have a lid that lifts off, instead, the side opens, and you slide the game in and out. It's not a good storage box unlike most games. The board itself is a black piece of plastic with a thin paper covering that has the board printed on it. The paper is not attached to the plastic mold at all! I did find where I could lift it up, and slide it under the slightly wider edges on two sides to hold it down a little better. The pieces sit on top of the pegs, and the paper lifts up constantly. I'm going to have to pull the paper off, and glue it down myself.I'm not too fond of the new ""warp"" which takes you across the board, since Trouble is a quick game anyway. The warp feature makes it a quicker game - about 10 minutes for 2 players.

Can't Beat A Classic Board Game For This Price

  Bought this to play with family every now and then, as I used to play this game all the time as a kid 20 years ago. The product feels cheaper than the Trouble game I remember from 20 years ago; and the actual board game is a cardboard sheet that slides over the plastic molding with the dice bubble in it. Pieces are thinner and not as thick as they used to be as well.HOWEVER! None of this is a deal-breaker, it still is, and plays exactly like the Trouble game I remember. And the cheaper manufacturing I mentioned above can be forgiven because you're getting a colorful board game for just $5-6 delivered to your home in 2 days. RECOMMEND and 5 STARS.

  I liked the price of this game. (It cost me less than five dollars.) However, the box was smashed, and the shipping carton did not indicate that it happened during shipping. The game is fun, but I'm not really a fan of the new features. It is cheaply made, but mine looks different and better than the photos in the reviews here. The pieces do seem to jump off the board too easily when popping the dice ball. The ball came looking scratched, and I wonder how long it will last. It's served its purpose so far, but it's not the same as the game I remember. I think I'll spring for the retro Trouble in the future.

  I am so disappointed in this product. It is SO cheaply made. The game board is really heap tin plastic, and the colorful surface of the game is a piece of cardboard that comes separate in the box that you have to pop onto the game board in order to play. It is so cheap that it should be embarrassing to Amazon.

Cheap rendition of a classic game.
","

  This is the Trouble game, but it's not the classic trouble game. The board is a paper cut-out that you fit over the plastic frame. When you press on the popper, the pieces all jump out of their holes. Also, my tiny 4 year old cracked the popper by pushing too hard. We threw this one in the trash when my in-laws bought the classic game for my girl.

Expectations of a cheaper game
","

  Remember the price when you get this. For such a cheap price, this game isn't what I expected. You have to put the top cover on the game, it doesn't stick on. Just thin cardboard for the main part of the game on plain black plastic. The pieces have no where to go when putting it away. So a sandwich baggie is needed to keep pieces together. It feels cheap, but for the price you have to expect it. Great for a game for young children. That way if it does get ruined it isn't so hard on the wallet.

  The game is great.we play almost every night when we sit down to have dinner. Which brings me to the 2 star rating. In this day and age of making everything cheaper, the board is printed on paper thinner than card stock and sits on top of the frame. It is also not laminated in any way. All of this makes it easy to etc dirty with no good way to clean it without ruining it.

  Game and bouncy dice tool are fun for kids and adults to play together.  The box that this version of the game came with was utter crap however.  Almost guaranteed loss of pieces due to the lack of interlocking top and bottom like typical game boxes.  Other than poor box, game seems good to go.

Million dollar company-- fix your cases!!!!

  My son has been asking for this game so I got it for him for his birthday. I debated getting the electronic one but after reading reviews decided not to.I used to love this game as a kid. But we all know that they just don't make anything the way they used to.The game itself is fun. But the actual product is terrible! The cases are so cheap and feel like they're going to break. And the worst thing-- they are NOT big enough. If you put all the pegs where they are supposed to go to store, it won't close. You have to take some out and put them somewhere else, or like we do, just put them in the middle of the case. Are you kidding me? You couldn't spend the extra pennies to make it big enough? And even when you can close it, they never seem to close all the way. Which means I can't even throw away the box and just store the cases, unless you put them in a Ziploc bag or something. Otherwise, I am sure you will lose the pieces or have a mess after they open and spill. So disappointing!

Lots of design flaws
","

  I definitely don't recommend buying this game. My grandkids play it at their house, so I bought one for mine. I didn't read the reviews since I knew they liked playing the game - big mistake. Hasbro must really be cutting corners cost-wise. The bins for the pegs are skimpy, making it easy for pegs to fall out, and the case doesn't close fully when all of the pegs are in the bins. I'm keeping the white pegs in plastic zip-locks and dividing the red ones between the red and white bins. All of the pegs come in one plastic bag, and the instructions say to divide each color evenly between the 2 cases. Seems like they could easily have put half of each color in a separate bag. BTW, handling the small pegs is not meant for people with arthritis in their hands. The ships are meant to be stored in another side section, but it's difficult to get them in place and they easily fall out of their ""berths."" As others have said, it's difficult to see the letters and numbers identifying the rows and columns of the grid - a contrasting color to the background would have been great. If I had it to do over, I'd teach the grandkids to play the game with paper and pencil - easier, more fun (more ships, easily identified by the first letter of their names), and of course much less expensive.

Yet another fine example of style being favored over utility.

  The ""new"" design of this classic game is terrible.  When all of the pieces are counted out and placed in their respective reservoirs the plastic top barely clasps down (see photos). What was wrong with the classic design hasbro? Some genius marketing whiz at HQ think battleship needed a facelift? The left side of the board has neat little spots to place the ships. This is a moot point however because if you move the unit at all they fall right out of their designated places, which begs the question: why bother? Obviously the game plays just fine but I cant reccommend this poorly designed version.

  Was worried about buying this based on other reviews, but went ahead and went for it since my 6 1/2 year old son loves the travel version so much (which is terrible because you can't mark which spots on your ships have been hit).  Honestly, although maybe a touch smaller than the old 1980's version, it's very similar.  We haven't had issues with pegs falling out.  The ships can pop out of place if you knock into the board, but if you keep it on the floor or a table, no worries.  My son is already enjoying having a much better way to play this game!

Letters and Numbers extremely hard to read

  I am thoroughly disappointed with this ""new"" version of the classic Battleship game.  Each player's ""board"" includes the standard pieces -- ships and pegs. But the left hand column of letters and top row of numbers are very hard to distinguish from their background.  The numbers / letters are imprinted into the the plastic material, so it is difficult to play the game without light aimed directly at each board.  The 2 boards are cheap and flimsy; the top vertical piece in one of the boards seems to repeatedly slip out of place.

It's battleship.
","

  Well it's battleship. Its not electronic so there's not much to go wrong with it. The pegs didn't seem loose to me like I'd seen in other reviews. Two big improvements I can see is #1 the peg storage. The compartments that house the pegs just aren't quite big enough. I ended up putting the white pegs where the ships would go which isn't a big deal. #2 the letters and numbers on the upper and lower grid are incredibly hard to see. I fixed that with a strip of masking tape and wrote them on it in permanent marker. These adjustments took only a few minutes. In the end, it's a fun game. The pegs are sturdy and there are certainly plenty of them and they store inside the case along with the ships. We actually just finished playing a few rounds with the kids and when we were finished it was as simple as shutting the cases and putting them in the box. When you first get the game and open it, you will find inside the box the two cases, instructions for playing the game, a sticker sheet that has two ""Battleship"" stickers to put on the cases, a plastic grid that has the total of 10 ships (5 for each player) that you simply twist to take apart from the grid and a bag that contains all of the red and white pegs. You will need to split the pegs evenly between the two cases. After these initial steps you're ready to just open the cases to play and shut them to put them away. I gave this 4 stars just because of the minor adjustments, otherwise it's a great game.

  Battleship is a fun game for anyone of any age.I loved playing this game with my Dad and cousins, when I was growing up.I bought this for my son, because sadly I didn't keep my old set.This is not as sturdy as the sets sold in the 1980s.And I feel like they are smaller too.If you keep your board still, on a table, then the pegs are fine.But if you put it on your lap on a sofa or comfy chair,and tilt it AT ALL, in any way, the pegs will fall right out.The problem with that?  Now you might have to start all over with your guesses.The pegs don't always want to stay in the ships either.The price is right, but the boards are too cheap and flimsy, the pegsare terrible.

How to always win at Battleship:
","

  No matter what coordinates your opponent calls, say ""miss.""  Then put a white peg in that hole in your bottom board.  This way, you can move your ships wherever you want until they won't fit anywhere else.  The only way you can lose with this strategy is if your opponent is doing the same thing.  So if it gets down to the end and your ships are cornered and can no longer move, clean up all the white pegs from your bottom board and quickly accuse your opponent of cheating.Boom!  Guess who's not doing the dishes tonight?

  I've never won a single game and I continue to play, that should tell you how much I enjoy this game. I had a set when I was a kid and purchased this because it came with the individual battle packs like the old ones and who doesn't love a little nostalgia? The packs aren't exactly perfect, but I did have the high expectations. Below I listed my top complaints and simple ways to fix them so I have nothing to complain about:PROBLEMS:1. The packs have holes in the bottom so your cheater opponent can see where your ships are from the shadows2. The pack hinges are loose so it will stay up, but if you bump it say goodbye to all your naval intelligence for that round (pegs fall right out)3. The coordinate labels are the same color as the rest of the board and that makes it very hard to readSOLUTIONS1. Set your pack down, do not hold it in the air2. Sit a considerable distance away from your opponent so you do not feel the need to shield your board and risk dislodging your progress3. Play with ample table or natural lighting

  The game itself is good for learning strategy and patience. But in this version, the letters and numbers are simply raised plastic. unreadable to both a 5 year old and 45 year old. We had to make strips of tape with the coordinates on them so we could play. Since the game comes with a few decals, it would be nice if they had decals for this. Also, the lids cannot be closed on a game in progress, the ships are supposed to be stored by lining them all up in specific spaces, and the bins for the pegs aren't actually big enough to hold all the pegs (they would be if the ships could just be tossed in a bin instead of lined up). seems like basic package design flaws that could have been addressed in a game that hasn't changed in 40 years.

  Memories of playing battleship as a kids are a million times better than the reality of playing with your own kid. If you really like games find a better one.

  Battleship has a lot of little pegs. The board is designed with built-in sections that are supposed to hold the pegs. This would be a great idea, except that they didn't make these sections large enough to actually hold all of the pegs, so the pegs are always all over the place. Overall this just feels like Hasbro made this as cheaply as they possibly could.

  I wish good things would be left alone. The old pegs stuck out enough tk be grabbed easily. They also stayed put better in their places on the boards. The new pegs are short and stout. They fall out too easily also. Another thing, the storage compartments for the pegs and ships, are rather shallow. The old style worked so well. Too bad cheap beats quality.

Just like the old Battleship game of years ago.  Pieces look like they set in nicely.

  This is for a Christmas gift, but I'm sure my grandson is going to love it.  My son played for hours with a battleship game when he was young and I'm sure most men can attest to the same, even some women, too.  It is of decent size, and just like the Battleship game of old.  It seems well made, but time will tell.  For the price, you can't lose.  Buy it if you are a Battleship player!Added after Christmas..... Yes, it's a great game and well made!  We've had a lot of fun playing it!

Great remake of a classic game.

  I played regular Battleship as a kid and even electronic battleship and now this.  I like the new thicker pegs as they are easier to manipulate and pickup.  There are even spots to store the ships now with the pegholes.  My 3 kids (ages 5,7, and 8) all played it and even the 5 year old got the hang of it and enjoyed it.  This version is really portable as well, as each side folds up independently in a small form factor.  I was very impressed with it.

  I‚Äôm a huge Disney Parks fan, and have been looking forward to the release of a proper Haunted Mansion board game, especially since it was designed by the same company that worked on Villainous. I was initially worried the game would be too simple and not that replayable, but I was wrong! While it‚Äôs still definitely simple, we played four games after opening the box and still wanted to play more!The instructions are very easy to understand, and get you playing quickly. The games aren‚Äôt very long, so it‚Äôs easy to start another game.Because of how simple and easy to learn it is, it‚Äôs a great game to break out for a game night with new players, unlike how Villainous takes a few games in order to get a grasp on the rules.I highly recommend this game!

Happy Haunts Materialize!
","

  First of all: this game is not complex or hard to learn at all. Really, we learned it in probably 10 minutes just using the manual. All in all, we enjoyed this game and are glad we added it to the collection. I hope Disney continues making new board games for each ride like they have with this one and Jungle Cruise! We‚Äôve loved them. No creepy themes to be found here. Family friendly 100%.Gameplay - By taking 3 actions per turn and doing some simple strategizing, players travel throughout the Haunted Mansion encountering happy haunts and adding ghost cards to their collections. Different ghost cards score different points, and most require collecting the same cards in sets to maximize points. But beware! The hitchhiking ghosts move about the small board each turn, forcing you to draw haunt cards, which can cost you dearly at the end of the game.This game is very easy to learn and set up, and has some fun basic strategy to it that kids will grasp and adults will find entertaining. There is a fair bit of opportunity to directly hamper opponents and even steal their cards, so be prepared for some inevitable conflict depending on your group!Materials - The board is the highlight, featuring great illustrations and a fun rotating ‚Äúendless hallway‚Äù in the center of the board. Plastic figures were good quality, and even the box had fun stretching room illustrations. I felt the cards were a little flimsy and not on par with Villainous or Jungle Cruise however.Final Thoughts - this is a great addition to the collections of Disney fans, those with kids, or anyone looking for a thematic, light, And quick game of what feels like simplified Splendor with some action economy mixed in.

Perfect and EASY Set Collection Game for Any Disney Fan!
","

  Disclaimer: I am probably the BIGGEST Haunted Mansion fan out there, so I was over the moon when I received this game!First Impressions: It is such an interesting take, and tons of fun. I can see adult Disney fans and gamers playing this on a Friday night over a bottle of wine (like me), and also totally believe the box when it says 9+.The gameplay is simple: You take three actions on your turn (essentially move and collect ghost cards) and you are trying to collect sets of matching cards to get the most points at the end. There are even handy player cards that have the actions spelled out so you never need to reference the rulebook. Speaking of the rulebook, they were smart enough to partner with Geek and Sundry to have an extremely well-done how to play video with the link address right in the directions if you don't feel like reading.Replayability: Tons. Each round is made different by having event cards that change some of the rules for that turn, so although you may have a plan on how to grab the ghost cards you want, there will always be a little twist you'll have to look out for. Also, there are the Hitchhiking Ghosts (with a STUNNING model) that move around the board, and you get penalties if they cross your path. BEWARE THE HITCHHIKING GHOSTS, hahaComponents: Wow. Just wow. The art is INCREDIBLE!!!!!! Every single piece of art is stunningly crafted and each ghost card and the board art is instantly recognizable from the ride. Seriously, look at some of the pics I attached.In summary: This game is a MUST BUY! With the holidays coming up, I know what I will be getting all of my Disney buddies!!!

Quality dropping fast...

  Poor Quality Control from manufacturer.  Printing of the card symbols on the 'board' is off-centered by a good half-inch.  Doesn't affect game-play, but is pretty pathetic considering the price.  Also, the company is so interested in cutting corners now that the plastic tokens aren't two sided... so gone are the good old days when after a Sequence, you flip the 5 tokens over to freeze those chips.  Quality goes down, company profits go up.  Well... review ratings can also go down guys.

A combination of card and board game with lots of strategy
","

  We love to play games as a family.  There are four of us that usually play: my husband and I, our 9 year old daughter, and my 83 year old mom. We enjoy playing both board and card games and Sequence is a great combination of both!The game itself is really simple to learn and played in up to three teams. When the four of us splay, we find it simplest to play two teams of two.  The game indicates that it's for ages 10 and up, but my 9 year old had no trouble mastering it, although she sometimes doesn't always pay attention enough to the strategy aspect.  My 83 year old mother also has trouble with strategy sometimes!I like that a game usually goes quite quickly (less than one hour).  This is definitely a new favorite for us and I highly recommend it.

Great game, easy instructions & affordable
","

  This is an easy to learn game that has a different game play every time!  It's a bit of bingo and poker combined.  You can have 2-3 teams of single players or multiple players.  The object of the game is to create a 5 card sequence much like bingo.  Players put down a card and add a chip to one of the 2 locations of that card on the board.  Although the goal is to create a 5 card sequence, players can strategically place chips to block the others.  The twists are the one-eye jacks (can remove a chip from your opponent's growing sequence) and the two-eye jacks (wild card that allows you to place your chip anywhere on the board).  My 13 and 10 year-olds really enjoy the game.  It captured their attention for 3 - 4 rounds in one sitting.  As compared to the multi-page instructions of the Euro-games, this game is more approachable both in terms of complexity and set-up.  In addition, its affordable cost is excellent for multi-generational families.  An 8 year old child will have as much fun as an an 80 year old great grandmother!

A fun game that's good for hours of entertainment
","

  This game is so much fun. My husband and I started playing about a month ago and are learning more each time we play. We learn more about strategy and about each other's competitiveness. LOL. On the surface the game is pretty straightforward. The goal is to develop two Sequences of five chips each. The first player or team to do this wins the game. This is easier said than done. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a deck of 52. The board contains a thumbnail image for each card in the deck. Once the game starts the first player lays down a card and places a chip on the board representing the card he or she has just laid down. Then he or she picks up a new card from the deck and then the next player takes a turn. There are a few little twists and turns in this game that pump up the fun, like the one-eyed and two-eyed Jacks. Those guys are powerful! Fun for the whole family.

Game is classic but product quality degraded.
","

  This review pertains not to the game in general but the quality of the product lately. I have had the exact set before but I took it to a friends place once and it never came back! They loved it...so much for the game itself.I ordered it again in December 2018 but was disappointed to see that quality of the materials used has deteriorated considerably. The chips are lighter, cheaper plastic, the fold-able board seems fragile, the card deck is very very light - almost feels a tad thicker than printer paper. Instructions now printed on what seems like recycled paper (I don't mind that, but worth noting). Yes, I did get it for a bargain at $12. However, now it makes sense why the price was low. Too bad that they made it look like an offer price. Honestly I would not mind paying $20 for a better quality version. Should have tried the Tin case version, but who knows if they are any different.If anyone is reading for what the game is like - CLASSIC. Just buy this, easy to learn and a lot of fun to play!

After playing a couple times she quickly because proficient and learning some strategy and it because her favorite game. This game is great because you can play strategically with advanced players or go easily on new players to let them learn and not smash their spirits. We had lots of fun playing this with teams of larger groups and with just two people. I would say 5 and up for the age range. Adults had lots of fun too.We marked or put stickers on the back sides of the chips. That way when someone got a sequence we flipped the chips over so show they couldn't be removed anymore.

Fun, easy to play, game of chance and strategy

  My daughter got this for Christmas and the family has enjoyed playing this game quite a lot. There is some strategy to the game if you want to win, but the element of chance plays a huge role in this game. There are very few rules and the game easy to learn; easy to play.To clarify, the game comes with only 3 different colors of tokens. Many people can play at the same time, but no more than 3 teams. So you can play with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12 players (any number divisible by 2 or 3). Of course, with too many players, each one will hold very few cards, limiting his options. We've had the most fun with 3 or 4 players. Still hoping to try 6.

Fun Game, Arrived in Mint Condition

  We've wanted one of these games ever since we've played it with friends and family. It's not as simple as it seems and fun to boot. Our order came faster than anticipated, in good shape and with all the pieces in the box. The only thing I wish, would be for the chips to have a marker of sorts on one side, so that you can identify finished lines without doubling them up. On the other hand, I have an old bottle of bright gold nail polish which will serve just as well to mark the chips.

  So happy I bought this game. A definite one to have in your game closet. Played with regular playing cards, corresponding to the playing card pics on the board. Placing chips on the board according to what cards you hold.. Object is to get 5 chips (of your/or your teams') in a row. A sequence. If you are playing with four people. Two sequences first for your team, wins. Wild cards make it fun, just when you think you have it! Fairly quick game. Easy to learn.

Family favorite - highly recommend this board game!

  I love this game!! The first time I played it at a friend's house, I liked it so much that I ordered it on Amazon later that same night!! We have over 40 board games in our game closet, and this one is in the top 10% of group games we like to play. You can play it with only 2 people and it's still fun, but we prefer to play it with 4 or 6 people. When family members come over and I suggest various other board games to play, they frequently say ""We want to play Sequence instead!"" It's an easy game to learn, and involves strategy (but not to the level of something like Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, The Palace of Mad King Ludwig, or Agricola). Game play is made more difficult because you can't ""talk across the table"" to your team member(s) to strategize, but that just adds to the overall fun!!! By the way, you'll want to price compare for this game. Historically, Amazon has been the cheapest place to buy it. I bought Sequence on Amazon a year and a half ago and paid $13.99. It's now down to $9.97 on Amazon. During the Christmas holidays, Walmart was selling Sequence for like $17 or $18! It's gone down now - but my point is to shop around for the current prices! :) Anyways, I highly recommend this board game - it'll be a family favorite in your household!!

Depends what you like

  I played this a long time ago and remembered liking it so I recently purchased it to play with my large family. We have been trying new games weekly. We love Connect 4 and Penta (for 2 players, the 4 player was not fun). I liked this game but it wasn't amazing. My kids got tired of it towards the end of the game. I think maybe for a 2 player it is better because you can be more strategic, that strategy doesn't translate as well on teams especially where you can't talk. It was good, but not great. I ended up returning it because I knew it just wouldn't be a game we would play that often.

Should be named ""Draw Jacks and Win""
","

  This game has potential but needs to be tweaked somehow.There is some strategy, but it's mostly about luck. Jacks are the key to the game: Jacks can be used as wildcards or to remove an opponent's chip.If you draw more Jacks than your opponent, you will win, as simple as that.I've only played this game with two players---I think it may play better with 3 players.Suggested tweak: distribute the Jacks equally amongst players at the start of the game, then luck will play less into the outcome and the Jacks will have to be played strategically.

Great game!  Needed quick fix to play 2 people
","

  Love this game - great for 2 to 6 people.  Each person keeps the same amount of cards in their hands while discarding cards that have a matching card space open on the board - placing a chip there.  Once you get 5 chips in a row you win - with two people only you have to get two rows of 5.  When playing with two people only one side of the chips are supposed to be painted to signify the first row of 5 chips achieved....  these chips were NOT painted on one side.  A permanent marker solved the issue easily but should have arrived as needed - loss of a star rating.  Board is small compared to size of delux sized board, but regular game comes with cardboard style board and Delux comes with cloth style board for easy travel.

  Represented as ""new"", looked new when received because it was shrink wrapped.  Played a number of times with 2 players, and totally enjoyed this game.  The trouble was discovered with 4 players.  The number of red markers was only half as many as the other colors.  We hoped we could substitute poker chips but they are too big and block the square. Disappointing.  We felt cheated.  We speculated that someone returned the game for whatever reason, and the seller assumed it was ""good as new"" and reshrink wrapped.  It was a several months later that we discovered the defect, so we did not return it.  Now we use dimes for the red chips since we have been unable to buy suitable replacements.

Chips are not painted on reverse side.
","

  As this is a favorite game for us, we have had many sets and variations. If you are familiar with the game, you know that once a Sequence is made, those 5 chips are turned over. On all prior sets, the reverse side is painted  or shaded white. This set has a different pattern on each side, but there is no white shading or paint. This makes it very frustrating and nearly impossible to play if you don't have great eyesight. We tossed the useless chips and kept the chips from an old game. On the plus side, the board is nice and sturdy and folds twice. the cards are nice quality also.

Not that the return window is anyone's fault but our own...it just sucks because I would never think to open a game that doesn't have any mechanical parts to make sure all the pieces are in there before it's too late.

  Played this ONCE with husband vs. brother and sister-in-law.  We were strategy savvy and thought game would NEVER END!  Since we knew to block opponents' sequence, almost entire board filled before a team won.  We had reshuffled and then drew (over and over) dead cards.  Okay for less savvy kids, but use green and black chips.  Rules state red chips are used only when 3 players or teams.  Less chips are needed for 3 so maker produced less red chips!  We'll change rules if ever play again:  All jacks AND JOKERS wild and can't be used to block (cards can still.)  Then should go faster.  Can't imagine trying to play it with more than 4.  There's supposed to be no table talk!

The game board is covered with cards like the cards in your hand. You can put your playing piece down on a card image that matches your hand. Five in a row and you win.

  We are big FAMILY Gamers. We were excited to see the high reviews on this game. Upon receiving it, the game box, board, pieces are very well built. The first round we played, with four people (ages 4, 7, 10, and an Adult) was easy to learn by all... However, after dealing the cards, there wasn't a single sequence made throughout the whole game play, after every card was played... Just a whole bunch of pieces all over the board... It just seems like a game of luck, based on what cards you get... But you won't know that luck until slowly going through each card and placing down a piece on the board... I can very well see this as a game that sits in the closet until we need to make room for other cool games, that we ultimately Goodwill it.

  We've got already a version of this game. It is great to play, especially for 4 or 6 people. So why only two stars? I bought this game again. It looked like exactly the same version as we bought many years ago. I wanted to have a second set for our vacation home in the mountains. The cover of the box was identical. But the quality of the content is just plain bad. Everything feels cheap - is cheap as a matter of fact. I've never had such a bad quality of play cards in my hands before - never ever. And the faces on the cards are just ugly. The game is great to play but rather invest in the deluxe version. You will have so much more fun with it than with this version!

Fun game for two or three!
","

  This is a fun game for two or three players! The downside is that the most who can play at a time, but that's ok. It keeps those playing having to plan and strategize while waiting their turn, so you are always involved. Best played at a table you can sit around, like a small card table or coffee table as we do.I would call this game a mix between connect five, bingo and cards because you use the playing cards to get five in a row on the board, but it is by chance like bingo because you only can play what you hold... And a bit of strategy in what to play when. It is fun!! Highly recommended for thinkers and game board players. It can be fun for anyone who likes games and can distinguish the different cards easily (age/intellect appropriate). Fun!!

Fun for the whole family and easy to play

  I bought this game for my grandma for Christmas and she loved it. My grandma loves to play all kind of games and has been playing board games and card games every week with one of her friends for as long as I can remember. I used to play with her too when I was younger and I wanted to find her something new that I thought she might enjoy. I played with her and other family members on Christmas and everyone who played enjoyed it. It is also very easy to understand which made it easier to explain to every new person wanting to play. Many friends told me they were going to look it up when they go home and I ended up buying one for myself as well

  Our new favorite family game. It takes about 15 minutes to finish a game. So, it is quick enough that everyone enjoys it.

  We've introduced this game to many of our friends -- and every one of them has commented on how much fun it is to play, particularly in teams.  If fact, most have purchased their own and are introducing their friends to it.  It's easy to learn, not overly long to play and has great strategic possibilities with options to remove an opponents piece or utilize a wild card for your own or to block an opponent.  When we have friends over for dinner they inevitably say; ""Dinner was great, but when can we play Sequence?""

  Where to start!  This game is highly fun!  You can play 2 players, 3 players, 4 players or 6 players!  We normally play 2 teams 4 players.  The game is simple yet fun, its connect the dots with a touch of bingo in there.  You draw your cards and play them down, there are 2 places on the board you can put your tokens on and you and your team mates try to get the in a row going.  Jacks are wilds and remove cards depending if they are 1 eyed or 2 eyed.  This is a great game for the family and even younger kids can play this.

  I played this when at a friends home, their family loved it and so did mine!It is a new twist on playing cards- the goal is to get them in a sequence on the board.  It is easy to l earn and really fun.  I recommend this game- BUT do not buy the ""Letters Sequence"" game for kids the cards and the board do not match, it is letters and pictures, everyone has to use the legend of what goes where, gets old having to look it up and pass the paper around.

  Sequence is one of the best games ever made - underrated. But Amazon's offering came with clear stickers keeping it shut as opposed to being wrapped in clear shelf presenting plastic, so the paper box is exposed during shipping. This makes it seem less new and harder to wrap. I would have purchased it if I had known. Another Amazon mistake by me and them. I paid 13.97 on 11-2019.

  I really enjoy this game.  It's a rather simple game that's based on strategy and little luck.  It requires very little set up and you can typically get through a game in less than 30 minutes (with three players).  Sometimes, it's nice to have a simple game on hand that doesn't take a lot of setup, I find these the easiest to play during the week or with friends that aren't that into board games (more complex games don't hold their interest). I Highly recommend it!

  I love this game. It is a fun game for players who like to play in teams. It is strictly a game of chance. There is little skill necessary and children as young as eight could play it comfortably. It does not involve any reading skills.  It is played on a board, with chips of different colors, using a deck of cards to determine where a chip is placed. It is a game where there can be a certain amount of socialization.

  I attended a game night at a friend's house and we ended the night with Sequence. It was my first time playing and I LOVED it. My BF and I are big into card games so this is right up my ally. I liked the game so much that I drunkenly bought it on my Lyft home. Two days later, I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived at my door.We now play this game at least once every other week. We are even teaching our two years old who has picked it up a lot faster than we expected. He doesn't understand strategy but he does like picking where his pieces go and LOVES when he blocks daddy.This has been by far my favorite drunk purchase.

I excused some of the features of the game as part of its Junior designation: activity cards often involve singing, acting, or expressing yourself. These are all nice group activities, but they don‚Äôt connect with the activity of playing a board game to me.Tired of Life Jr., I bought the ‚Äúregular‚Äù version only to find that the charades-like activities were part of this game as well. Also, it seemed as though all we accomplished was the exchange of money‚Äîit was constant ... and boring.

  Another prime deal so I think it was around $8. Great price.My family loves The Game of Life. This one is cute as you can get a dog or cat. The cards and board feel cheaper than the original game we have (early addition with the 3D houses). This one doesn‚Äôt have the 3D houses and the spinner attaches to a corner. That was my one gripe as it kept coming off which was just a bit irritating.The game is a little different than the others, like you don‚Äôt have to buy a house, and stock numbers are including with your career card. There are different paths for starting a family or not.My favorite part is on the action cards there are talking points. Like what type of car would you buy? Or describe your favorite amusement park ride. In a world full of technology and kids lacking the ability to day dream or create original ideas, I love this part. It starts a family dialog.The game was played in about an hour, with interruptions.  Our youngest player was 8.

  The quality of the game and materials is good. I gave it 3 stars because it is not like the original LIFE game. This version has been seriously 'dumbed down' for younger generations. There are weird cards that award you money for reasons that don't make sense (i.e. You are stranded on an island, collect $30k).  I got through the whole game and never got the chance to buy a house. The addition of pets is unnecessary. I will say the jobs are better than the original and are more relevant. I played with my dad and my 7 year old son. My son loved it but my dad wouldn't stop complaining. I originally bought it to help teach a group of adults on the autism spectrum about budgeting but this version is useless for that purpose. I found a remake of the original and bought that one to use as a teaching tool.

  This game is so much fun! That is why I gave it two stars instead of one.So why would I give it one star?1) THE SPINNER DOES NOT SPIN!  It is so poorly made, you can't get it to spin hardly at all, and the cardboard behind it with the colors and the red and black keeps sliding around and getting stuck no matter how many times we fix it.  Boo!  This takes away the fun!  Hasbro, get real - I'd rather pay an extra dollar for the game and get a working spinner.  This should be obvious!2) The came only comes with FOUR cars, and not in such great colors.  The Game of Life used to come with SIX cars, so not only could more people play, but even if only a few were playing, you had more colors to choose from.3) WHERE ARE THE BUILDINGS???  And the hill?????  They were so much fun, but Hasbro took them away.  Boo!4) This is subjective, but for ME, I prefer the action cards that *I* land on be for *me*.  I like the old life tiles, where the person who picks it up did something great and gets money, or did something awful and has to pay.  Now you get an action card and you pick someone else and have a spin-off, and sometimes they get paid from my action card.  That's no fun!  I think it's more fun when each person gets their own action cards that relate to them alone.  Like I said, this one is subjective.5) This one is also subjective, but the game was too short.  I think it should have been a little longer.

  Great update to the original.  The action cards have an extra little activity that you get to do. For example one card you visit the Great Barrier Reef and you have to describe a sea monster that you saw. Another card you show your skate boarding moves. The pets are fun. They did away the 3D pieces that would always pop out and make the board bulky except for the spinner.Cons: Still has the same spinner that rarely work right. Box has a  4"" hole where the spinner sticks out. You have to make sure all pieces are bagged so you don't loose them. The flow of money is ridiculous. I don't expect it to be realistic but maybe not so outrageous. You get paid 30k to go on a ski trip and you have to pay 10k when your pet eats your homework.All and all it is a great family game.

  Having not played the game in over 20 years, I was expecting updates. Some of the updates make sense. Jobs and action cards are more reflective of today's environment. But that's where the kudos end. They have found numberous ways to convelut the game. There are too many types of cards, adding confusing spaces on the board. I'm guessing this was an attempt to ""spice things up"". But it falls flat. Also, it's harder for younder kids and newbies to pick up. The biggest, and I mean biggest disappointment however is the spinner wheel. This was the funnest and defining attribute of the original game. In this version the spinner is uber cheap and very difficult to get a good spin. Anyone from the 80's remembers you could spin the wheel and it would go on for a long time. This one falls apart, and is near impossible to get a full spin. Granted the price is cheap, but I'd rather double the price, and get a quality game that could be passed down. Not a thrift store version of the original. Very dissatisfied.

Easy assembly since you don't have to place all of the buildings on before you play. I wish they would add $20,000 dollar bills back to the game again.

I would buy the classic version, which is the one that most of us grew up playing.

Good but not great game.

  I loved the concept. There are lots of small pieces so be careful with little children around. Also, that large spinner doesn't sit well on the board, keeps moving which is annoying. Those little cardboard circle pieces that are supposed to be put on that spinner don't stay in place when spinning and fall into the spaces between, so we don't put them on the spinner at all. With all these flaws, the kids like the game, but don't love it.

The Game of Life....not as I knew it!

  We bought this for my son for Christmas and he is HOOKED. There are many things I love about it (the addition of pets is awesome) but there are some things that just feel so much more complicated than the Life I knew as a kid. (The spinning for $200,000 and also choosing a number with your career that you have to remember to collect money for when it's spun!)All in all, it's still an awesome game (though we joked that they really needed to upgrade the cars to at least 7 seaters with all the pets and kids you now can get!!!!!!!!!!)

Kids love playing
","

  In our house, we like to play family games instead of our kids sitting on electronics all the time. Monopoly wasn‚Äôt the biggest hit, so I figured I‚Äôd try the Game of Life as a fun way to talk about money and the choices we make in life. The game moves so much faster than monopoly, so the kids stayed engaged. It was also more fun for them with the bright cards, the adding marriage and children, or going back to college, etc. This was a big hit in our house.

  Really wanted something like o remember when I was a kid. The spinner hardly spins. The cardboard piece behind the spinner moves around which becomes a problem for game play. When you spin the spinner it flies off the board. It attempts to be sequred to the edge of the board but that's laughable. The original I played in the 90s was secured to the board and always worked. We are not impressed with the new game play either. Not worth a buy.

When you spin, the red and black don't stay where they're supposed to and you can't put the coins on it for the spins because they don't stay.

Prefer older verision but still a stellar game

  You will probably think I'm super extra to thoroughly reviewing this game but I can't help it. I bought this because it was dirty cheap, coupon on top of a lightning deal on top of a sale, it was less than $5. Clue was one of my favorite games growing up, period(I even had a computer game version) I actually still have my old game (which I'm comparing to) but is missing the weapons an out of the clue sheets to track your clues so I figure what they hay and purchased this version.Boards are petty much the same, the rooms are the same, they have the same secret passages, only main difference is the new version is much brighter.Another difference you'll note is Mrs. White is no more, if I have to guess I might suggest her name was the reason for that...they now have Ochid.The rooms and weapons are the same. The character pieces are nooo fun. The pieces from the old game actually look like people, we use to fight over them as kids based on who they are, now I feel like they would just request their favorite color. Super lame. The character pieces is apparently a pretty big deal to me because for some reason this really upsets me that they are now just basic pawns.Obviously the cards are updated. More modern. They no longer have a yellow confidential envelope but instead a place one with a simple question mark on it.Game play has changed some as there are now ""magnifying glass"" option on the dice. If you roll them you get to pull a hint card. I hate change so I'm not a fan of it but I guess to stay relevant they do want to make some changes.All in all, clue is still a great game, this is a fully functional game, none of the pieces were missing, it was delivered on time, undamaged and unopened, price was fabulous, definitely a good game to play for older children or nerds on game night but I do prefer the old one to the new  everyone should own the game clue or play it in their life.

  I don't need to say anything about the game since I'm pretty sure many have reviewed and commented on it. I will focus on the game quality itself. I don't like how they are making the boards now, they fold it on two panels to make the box smaller. My issue with this is that when you open the board and lay it flat on the table, the crevices that are cut stick up from the table, making the board not been properly laid on the table. The cards it self-are very thin and cheap. The corners started to peel just after shuffling them a couple of times. I paid $11 here, but at the store, they have them for almost $20, not worth that price. Everything else in the game was good, I just wasn't too happy with the quality of the material.

  My grandchildren  and I have been enjoying playing the game out foxed. Which is sort of an easy clue game..  Even though it is for young kids even the 12 year old enjoys playing it.

This one is just like when I was young, except it has added some special cards that increased the fun,  Things that reveal an extra card now and then.  So we recommend this as a great family game with a long history of helping kids use deductive reasoning.That said,  we could not give this particular game 5 stars because 8 of our clue cards came with black ink smears that made them hard to read.

  I am more into modern board games (Descent, Pandemic) but when I saw this low price and an updated version of the old Clue I figured why not.  This is a fun, simple filler game or way to start of the game night.This is quite enjoyable as a two player game but I think it would be more fun to max out the player count if you can.  There is some strategy here in what you reveal to other players or what you don't reveal.  Careful note taking during the game is key.  I would like to see character miniatures instead of plain old pawns, but for $8 it's a steal.  I almost purchased the Star Wars version but seeing the play through on Dice Tower and reading how horribly broken that game is on Board Game Geek (although there is an interesting variant) I went with this version instead.

It‚Äôs simply a matter of deducing which cards are in the center of the board.I feel a little guilty about this rating, as I‚Äôm sure Clue is fun for children, and the more the merrier (it is essentially the interaction of the players and the beautiful graphics which creates these warm memories and not the challenges of the game itself). We only played the game once and gave it away to Good Will so children could enjoy itDr. Lucky:This review is on the card game not the board game. In spite of each having college degrees, we are not smart enough to play the Dr. Lucky card game. The written rules were very elusive: not what we were looking for. We want the game to be mysterious, not the rules. There is a lot of point taking, but what is the purpose since the winner is solely determined by whoever kills Dr. Lucky? So what difference does it make how many points you have? Fyi, Dr. Lucky is the only game we looked at in which the players determined the outcome of the game. The cards are beautiful and the writing clever.221B:Fabulous Game! Wonderful Sherlock Holmes ambiance and a classic feelI don‚Äôt know how anyone cannot enjoy this game, there is involvement, analysis, deduction, the moment the lightbulb goes off (the brain tease), player pay-off (or, as they say for books, the ‚Äúreader pay-off‚Äù), and only 2 players can play it and have fun!So there you have it, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.

  I remember playing Clue as a kid, and it was pretty fun even though we were almost certainly playing it wrong.  Now, picking up a copy for just a few dollars, this is a blast to play with my children.  Most of the familiar characters are there: Col Mustard, Prof Plumb... Mrs. White is missing, but there are some new faces as well.Yes, the theme is solving a murder mystery, but it's still very family friendly.  The outcome is selected randomly, but that doesn't make it any less fun when one of the people playing the game turns out to be guilty.  :-)If you are currently Clueless, I highly recommend picking up this game.

Not as cool as the classic version of the game.
","

  I debated whether to order this stripped-down, modernized version of the game or another, higher-end version of the game when I decided to get ""Clue"" for my kids.This set is okay, but because it's so basic, it doesn't ""set the mood"" for Clue nearly as much as some of the other versions do, and for that reason, it's less fun. Everything is just a bit plain. The grids on the board are just white. The player pieces are just little plastic bits like you'd find in a Sorry set. And so on.This game also adds a new innovation (extra Clue cards that have instructions on them, like showing some of your clues to another player) that I'm not a fan of. They're trying to make the game more ""hip"" or something‚ÄîI can absolutely imagine a bunch of people in an office meeting room with the boss saying, ""Okay, let's update all of our games to have a more 'Cards against humanity' feel, since that's what sells these days. For Clue, what should we add?""Point being... I don't like it. The point of Clue is to play with mystery and problem-solving and just a touch of murder Noir. It's a mood game. It's not a laugh-giggle-go-nuts-with-crazy-instructions party game. I pulled those cards out, I think they hurt the game rather than improve it.My advice‚Äîif you want to get Clue, spend another $10-$20 and get one of the better editions of the game with a nicer board and nicer pieces that can help to support the early century period, noir, semi-steampunk vibe of the game rather than making it feel so 'ironic dime store hip,"" which in my opinion just doesn't fit with the game's overall theme.Also‚Äîsince Amazon asked me to provide a ""Giftable"" rating for the game... I wouldn't get this edition for a gift, either. It would look fairly chintzy. This edition feels like a sub-$10 board game, which it is.

Loved playing Clue in the 80's, now my daughter loves it too
","

  I absolutely loved playing Clue as an 80's kid, so when my daughter mentioned that she plays it at school during inside recess I immediately bought this.  While I miss the original ""retro"" version this updated one is nice as well.  My kids really enjoy playing it and it's fun for our whole family--even though that sounds like a cheesy line from a commercial, it's true!  The one and only reason that I have dinged my review to 4/5 stars is because of the quality of the actual board.  It is a bit thin and flimsy and the way it folds into quarters, I can tell it will wear down fast, unfortunately.  It is nowhere near as thick and sturdy as the typical boards of the boardgames that fold in half rather in quarters.  I get that the manufacturers are probably trying to make the boardgame more compact and easy to store in a smaller, square box rather than the typical bigger rectangular boxes, but I'd rather have the longevity of the better made boards over perhaps slightly better storage.  I'm already thinking that in the near future I'll have to tape up this newer version flimsy board with clear packing tape when it starts falling apart.

Of course we also tried to throw each other off with misleading remarks and by making skeptical faces .  It never gets old!

  This is not a double sided game board - just the standard mansion (NO boardwalk on the reverse side). But for under $9 it‚Äôs still worth it for the price for a board game, I just don‚Äôt appreciate the false advertising.I do believe it has some differences from the original game I remember - there are optional clue cards (used when you roll a 1) that make 1 or multiple players reveal cards to others (which I guess moves the game along faster which could be good with inpatient kids) but you can also play without those cards.

  This was one of my favorite games growing up.  Since we are all home bound because of Covid, I was trying to add a few new games to our collection to help freshen it up.  We have a son that is 15 years old and a daughter that is 9 years old.  This has easily become their second favorite game ever!  Blokus is number one, and is also another Covid purchase.  Clue is great for many different ages, and we easily play four rounds in one sitting.  No regrets with this purchase!

  You can play classic Clue, this version with new Clue cards, or when you want to play a quick game, you can play by house rules like us. We have played the Classic version and removed the Clue cards. We have played with those cards. And in a hurry, we give one Clue card to each player per turn and if they roll the magnifying glass, they get those, too. Makes the game go fast but is still fun and challenging.

  This is just a slightly updated version of the original game. You can play the original way or with some new options. They replaced Mrs White with Dr Orchid and the cards/board has a modernized look.

So This is How Child Endangerment Starts

  My wife and I have gradually gotten more into board games, because we're old and lame and that's ok. She's a bit ... competitive, however, so even playing a game like Settlers can put me on the edge of the seat a little bit if I'm winning. Some of you know what I'm talking about. Board games kept popping up in my Amazon recommendations, and I kept seeing this one (nice work, Amazon ad algorythms). Cooperative? Sounds good!There went that Sunday. I even stopped watching football, BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE DYING IN ISTANBUL OR CONSTANTINOPLE. We played several games. We lost our first few, then kept winning. Our kids were annoying us with petty stuff like, ""Daddy, I'm hungry"" and ""Mommy, my toe fell off"" but sometimes you just have to tell your kids that now isn't a good time, because Daddy is building a research center and then has to fly to meet Mommy in Milan, and there is leftover ham in the refrigerator.I do question whether the game will keep its challenge. We've won our only two games on the hardest difficulty, but it felt suspenseful and like we could have lost, so I think it'll still be fun to play. Regardless, we've already gotten our money's worth out of this game. I think my daughter (six) will be able to learn it now or shortly as well, which will be cool and we can monitor her toe situation better.

The Fastest Way to Make Friends or Enemies

  This is one of the best board games I've ever played that features a team dynamic.  Unlike Settlers of Catan, which will ruin any and every relationship you ever had, this co-op will reveal the true colors of anyone daring to pick up a colored pawn. Play this game with a stranger to get to know them.  I promise that by the end of the game that you will know whether they will become your beast of a best friend forever or labeled a selfish, uncooperative squat head to be despised forever.  Try it on a first date.  It will foretell whether or not you and your interest will successfully spawn offspring together.After opening this box for the first time, my roommates and I spent countless nights trying to save the world.  As frustrating as it is to lose to a piece of cardboard, it is equally, if not more, gratifying to conquer your imaginary microscopic adversaries.  There are so many occasions where you end the game in despair wishing you had just one more turn. But when you win, you come away feeling like the hero of an apocalyptic movie, saving the world in the very nick of time! Needless to say, we are currently best friends changing the world via healthcare, the arts and non-profits.

  It seemed like we‚Äôd just started the game and the yellow strain had not only been cured but eradicated!  We were on the cusp of a cure for the second strain.  This one was in the bag.  We had weathered two epidemics so far without any egregious problems.  Sure there was a pair of cities in Eastern Europe that was in danger, but what were the odds that was going to be a problem?  One of us was already there.  Then another epidemic hit, the infection rate increased, three cities were drawn and it seemed the cascading outbreaks knew no bounds.  I think nearly everyone in Europe died that day, and we ‚Äì a group of specialized scientists- were served a plate of bitter defeat.  Again!  Again and again, always defeat.  Oh, the humanity!It‚Äôs true, I haven‚Äôt ever beat this rotten game and yet I keep coming back.  Because one day I‚Äôll win;  in spite of all the wounds to my pride I‚Äôve had to nurse, one day I‚Äôll ‚Äì I mean- we‚Äôll win.  I say we‚Äôll because this is a co-operative game where you all work together against those nasty strains of no-doubt-human engineered beasties.  Now, I know there are those of you who beat this every time you play, like I beat Shadows over Camelot every time I play, but I‚Äôve invited those sorts to come play with me and they can barely stand the shame of losing with me.To make it even worse, we only play with 4 epidemics.  I feel like I‚Äôm at an AA meeting:  ‚ÄúHi my name is Kyle.‚Äù‚ÄúHi Kyle‚Äù echoes the crowd.‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I suck at Pandemic.‚ÄùThis is the part where you put your arm on my shoulder and tell me it‚Äôs going to be alright.Game PlayThis board is a handsome map of the world; only instead of country boards you see in Risk there is a red web of interconnected cities.  Everyone starts in Atlanta were a research station is and you go from there.  Each player plays a scientist that has a special ability: one can move others on their turn, one can give cards to another without the restrictions other players have and so on.  The game also begins with 9 random cities around the world with varying degrees of infection (one to three stacked blocks).  If a city would have a fourth block put on it (called an outbreak), it actually stays at three and the cities connected by the red web get a block.  Isn‚Äôt that nice?  It‚Äôs called a cascading outbreak.  Such a pretty name.  If you get 9 outbreaks in a game you lose.  If you run out of blocks for a certain strain you lose, and if you haven‚Äôt cured all the strains before your white deck of cards runs out, you lose.  I hate to be a negative Nancy, but there‚Äôs a lot of ways to lose this game.  If, on the other hand, you are able to find cures for each strain, you win!How do you do that? Well you get someone who has got 5 cards of the same color in their hand to a research station, that‚Äôs how.  One of the players only needs four.Every turn each player gets to do four actions.  Picking up a cube off a city counts as one, so does moving between cities.  You can charter flights with your cards, rather than use them for cures.  You can build research stations and fly between those without expending a card, and a few other things.  Then you draw cards that you think will help you, but can instead turn out to be epidemics.  And you also draw cards for cities that get infected: usually this amounts to adding on square to the city‚Äôs pile.  As the game progresses, more cards are drawn at a time to be infected.  Oh, and when an epidemic happens, the cards for the cities that were infected get put back on the top of the draw pile.  Oh dear.I hate to tell you what to do because what do I know anyway?Those of you who beat this all the time should tell me what to do.  I understand that finding the cures is everything- lest you run out of time.  Others say, make sure that you never have three on on e city at a time, as to avoid outbreaks.Make sure that the medic is only clearing off stacks of infections, the dispatcher should be moving people so that don‚Äôt have to move themselves.Again, I never win, so what do I know?ThemeIf it hasn‚Äôt been obvious, I am completely sucked in by the theme.  There are similarities to other co-operative games especially Forbidden Island:  Each character has special powers, you make moves for the team and then the board pushed you closer to defeat, that sort of thing.  Forbidden Island also shares the shuffle the cards and put them back on top of the draw deck mechanic.  I tell you this so that you won‚Äôt be surprised if you decide to add them both to your game closet, this is why I haven‚Äôt added Forbidden Island to mine, though I‚Äôve played the game.  While this adds to the evidence that the theme could be stripped out of the game, I don‚Äôt recall cascading flooding going on in Forbidden Island, or feeling like humanity is hanging in the balance, or being glad I don‚Äôt live anywhere in Eastern Europe.  That is to say, I think the theme sticks.BalanceI read about people who win all the time and needed the expansion to rouse any concern in them.  But who can believe everything they read on the internet, I ask you?  Just because I‚Äôve never won though doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not an enjoyable experience, mind you.  Because I keep coming back.InteractionInteraction is very high.  There‚Äôs all sort of collaborative discussion that goes on through this game.Learning CurveLow.  It takes all of ten minutes to explain and there are directions on the board and the turn cards.DowntimeNill.  You are all in it together!  And you even get to move a guy in your turn.What‚Äôs not to Like?I actually know where some of these cities are on the map are but they all have these lines that go from the pin-pointed location to the circle where you actually place the blocks.  That remains a bit annoying even after playing the game 10 times.Collateral EndorsementMy four year old likes ‚ÄúThe one where they get sick‚Äù  We run around curing cities till the infection deck runs out.  He feels a lot better about himself than the rage I feel playing by the real rules.Actually, as I think about it, the first time I played this game I was at the home of some friends and I think we won.  But I‚Äôm certain I have not won with my copy of the game.  I‚Äôd say mine is jinxed, but we‚Äôve played on another friends copy and lost there too.  Also, I should say that a brother of mine lost two in a row and saw the writing on the wall in the third game and left the table, swearing off the game forever.  You might consider your own resiliency before buying this game.

  I love Pandemic. I originally picked it up because I got Pandemic Legacy for a very, very good price, and in the directions they tell you to play a few games of the original first to get your feet wet, so I bought it. This is probably one of my favorite games. I play anywhere from 1 to 4 players, while playing alone I'll play 2 rolls.Be warned, you won't win. Out of 17 games, I have a 29% win ratio on it. The game normally wins, but that is part of the fun of the game, when you win as a team it feels more of a victory.This is a co-op game, all players are on the same team and work together, and because of that, you can get the Alpha-Gamer in the group that tells you how things should be done, so just be aware of that. I've never had that occur, we all gives our onions and if needed vote.It is highly recommended that you also pick up the¬†

seriously addictive
","

  We spend several hours at a shot playing games, probably an average of once a week.  Some of our favorites: Settlers of Catan, Fluxx, Munchkin, Phase 10, Parcheesi, Sushi Go!, some of the Cheap-Ass games, just to give you an idea.We like having a variety of types of play to switch things up & keep us interested, but once in a while a game is simply addictive & we can play it over & over for hours.  Settlers is like that for us (even after many years).  And now Pandemic is, too.  We just can't stop playing!It's definitely challenging.  One of the great features is that you can increase the difficulty level once you start feeling like the game has become easy.  But don't judge that too fast, either.  There are so many factors that add variety to the game from play to play.  For example, the random assignment of a Role for each player means that your characters' combination of special abilities are different each game, so you need to adjust your strategy to take the best advantage of them.One reason I chose this is because feedback about playing with two players was positive.  Most of our games require at least the 3 of us to be any fun.  And pretty soon my son will be moving out, so we'll need some good two player games.  This weekend we got to test it with 2 people, and it was absolutely just as fun as with 3.  In fact, it surprised us because it required such a different strategy than with the 3 of us.  And once we adjusted and began winning at the lowest difficulty, we tried the next level and found we had to shift gears again. (And wow that level is tough)This is the first cooperative game we've owned, and we love that about it.  None of us is particularly competitive, so we find this a really nice change from the usual.  Maybe if we can stop playing this incessantly, we'll simply use it as a nice break between other games in a sitting.

  Bought it for  game night at my house in Seattle. It was stressful to learn, stressful to play.

Pandemic Board Game

OverviewPandemic is a cooperative game where you‚Äôre working together to cure diseases and prevent a worldwide pandemic.  If disease spreads too far, you lose.  If you find cures for all of the diseases and eradicate them you win.  There are multiple roles you and your team mates can play, each with unique powers that allow you to work around the rules in a specific way.Pros:There is a high sense of urgency and tension in the game.  Working against the game to win in time really draws you into the theme.The cooperative aspect of this game is great if you're not in the mood to play against your friends and family.  Playing as a team can create a great bond with the other players, especially when you get down to that last nail-biting turn.High level of difficulty and replay-ability, with rules to make the game harder once you've mastered the basic game.This game really makes you work together to win.  If everyone just does their own thing, you will lose for sure.  The rules even encourage discussion before making any actions.It really does an excellent job of making the game a challenging opponent.  The game's ""AI"", that is, the way you draw cards and spread the diseases through ""outbreaks"" means that the game is very difficult without requiring a player to make decisions.Cons:The game can be very hard, even on the easiest setting.  I have yet to actually win the game, even with six plays under my belt.Be prepared to lose the first few plays.Mood: Thinky, Cooperative, Strategic

  This is a great cooperative board game to play with your friends or gaming group.I've played this with many different groups of people now and every experience was positive and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves very much while playing.  Having a great cooperative game in your rotation is a good way to get people who don't like the competition aspect of games to be able to enjoy themselves too.The game itself is fairly easy to get the hang of after a few turns and allows for great strategy sessions where you work together to eradicate the various diseases on the board to trigger the win condition.  Playing at maximum difficulty will generally be pretty challenging and will require good planning and communication with the other players in order to succeed.This is one of those games that is tough to win, but tends to make people want to play ""just one more time, I know we'll get it this time"".  It's that enjoyable.  This one tends to be a favorite in our board gaming group, and we keep bringing it out time and again.The only issue that I have with the game set is that the instructions aren't the easiest to read if you want a quick summary of win conditions and such.  I had to read them a couple times to figure out some of the more nuanced game rules and situations that tended to come up quite a bit more than expected.No other issues to this really fun game.Highest Recommendation.

Is there a doctor in the house?
","

  I was originally introduced to this game by a student of mine, who had been working with me on disease modeling.  After reading some of the great reviews of the game, my wife and I decided to purchase it last year.  We can't say enough how much we enjoy playing this game; it makes you think, and, more importantly, you have to work together!My wife and I love playing board games, but some of our board games can get fairly competitive and, in some cases, can leave bad feelings afterward (we don't play trivia games anymore because of this!).  If you've had these feelings, then Pandemic is the game for you:  You don't compete against each other, but against the game board.  This means, you can talk, you can share information, and you can strategize together openly.  And, if you win, it's a strong sense of accomplishment; if you lose, you can always try again!To the game itself:  We love the quality of the pieces (sturdy plastic for the disease cubes and game pawns, well-made cards that have withstood numerous plays and shuffles, and a very sleek game board and box!), but we especially love that it's a different game every time.  Each of you randomly selects your role, giving each of you a special ability that can help your team.  You then randomly place disease cubes on the board, and then start trying to find cures.  Sometimes, you get lucky, and you can discover cures quickly, but, other times, epidemic cards come up so quickly that you don't know what hit your team!  Admittedly, the first few plays are slow, because there are a lot of rules to keep track of.  But, after a few plays, you really get the hang of it, and, since you are working together, you can help each other learn the game.  We've found that a typical game takes around 30-45 minutes, which is a good length of time.Finally, I'll say that one other thing we really like about this game is you can adjust the difficulty:  make it easier by putting in less epidemic cards or laying your hands on the table so everyone can see, or make it harder by adding in more epidemic cards and/or playing with expansion packs.  Some other rule changes to make the game more challenging are included in the main rules.The few complaints we have had about the game are that the game is only for 2-4 players (more requires an expansion pack), so, if your family or board game group is large, keep this in mind.  Also, although the game is cooperative, it is hard!  We're currently on a streak where we haven't won a game in weeks, but I'm hoping we'll save humanity soon enough!Anyway, if you've been growing sick (he he he) of the ""standard"" board games, give this one a try.  It was our first venture outside of ""standard"" board games, and Pandemic is why we now own Ticket to Ride and Forbidden Island, and are looking at Settlers of Catan.  This coming from people who started out with Monopoly, Clue, and Life!

  Omg I went to Costco today for t.p. and couldn‚Äôt get any because they were all out because people are getting crazy about the Coronavirus... buying up t.p., bottled water, flour, hand sanitizer, etc. like crazy. It was bonkers like first episode of your favorite apocalypse tv show where they set up the disaster. I came home and looked at this game sitting on the floor from Xmas, still unopened. I realized we might be playing it soon when we‚Äôre all stuck at home because the plague arrives, and thought that was pretty ironic. Maybe if it gets real bad there‚Äôs paper pieces we can use for t.p.

Felt a little one-dimensional, did not want to play again
","

  This game reminds me of playing Risk as a child.  There are ""certain things you have to do"" but the role each player has is rather limited and you will end up finding yourself pigeonholed to ""bring all the cards"", ""cure all the people"", or generally running around (or maybe staying put) to keep doing one same thing.  Which is one reason I left the corporate world, I found this boring.  I'd rather have a dozen different problems to solve in any week, rather than being able to do the same thing every day with my eyes closed.  In some ways this reminds me of Forbidden Island - co-operative, assume a particular role, but for some reason I find that game more engaging and enjoyable where I didn't want to play again with this one.  Other games I have tried recently, and enjoyed, were Qwixx, Spell Smashers, and the charmingly named Rat-a-Tat-Cat!

Fantastic co-operative fun
","

  My friends and I play tabletop games and other, more advanced head-to-head board games like Risk and Axis & Allies, so we are generally familiar with rule sets and games in general.  This had been recommended to me by Amazon for literal years, but I had always hesitated.It went on a good black friday sale price, and I pulled the trigger because so many people in public forums have compared other games back to this.  I wish I would have done it sooner.Our first game was our longest, as we followed the included rule book carefully and in a procedural manner.  I'm told this is an improved version of the original, but I will say I wish the rulebook was more explicit to what causes an ""outbreak"" but we were able to figure it out by playing.  A simple line I wish was stated specifically:Outbreaks:  These occur if any city that already has 3 infection markers on it gets another infection marker.  Follow the outbreak rules section when this happens.Once we had a grasp of the rules, my group (all adults in our 30's) VERY quickly got into the strategy of the game, and the discussions of what to do next was exciting and rapid.  We loved being on the same side for once, working against the deck.  Our first game we won almost easily, the second we made harder with 5 epidemic cards instead of 4, and despite some solid effort, we lost!  I like this that way, if we could easily win every time we would get bored quickly.  The loss left us wanting to go again, but we were out of time.First game took us about an hour and 15, but our second game was much much faster.  Probably closer to 40 minutes.The overall rules are simple enough that I would say kids can definitely grasp it after a few play thru's.  This game has been very addicting for us, we may clear our schedules of other games for a while.  It's also expandable from official sources, which I'll be looking into, and if you are good at game design you could add a few things yourself without breaking it.

Fun, Addictive Game Without Competition
","

  It's a co-op game - you fight the board, not each other, and I love that, especially in a family that is full of competitive people. The more people you have playing it can be a really long game. Although it's co-op you don't have to share your cards with everybody and let them know what you have. Before you start the game, you may want to make it clear to everybody else that the game consists of teamwork, but nobody is leader. I know there can be some forceful personalities; it sucks the fun out of the game when people are telling you what to do, and you feel like it's not even really your turn, but their turn nonstop with your character.There's three ways to die, so that makes it fun! You're in a hurry to figure out how to survive. Some rules are unclear and confusing. Look online, and there's a lot of people there to clarify the rules. The first time I played it was with two friends. We misunderstood a lot of the rules and went all over the place, and even changed rules in the middle of turns, to try to sort it out better. It wasn't a proper game at all, but it was loads of fun, and we won right before there were no cards left to draw. My friends also have this obsession with the asian character guy, so they always hope and pray they get him when we mystery pull character roles. And no, they've never pulled him. I did once. They hated me. :)

Told the Kids it was Government Issued During COVID-19
","

  The game is a bit sophisticated and difficult to remember all the rules, but it‚Äôs a great game and for anyone who is accustomed to board games it‚Äôs bound to be a favorite. It‚Äôs a strategy game, which means you have to be on top of it, and my guess is it‚Äôs one of those games that you‚Äôll get better at if you play it several times or even on the regular. I don‚Äôt do anything regularly (except maybe work and exercise and cook) so it‚Äôs hard to get good at something/anything if you only do it every few weeks. But here we are in an actual pandemic and so I thought it might be fun and relevant to play a board game called pandemic. And funny thing, amazon was only delivering essentials and this came right along with my bulk lentils and rice and well in advance of my TP & PT. So we decided to tell the kids that it was government issued by trump and that moving onto the next grade depended on whether they beat it, and they didn‚Äôt beat it and then the kids stressed out and I am a tiny bit concerned that could be considered psychological abuse given the circumstances. I think they‚Äôre over it, or maybe not, since according to their Dad one of them was obsessing over an assignment on his iPad outside in the rain during a nature walk. Homeschooling is strange. So are daytime pajamas & Zoom dress codes. My honey and I are about 2 for 3 in our winning of this game, so maybe we will get one of those $1.2M stimulus checks that some folks are getting if they had an AGI over $1M last year. It does kick us up a notch in some way I‚Äôd think, but I‚Äôll have to call Fauci to know for sure.

Great cooperative game for 8yrs and up.
","

  I picked this up in 2016 as a Christmas gift for my 13 year-old daughter.  I was trying to  introduce my family to some new board games in an effort to get the kids to spend less time on video games.  Pandemic was a hit with my daughter, my 9 year-old son, and myself (unfortunately, my wife refuses to play those ""weird games"").I can't add much more than others have already said.  However, since my family was new to cooperative games and this style of game expected that we might have problems understanding the rules which might cause short-attention-span kids to quickly lose interest.  To alleviate that I purchased the iPad version and played a few times myself prior to gifting Pandemic to my daughter.  It ended up being a great decision on my part and we were able to start paling relatively quickly.  I mentioned, we all enjoyed it and my daughter prefers it to ""Forbidden Island"" and ""Ticket to Ride.""  I enjoy all three, and my 10 year-old son prefers cooperative games such as this.The only downside is that the ""cooperative"" component sometimes turns into an ""argumentative"" component when there's more than one strong-willed player who thinks their strategy is the best.

A Great Gateway Game
","

  Pandemic is legendary. It's tense, but it's a lot of fun. This is a great game for 2 to 4 players, but you can also play it solo by controlling more than one of the character roles.Your mission is to cure epidemic breakouts of four different types of disease before they spread out of control. You work together with other types of medical professionals to travel the world learning how to treat and ultimately cure the diseases.Pandemic is one of my favorite ""gateway"" games. A gateway game moves a non-gamer toward becoming a gamer. Or introduces someone who has only played mass market games like Monopoly or Clue to the world of games that are actually good. Pandemic is also a good introduction to cooperative gaming, where all the players work together as a team to beat the game rather than competitively trying to beat each other.This has become my wife's favorite game. She loves it because it is challenging but not impossible to beat, it is quick and easy to set up and put away, and 2-player games last anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes. Whenever we pull it out (which is frequently) we normally play it two or three times.Pandemic has inspired many other similar games, but it remains a classic. Highly recommended.

Co-op game that makes you think
","

  Pros: High quality components, challenging, requires strategyCons: Can be too random, one person can take over if you're not carefulExcellent cooperative game. I got this to play with my girlfriend, and we've played with our families and some friends as well. It is very easy to teach since you're all on the same team, so you can show people how to play as you play. It also lets you choose how difficult you want it to be by letting you decide how many Epidemic cards you add to the player deck. When these are drawn, they will make you infect more cities each turn and they will cause all the cities you have already infected to be shuffled and placed back on top, so they will keep getting more disease added to them. The more Epidemic cards there are, the harder the game gets because this happens more often.It requires a lot of foresight and strategy if you want to win, as you always have to be aware of what cities are potentially going to be drawn, and if you get close to the end you need to remember that there are only a set number of turns. Each player has a different ability that they can use, so we have found that it can be easier to play with more people, as this gives you access to more abilities. However, in the games I have played, we have both won and lost with 2, 3, and 4 people playing. It can certainly be tough depending on the game.And that's why I'm rating it 4 stars. I really like the game, and, as a side note, the physical game itself is outstanding. The box is very sturdy with spaces inside for all the pieces and cards. The cards are sturdy and the player pieces and ""disease cubes"" are all beautiful (everyone comments on how nice the components are). However, the game play can vary greatly. Sometimes you'll win easily, sometimes you'll win at the last second, sometimes you'll get crushed early, sometimes you'll lose just when you think you've won it. This can be a good and bad thing. I like that there's no way to ""figure it out"" and win every time, but it would be nice if it wasn't as random. (I suppose you could decide where to put the Epidemic cards in the deck, but we haven't tried that.) I played with my brother once and we won very easily, and now he's convinced that it is too trivial.All in all, I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging co-op game.

  SO my husband and I really like playing games together. We try to find a lot of games that work for only 2 people playing. Since we started having babies, our social life just is not a thing. So we just have each other and if it requires more than 2 we can't play. We really had enjoyed the game forbidden dessert! Seriously loved it. And then because we were so into that we stumbled upon this one and its the same line of game. Just different moving parts and more parts so it takes the game play up a level!We have decided that over the years it is better for my husband and I to not do competitive games! We can't to heated and neither are very good at losing. (We are working on this though so the kids learn its ok to lose) So BONUS! This is a cooperative game. Not going against each other but the board. So it is a house full of harmony then! lol... as for all other games we just stopped taking score haha

First Serious Board Game in Years
","

  I've only recently gotten on the bandwagon to the return of board games, but I didn't know where to jump on. I wanted a cooperative game, so those I play with will be more inclined to join in, and Pandemic was at the top of many lists of that category. It's fun yet challenging, with loads of replay-ability. We've only played a dozen or so times, losing more than half of those, but we don't feel discouraged in another go at curing diseases.Having said that, although I still consider myself an amateur at this game, I feel too much success/failure depends on which characters you draw. Some amazing combinations can be made with whichever ones are drawn, but some are definitely better than others, and too much time can be spent deciding on how to coordinate each move rather than simply enjoying the game... that's likely due to those playing overthinking everything though.Either way, I highly recommend this game, even to newbies like myself!

I love my wife so why do I always want to ...
","

  When I first saw this game I had never actually heard of cooperative games. I read a bit about the concept and I thought to myself that it all seemed a bit pointless ‚Äì playing games is about winning and how do you win if you don‚Äôt have someone to beat? I know that solo games such as solitaire are geared towards beating the system, but to me that‚Äôs because you don‚Äôt have a human to go up against (and ideally mash). I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one whose family background was board games when it rains, with a win at all costs attitude instilled at an early age ‚Äì it‚Äôs just what you did!But then I thought about it. I love my wife so why do I always want to pulp her when we bring out the old favourites? I thought to myself that it might be a better idea if we face things together, a kind of extension on how couples are supposed to be. So I bought Pandemic as a Christmas present for her (me!), not knowing very much about it at all or if we would enjoy it. But hey, need to shop for present: box ticked!We took our time learning the rules, but they aren‚Äôt too hard to grasp and we played a few easier levels and then dived into the toughest one. When we lost there was no finger pointing and when (if!) we won it was a very affirming experience for us as a team. I really have to recommend this game; it‚Äôs given me a taste for an unexpected evolution in game development and now I‚Äôm looking at other things out there too.But we still play the old stuff like Ludo and Risk, and she still hammers me in chess‚Ä¶

Best game EVER!
","

  Okay, to start out, I love love LOVE Pandemic!  I admit it, I'm a bit competitive.  I hate losing games.  I'm generally fine with competitive games where the best strategist (or luckiest) wins, but I really dislike games (like Settlers of Catan) where some players can gang up on others.  You pretty much don't have a chance when every other player is specifically playing against YOU.  Pandemic is fantastic because you cooperative with the other players and you all win or lose together.  I just absolutely love sitting at the table talking about all our options and strategizing together.My son introduced me to Pandemic several months ago, and I was hooked.  We've spent several afternoons/evenings playing again--and again--and again.  On many occasions when I am home alone, I play all by myself (playing two roles), and we've also played four players on several occasions.With two players and four epidemics, we win every time.  With five epidemics, we win about 70% of the time.  We've tried six epidemics a couple times, but have not been able to beat that game yet.  Still trying!  Ugh!  As you increase the number of players, the game gets more difficult.  With four players we've only played with four epidemics, and we win probably a little over half the time.  I honestly think it would be impossible with four players and six epidemics, but someone has probably proven me wrong.We've even discovered another way to lose the game, which is not listed in the rule book!  It says you can lose by having too many outbreaks, running out of disease cubes, or running out of player cards.  We've lost in all those lovely ways.  However, a couple of times, we've had only a few outbreaks, had plenty of cubes of each color left, and plenty of player cards.  Three diseases cured, with only one to go.  One of those times, we'd even gotten through all the epidemics, so there were none left in the infection deck!  We've got it made, right?  Uh, no.  Turns out we discarded too many of the same color city cards, and there were only four left total, including in our hands and in the player deck.  Neither of us was the Scientist, so that was an automatic loss.  This is a danger when you get dealt a nice hand at the beginning, say two or even three of the same color.  You decide to collect those, so when you discard, you are discarding the other colors.  If you happen to keep drawing you ""discard"" color and it takes too long to collect the color(s) you want, you've now discarded too many of the other color and you don't have enough left at the end to cure the disease.  Beware.We have also managed to lose the game on the very first turn.  We were very unlucky drawing the infection cards when setting up the game:  three on Karachi and Delhi, and two on Kolkata.  Our first player did not have any way to get to that location to do even a little treating, and the first card drawn from the player deck was an epidemic.  After resolving the epidemic, the first card drawn was Delhi, which caused a double outbreak (Delhi/Karachi) and put the third cube on Kolkata.  The second card drawn was Kolkata, which was a triple outbreak (Kolkata/Delhi/Karachi) and lost us the game as there weren't enough disease cubes.  Yep, lost on the very first player card drawn and there was not a single thing we could do about it.One slight change we sometimes make in the game is to draw 10 cards at the beginning instead of 9.  The first nine infect the cities, and the tenth is where we place our player pawns and the first research station.  It adds a level of difficulty to the game to not always start in Atlanta.  We were noticing before that we always seemed to get in trouble with black and red, and we believe it was because all our players started so close to blue and yellow so those cities were easy to get to and treat.  Now that we can start anywhere on the board, blue and yellow have become equal opportunity killers.There are a few things it is easy to get wrong.  When the infection rate moves up, it's easy to forget to start drawing three cards (or four) since you're so accustomed to the lower number.  It's also easy to forget to discard, not noticing that you have more than 7 cards in your hand.  One scenario we've encountered a few times involves having 8 cards for literally a second.  You meet another player on top of a research station, and share knowledge by pulling that city card from her.  You now have 8 cards in your hand, but 5 of one color.  Your very next action is going to be curing a disease, which will leave you with only 3 cards.  But, before you cure that disease, you have 8 cards, so we think you have to discard one even though literally on your next action you will be discarding 5 cards.  This is a little frustrating, but the rules specifically say that if you EVER (my emphasis) have more than 7 cards in your hand, you must discard (or play an event card).We were also a little confused by the role of the Researcher the first time we played.  To be clear, when the Researcher shares knowledge, she and the other player must be on the same city, and the card can only go FROM the Researcher TO the other player (on either player's turn, as an action).  She cannot take a card from the other player (and they cannot give one to her), unless it matches the city they are sitting on.It is also extremely easy to forget to infect cities after resolving an epidemic.  You've spent a bunch of time resolving, then strategizing based on where the board stands now, and you completely forget that you still have to infect before going to the next player.Lastly, you are not supposed to choose your roles.  We played with one person who had played before, and he said they always choose which roles they want.  I suppose you can play that way if you want, but the game would be far less interesting because people would probably tend to choose the same roles every time.  The instructions say to shuffle the role cards and deal them to each player -- that means they're supposed to be random.  It's far more interesting and challenging when the roles change every time.  A good part of the strategy is figuring out how to maximize the advantages that each role gives you in any given game.Pandemic is basically figuring out exactly how much effort you have to spend in each game sharing knowledge in order to cure diseases versus preventing outbreaks, all while maximizing the strategic use of whatever role you are playing.  Spend too much time on one, and the other will get you.  Sometimes you just have to say ""oh well"" and let an outbreak happen, even when you could have prevented it.  It may just be more important to get to that one city in order to share knowledge than to get to the city where the outbreak is about to happen in order to prevent it.  However we do try hard to prevent double outbreaks because things can get very bad very quickly when that happens.Okay I've rambled enough.  If you're on the edge, buy this game!  It's awesome.  Every game is different and it never gets boring.  It is equally fun with two or more players, although the more players, the more challenging it is.  You can control the difficulty level by player with fewer or more epidemic cards.  A+

Game is fun and interesting. Good 2 player game
","

  I have found the game to be fun and interesting. At the learning stage of the game, it took a bit of time to figure out how to play it. There was just a lot of steps and rules. There is a lot going on in the game. It seemed a bit confusing a first. Once I got into the swing of things, it was not so bad.I like how you can get different roles each time one plays the game. It makes it more interesting. It has different challenge levels too. This is a fun game with two players. I think 3-4 players make it more challenging as well. Since it is a co-op game, an extra player hand can be made if there is only 2 players.The thing I do not like is that it took me a while to get used to the game. There is a lot going on. It makes sense why there are reference cards to give to the players. I got used to it after the second game. The other thing is to win the game is to cure all the diseases. I think it would be more fun to be able to eradicate all the diseases. It would also make the playtime longer though if that was the case. The other thing is I do not like how one of the ways to lose is when the entire player deck is gone. It feels like it shortens the playtime a bit, especially if I am into the game and want to continue playing to see if I can cure everything before I get to many outbreaks, which is another way to end the game,

... over the last year and Pandemic has been the best addition to my slowly growing collection
","

  I have been playing more and more board games over the last year and Pandemic has been the best addition to my slowly growing collection. Working with my friends and family instead of against them was a great change of pace after years of royal rumble style board gaming. This game is just as fun to play with 2 people as it is with several more and no two games of Pandemic are the same. It is just as easy to lose this game as it is to win and losing only makes me want to play it again. I have begun to purchase the expansion sets and each new update only makes the game more entertaining and fun. That being said, the original game is extremely replayable and worth every penny. For the dedicated tabletop player, or the family looking to play infrequently, this is a must buy game!

One of those rare fun 2-player coop games that doesn't get boring
","

  My boyfriend and I just can't play competitive games against each other. They always end with one of us gloating and the other glowering, muttering profanities under their breath. So, we decided that we'd try to find a good cooperative game. Unfortunately, good two-player coop games are tough to come by.That's why we're so happy to have found Pandemic. It's you against the board WITH your partner (up to four people). The game is really easy to catch on to; after playing through the first few moves, we both got the hang of it. You definitely don't need to be a hugely experienced boardgame player to enjoy it.There are tons of small parts and nuances to each game, so I do recommend limiting the game to 10 years old and up. Expect your first game to last 90 minutes with the learning curve, but that time will quickly reduce to an hour or so after you understand how to play the game. Set up takes five minutes.Overall, the game is replayable and thoroughly enjoyable. My boyfriend and I are both not super great at it (yet), but I would much rather be conquering this game WITH him than tearfully conceding another game TO him. At least, now, I have a chance.

Well, while purchasing one of my latest TTR expansions I stumbled upon the Pandemic games; which are similar to the TTR ones in that you start with a base game, get the foundation for rules and game play and then you start moving on to expansions with additional features.  I purchased Pandemic and with Amazon Prime it was delivered in less than 24 hours, no kidding!  As is my usual custom I read the instruction manual and then because I am a visual learner I went to You Tube to watch some videos.  ZManGamesOfficial does a 9.5 minute brief tutorial.  WatchItPlayed does a wonderful job walking you through the game prep for a 2-player game including where all pieces, cards, etc. go.  This was very helpful as there are specific instructions on how to shuffle and stack the Player Cards.  My niece and I had this video up while setting up the first game.  Finally, I watched Geek & Sundry do their TableTop version of the game where you actually get to see the players play.  They have an abbreviated video and then a 1.5 hour extended game play.  So, these are just tips that helped us get an understanding of the game play and we had a blast!Pandemic allows you to travel from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and you travel throughout the world trying to cure and eradicate 4 diseases.  The instructions make it sound so easy but oh boy; it is not.  Game play can be learned in about 15-30 minutes.  The difficult part and it is not the actual game-play; is trying to come up with enough strategies fast enough to cure and eradicate the diseases before you and your team die!  Yes, team...unlike TTR this is not a game 1 player wins.  It's a collaborative game in which all players work together...you discuss how you can unite forces, share your special roles, your cards, etc.  But be careful of an alpha player who may start bossing people around, telling them what to do and takes charge of the game. If you get an alpha player just let them have the game board, pawns, etc. and tell them to play the game by them self but as if they were many players.  In the end if it's your turn you can listen to others, even the alpha player, but what you do is totally up to you.  If you don't have a good strategy everyone loses...my niece and I call it dying because we have succumbed to the disease.So, why is it a race against the clock?  Well, no matter how well your strategy, your team can ""die"" IF you: Have 8 outbreaks before curing/eradicating all 4 diseases, you run out of Disease Cubes or Player Cards. Note: You don't have to eradicate all 4 diseases to win; you just have to cure all 4. First game we cured all 4 diseases and eradicated the yellow (""Crazy Banana Disease"") but we got 8 outbreaks...we saved the world!  2nd game; yes, we played another because we were feeling lucky!  We cured all 4 diseases, didn't eradicate any and once again we saved the world.  We named our diseases the Black Zombie Plague, Purple People Eater (Blue cubes), Angry Bird Virus (red) and of course the Crazy Banana Disease (yellow) because my niece named it while infecting Miami.During your turn you can play up to 4 actions, draw 2 Player Cards but you cannot be holding more than 7 at any given time and then you MUST infect cities!  The Infection Rate starts at 2 cities per player, per turn.  But every time a player draws an Epidemic Card they have to move the Infection Rate marker and it slowly increases the Infection Rate from 2 cities up to 4 cities.  The Epidemic card also requires you to draw 1 city from the bottom of the Infection cards and you must infect that city with 3 disease cubes; 1 more cube of the same color and you have an outbreak, oh my!  Finally, the Epidemic Card requires you to ""intensify"" the Infection Cards. That means you must shuffle all the Infection Cards (cities) that have been played since the last epidemic, including the city card you just drew from the Infection Card pile and then put them back on top of the Infection Card pile so they now go back into play.  See the intensity?  With just my niece and me playing we didn't have as many cards to reshuffle so we kept infecting the same cities; which in essence was then producing outbreaks faster.  I ""think"" you may have a longer game play with more people because then the other players will also be contributing cards.An outbreak occurs if/when a city accumulates 4 of the same color disease cubes. When this happens you must put a disease cube of that same color in every city that is directly attached to the city that the outbreak occurred in, thus, the epidemic.  Note: It's possible that you have infected a city with more than 1 disease so IF you have 4 or more disease cubes but they are different colors you do NOT have an outbreak.  The outbreak is only when you get 4 of the same color in the same city but the 4th cube (same color) will not be placed on the city.  So watch those disease cubes and treat and cure so you can prevent the outbreaks.Now when you play up to 4 actions during each turn you have an option to treat a disease.  You treat by removing 1 or more disease cubes from the city you are in (each cube being an action) that you have used your actions and/or role to get to.  I was the Medic during first game and one of my roles allowed me to remove ALL disease cubes from the city I was in or traveled to!  The Dispatcher can move players from city to city with their permission so once again...If you have a Dispatcher in the same game with a Medic you can move the Medic to the city that needs to be treated and get rid of all the disease cubes.  IF the disease has been cured (see above pic...the disease markers are solid colors and moved above the disease logos) then you get to remove ALL the disease cubes in that city EVEN IF you aren't the Medic.  To eradicate the disease you must remove ALL disease cubes of the same color from every city on the board.  When you have eradicated the disease you flip the disease marker over to reveal the little log for eradicated.  Note: Cities can still be infected if the disease has been cured but NOT if it has been eradicated.Back to the outbreaks.  There's also an outbreak chart with marker and each time an outbreak occurs you have to move the marker.  If you have 8 outbreaks the game is over and there is no winner because everyone has died.  You also have Research Stations and these are nice because there is one action that allows you to shuttle from station to station and that can get you closer to an infested area to have a chance to treat, cure and/or eradicate several or all cities.  There are also Role Cards and pawns to match the color of your role.  Each role has special duties that only that player can perform (see above with Medic and Dispatcher).  You don't get to choose your color/role.  Pandemic is for 2-4 players and there are 6 Role Cards so you won't have all 6 roles in game play at the same time.  There is another extension that adds a 5th player.I know there is a lot more that can be said and I or someone else can try to answer your questions.  I just played for the first time last night (4/13/19) and while playing the 2nd game I came to Amazon and we read descriptions for some the expansions.  I immediately ordered Pandemic: The Cure--Experimental Meds and then about 2 hours later I ordered Pandemic: State Of Emergency (this introduces diseases/infections from animals). So as you can see this is how pleased I was with Pandemic and yes, we are still playing TTR...I will be posting some more reviews on those as well because I currently have 9 versions.I think I got infected with a board game virus but hey, what can I say; my family/friends still love games the old-fashioned way...totally unplugged, board games and card games around the table.  On a side note I must share what happened during our game.  My daddy called and my sister held the phone out so he could hear my niece and me playing.  We had one part of the map covered and ready to explode with black Disease Cubes.  My niece was trying to tell me how I could (as the Medic) take care of all the blacks.  She said, ""Auntie, if you just get rid of all the blacks we won't die!  Can you just take care of all the blacks over there?"" and she pointed to the area that was well infected AND we were trying to treat/cure some the disease so that we could remove some the black Disease Cubes off the board and continue game play.  Later I dropped a Dorito on the map and I told my sister, ""Shay-Bo, I think I just killed everyone in Moscow because a large UFO has landed on them.""  We are a Christian family that doesn't drink, smoke, etc.  We just like to have good clean fun but I told my family if anyone was a fly on the wall during our game play they would have been questioning our integrity.  We have already planned our next family game day for Good Friday and yes, it will be good!!

A classic, beloved co-op game
","

  Super fun to play with friends and definitely challenging. Pandemic is one of the most highly-rated board games around, and it lives up to the expectations. It offers strategic depth, a bit of random chance, and a compelling narrative to follow. It's also well balanced -- you can win if you do things right, but you'll lose a lot figuring out how to do so. Highly recommended for anyone new to board games or curious about co-op games in general.Pandemic Legacy is also pretty cool, but I'd say this is the better starting point. If you're going into Legacy, it's better to understand the core fundamentals of how to win at Pandemic as losing in Legacy has repercussions that reverberate through future games.

This game is hard
","

  It a fun game where you and your friends work together to save the world.  The only thing I do not like about the game is the ending.  You spend about 45 min, but the game ends when you cure all the infections.  If you do manage to win, you still got a game board full of colors cubes.  I kind of wish the game came with more player cards to help the game go on longer and have the end be when you exterminated all infections vs just cure them.  Now this is a board game, so there nothing stopping you from just reshuffle the player deck and keep going until you clear the board.Over all it still a fun game and I highly recommend anyone to try it.  I find the game easier with 2 people and gets harder the more people you play with,  even wtih just 2 people the game is not easy.

Awesome Intro to Game Night
","

  My boyfriend and I just started doing game nights and this has been a game changer (pun intended). He actually can't wait for ""no netflix night"" and usually suggests we play this game.- It's a great cooperative style game. This is awesome for really competitive people who might want to play it a little safer and not risk tensions running too high.- It takes a while to learn. Some of the rules are not as readily apparent from the rule book, and your first game might take a while understanding all of it. For instance, our first game we thought the objective was to eradicate, but it's just to cure (multiple beers may have been involved tbh). Be patient and it'll seem second-nature after 1-2 games.- Fun balance of strategy and luck. I'm not a big fan of pure luck games, mainly because I have none. Some people might like that thrill. But I do like strategizing and coming up with (diabolical) game plans. This is a nice bit of both.- It's not easy to win. That's part of what makes it so fun. It's addicting because you might get so close, but come up short. Took us 5 games on the ""easy"" level to finally win.- Great for 2 or more people. We like games we can have fun with just the two of us (i.e. if you have no friends), or if you invite others. It's also nice because the pace of game-play does allow outside conversation, so you can interact with your friends on a game night, not just immerse in the game and not talk for hours.

Helped kids with their fears about the current pandemic!
","

  This is a very smart, very well thought out cooperative game that can be adjusted in difficult level.  I highly recommend it, despite the current circumstances, or perhaps especially in the current circumstances.  My kids conquered their fears about our pandemic when we played this game, and learned that many different professionals work together in cooperation to combat a virus.  They wanted to play it again and again, each time gaining confidence from beating the pandemic.  As an added plus, kids also learn the location and population density of many cities around the world.  Highly recommend!

Super impressed. The board quality itself is really nice
","

  I just received this the other day.  I want to say I am impressed with the quality.Starting with the box itself, I am very impressed. I've never got a board game before that was such heavyweight chipboard box.  Then the photo paper covering the box is very detailed, and rich full of color.  Lovely texture and coating on the box.  Super impressed.The board quality itself is really nice, looks, great!I like the clear plastic disease cubes, they are pretty crystal clear and to me it's more exciting and not as monotonous as the wooden ones that came  with the first edition.  I wouldn't of minded wooden pawns but I am not complaining.. they are fairly heavy plastic and polished a bit -- same with the research center tokens.Card quality is very nice.  Air cushioned and seems like they'd hold up.  I've already sleeved the player deck.  I might not sleeve the infection deck.  If it ever becomes a problem (I can always sleeve them later).

Easily one of my favorite games of all time!
","

  There is a bit of a learning curve with this game, but don't let that deter you. My 9-year-old niece got the hang of it in one playthrough with my teaching her, and my family of widely varying ages really enjoys this game. Pandemic is suitable for both casual and serious gamers, ages 8+.I absolutely love this game! I love the cop-op/team work aspect of it, as well as its overall theme/story (the CDC vs. infectious disease outbreaks). I love the rules of this game, how it plays out, and that it can be played in less than an hour. Also, the board, cards, disease cubes, and box are gorgeous! This game looks great on the table and on a shelf. Pandemic is quite easily one of my favorite games of all time!

  My husband and I bought this game to play together. My favorite part about it is that you work WITH the people you are playing with, not against them.It's pretty quick to get the hang of! We had it pretty much down after one game. Although it's not difficult to learn, it IS difficult to win. Honestly, we still haven't won. But, for us, that makes us want to play more and get better at it!If you want an easily winnable game, this might not be for you. However, if you want a fun and exciting challenge that allows you to plan and strategize with your friends, I definitely recommend this game!

Challenging, fun, cooperative game!
","

  This is a great game due to the fact that it is cooperative! Everyone is on the same team and trying to reach the same goal. There is a lot going on and it seems pretty complicated at first, but after a couple games your really get the hang of it. It is very easy to pick up if playing with someone who already knows how since there's quite a bit of instructions and asking them questions is much easier than finding the answer in the multi-page manual. Every time you play is different due to how the cards fall and the individual role cards involved. There are 3 difficulty settings and to be warned, it can be quite challenging to win (especially on the hardest setting). By that just makes winning so much sweeter! I highly recommend this game as it's a great one for fun, planning, teamwork, and communication.

A little bit of work to get started- but super fun!

  I am NOT into board games, especially super complicated ones, so when my husband's friend pulled this one out during the holidays --I was dreading it. BUT to my surprise, it was really really fun! It DOES take a little bit of time to read all the instructions and learn how to play- but once you do, its totally worth it! I LOVE that the game is designed for everyone to play as a team against the pandemic; if you win-you all win, if you lose-you all lose. It was so much fun--We had to buy one for ourselves!

So great!

  My boyfriend and I enjoy playing games together, so we were looking to expand beyond card games and dominoes. This game is very fun and we get to practice working together to solve problems. We've played probably about 10 times now and have realized after each game that we accidentally cheated somehow. It is very important to read the rules thoroughly and take them at their face value. Don't read into them too much or you'll just confuse the intentions of the game. I've googled many rules when we were confused and found many online arguments over the rules that just led me back to taking the rules literally and just accepting that it means it literally. I think this last time we played we finally didn't accidentally cheat. We'll be upping the difficulty for next time! I love that it has different difficulty levels, too, because it allows you to continue to enjoy playing it after you've mastered the premise. Having new characters and combinations of characters also keeps things interesting!

My cousin loved it!
","

  I bought this for my 14 yo cousin for his birthday and he absolutely loved it! He kept playing it over and over again (so much that I found it very repetitive). The game is a little difficult to grasp in the beginning, but the more you play, the better you understand how it's played. It's one of those games you have to play to get the rules (at least in our case). It's a really nice strategy game to play with family and friends; definitely a team-building exercise because you have to work together to win. However, it can easily grow tiring because once you get the hang of the game, it just gets easier and easier to win. I'd suggest playing with a new group of people to keep it fun each time.

For high level students or those motivated to play a difficult game
","

  Bought this game for my high school students based on the recommendation of some middle school students at a different school. My students had a very difficult time comprehending the instructions, and getting interested in it.  The high level students were willing to make an effort, but pairing them with less motivated students ruined the experience.  When they saw other students enjoying a different game; they quickly wanted to abandon Pandemic.But that doesn‚Äôt speak so much to the game and game play as it does for audiences.  I just don‚Äôt trust using this game for a wide range of students and will use it only as an extended activity for gifted or students who have completed all their work and want something else to do. I‚Äôll have to hype it as a reward...but they might see through that ploy pretty quickly.On another note, one of the two boxes I ordered came without the set of white pieces used as medical facilities.  I had to chop up an eraser to stand in for those pieces. I meant to return that copy; but missed the window.  I‚Äôll seek help from the company. Fingers crossed.

  We took this in our camper for a week long vacation off the grid.  The first game took us two hours of reading and stumbling through looking everything up in the directions.  The second game took about 45 minutes.  After a steep learning curve, we now have the hang of it and only occasionally have to stop and refer to the directions. Perfect for a mom, dad and teenager to play together.  It says that you can play with two people, but that seems like it would be tough. We love that this game is cooperative and all  players collaborate and win or lose together.  Lots of opportunities for talking and reasoning.

  I have to quote Wil Wheaton to describe this game because I simply can not find a better way to say it. ""I have had more fun loosing this game than I have had winning a lot of others.""This game is very difficult, but extremely fun and engaging. Despite loosing more often than you win (even on the easiest setting) you and your friends will be fully immersed in this game until the end and enjoy losses just as much as winning. The rules are well thought out and every advantage is well balanced and needs to be coordinated with other members of the team to stand any chance of winning.This is one of the most perfectly developed games I've ever played.

Favorite board game!!
","

  My husband and I LOVE this game. Highly recommend, especially for people who are competitive. This is the first cooperative board game we have ever played and we love it-- we win together or lose together. We work together to come up with the best move for each person and brainstorm/debate which move is best. We are super nerdy and started playing at the highest difficulty after playing ~2 games at a normal difficulty. So far, we win about 50% of the time, but we always seem to get close to winning so it's always fun!Playing this game always leaves people in a good mood, even if we lose. With other board games, you have to choose whether you want to win at all costs and upset friends/family being ruthless, or be nice/casual and pretend like you don't care about winning (but you do...) LOL. Pandemic is just fun and everyone can put in the amount of effort that they want.

very relevant
","

  This game is fun to play and very difficult to win, especially with only three players, because each play has special abilities that help everyone defeat the diseases. All the players must really coordinate their efforts and strategize the best way to stop disease spread. With only 3 players (two of whom are children) we need to modify play a bit to have a chance at winning. The main thing we do is only put two outbreak cards in the deck, and we don't end the game if the whole pile is gone.In short, thanks to Pandemic, I now have a faint glimmer of understanding at how difficult it is to combat and contain highly infectious disease outbreaks around the world. Perhaps, in future editions, one of the specialists could be ""mask distributer"", whose special ability is to go into different cities and reduce their disease outbreaks by one cube just by being there.

Steep learning curve but great game.  Watch the online tutorial videos!
","

  KEY TIP:  Watch the tutorials on YouTube.  The manufacturer has one (ZManGamesOfficial) and there's another one by a guy who does nothing but review games (Watch It Played).  I watched a couple of others and these were the best, by far.  The directions are good as an in-game reference, but not to teach you how to play.  The goal is really this - have one player get 5 card of the same color so you can then cure a disease.  Everything else plays in to that.  Get 5 of the same color, cure the disease, and you're on your way.  Use the player abilities.  They're really helpful.  Collaborate.  That's the fun of the game and what makes it unique.  I've played it 3-player and 4-player, with my kids (14 & 16) and with adults, and it's a lot of fun and a very unique premise for a board game - both in concept and that it's collaborative.Get the game, watch the videos, play the game with the directions/reference handy, and you'll be on your way in no time!

  We learned this game over Christmas break with the family and my husband surprised me with it for Valentines day! It is super fun, challenging with a group - I like that its a group game where everyone works together and either wins together or (sadly) loses together. I think we needed to tweak rules a bit to win with 4 players (max) because it was extremely difficult otherwise but with 2 people it is challenging yet enjoyable and with experience, you will get the hang of it in no time! It may take a while to remember all the rules and nuances, but there are helpful cards that remind you of various rules, etc. so its easy to visually remember. Very happy with purchase.

Fantastically fun cooperative board game.
","

  This game is an absolute blast.  And it is reasonably easy to learn (now this is not Sorry or Chutes and Ladders, but for someone that plays role-playing games like D&D, Munchkin, Pathfinder, etc., this is fairly easy), and yet definitely takes some time to master strategy which leads to good replay value.  It is a great game for a 10 year old.  She learned about geography and maybe a bit about disease, certainly good for problem-solving skills.  We love that it is cooperative and we don't have to worry about hurt feelings (we can be a bit competitive with competitive games).  The quality of the board, cards and pieces is high.  There are a lot of small pieces (the disease cubes, about 7 x 7 x 7 mm) so be warned if you have a baby/toddler around (or a cat like ours that likes to jump on the board while we play), that this could be a definite choking/scattering/getting lost hazard.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who thinks an intelligent, cooperative board game would be fun.  And again, probably 10 years old plus and it is for 2-4 players.  It does seem a bit harder with 2 than 4 players to be honest.  Games take about 30-45 minutes and player number does not seem to affect that.  You do lose or fail to save the world sometimes, but difficulty seems very appropriate after playing 5 or 6 times.  You can adjust difficulty by putting in less epidemic cards (per rule book) or even tweakin rules a bit (allowing cards to be exchanged just by being in same city instead of same city and having card of the city) at first while you learn or with younger players.  We tried this game with a 7 and 8 year old and, at least for those two, I do think this game was a bit too advanced.

Didn't think I would enjoy a cooperative game until playing Pandemic!
","

  I love Euro-Style board games and I have been introducing my kids (6 and 8) to them over the past couple of years; however, there is always bickering and even tears as one child eventually gloats when he/she does something to hinder the other. So, after watching Wil Wheaton play Pandemic on an episode of Table Top, I thought this might be a good way to go, despite some trepidation I had about a cooperative game.  When I saw it for a good price at Amazon, I figured I had nothing to lose, and gave it a shot.Some key benefits about this game (especially when playing with kids) are as follows: The game is really easy to learn, it's really fast to set up, and plays in less than an hour. The game mechanics are very interesting, too (for example, when the dreaded Epidemic card is drawn).  Plus, since it is cooperative, I don't have to ""dummy down"" my strategy when playing with my kids.  Instead, we are all working together to devise the best strategy to use our limited resources on each turn. This is also a huge benefit when introducing someone new to Euro-Style games.  Another benefit (if you want to call it that), is that this game is terribly difficult to win. The board beats us much more often than we win, but since we are all losing together, we oddly have lots of fun doing so.My opinion of cooperative games has definitely changed. I'm not sure if any other ones would bring the same excitement as Pandemic, but I think a have many more hours of Pandemic to play through before I'm bored with this game. Also, even though I mentioned this game with regard to my kids, I play it often with other adults, and it's always fun.

Fun, cooperative, strategy game
","

  This is one of my absolute favorite board games. It allows multiple people to work together and strategize in order to save to world! How much more fun can it get? As a biologist, I also particularly enjoy that you have to try to develop cures for diseases before they go global. Probably one of the best aspects of this game, however, is that it is a COOPERATIVE game. So you aren't good at strategic games and/or don't like being put on the spot? No worries, it is a team effort so others can assist you in coming up with plans. Maybe you or some of your friends are super competitive and losing causes frustration beyond belief? No problem. Your friends cannot really get mad or upset because everyone will win or lose as a team. It is the perfect game and is slightly different every time you play it. Have fun!

  Jaws of the Lion is a fantastic evolution of Gloomhaven's setup. Gloomhaven is a great game and deserves its ranking, but its hard to teach (and play) and the setup takes a while to get going.  Jaws of the Lion shortcuts a lot of the setup and the starter senarios, the added text on cards, and the tips catapult this game up my personal play rankings.  If you were on the fence about spending the money on Gloomhaven this is the game to play first.  The rules and game play mechanics are unchanged and the game is far more ""coached"". This makes it easy to get the core gameplay down and that carries over very well to the original.

***Product Box/Packaging Review for GH:JotL***
","

  I hate reviews that are not about the overall experience of the product so I am sorry that I'm providing one now. However, I feel this is more beneficial (or in line with a product review) than those about the package being lost, damaged, or out of return policy since that doesn't properly represent the product.ACTUAL PRODUCT PACKAGING REVIEW:I just received the game (about 30 minutes ago) and, although I'll probably love the game, I'm a little disappointed with the packaging. At initial glance, I thought the box was damaged because it was bulging (i.e. one side about a 1/2 inch higher than the other when sealed). Upon opening the box, I saw that it was due to the box being poorly designed. It barely holds the game after all the items are punched out and stored ""properly"" in the box. I quoted ""properly"" because I still can't figure out how to get everything to fit inside without the box bulging a little. As it stands and if using the original insert, it's an extremely tight squeeze to the point I keep checking to make sure nothing is being bent. I wish the product/box designer would have given .25 to .50 inch more room for to allow a few more imperfect ways to repackage the game. That said (and even though I hate doing this), I may just remove the insert(s) to allow more ways to configure the game for repackaging purposes.

  The shelf price is around $50 which is what I found this for.  Contains everything you need for Gloomhaven fun in a relatively small(er) box.  The four new characters are interesting though we have only played through our first session.  A must buy if you loved the original Gloomhaven.

  If you already finished Gloomhaven, Jaws of the Lion might not be enough for you to play since it‚Äôs too short and too easier. Frosthaven is possible to be the right one. However, Gloomhaven is too heavy for me and both less than 10 years old kids, we never want to read the whole thing to start playing, so it sits there from 2018 to now. Jaws of the Lion provides a quick method for us to learning how to play Gloomhaven from fist 5 scenario, so we could catch up Gloomhaven easier later. The best thing is for the setting via book style map, so we don‚Äôt need to waste time for setting up. In addition, the storage is improved comparing with Gloomhaven to provide a the token tray. Overall, it does the job right as pre-Gloomhaven learning game.

  The quality you expect from Cephalofair is all there.  This is a great way to get your foot in the door for Gloomhaven and Frosthaven.  The way it moves through the first few scenarios explaining how to play as you go is great.  It's a little easy but that works out well if you plan to move on to Gloomhaven.  Which is a little more complicated.  And the fact that you can use this stuff with Gloomhaven is a huge bonus.

  Our copy was missing a cardboard sheet, and instead had a duplicate of another board. It's an understandable packaging error for an early print of the game, but I've been unable to contact Cephalofair Games to see whether we could obtain a replacement despite multiple emails (radio silence). The game seems like an excellent condensed version of Gloomhaven proper--perhaps it's best to hold off on purchasing until these small issues are addressed.UPDATE: Cephalofair contacted me to help me with our missing piece. I have updated the rating to reflect.

Roleplaying lite in tabletop format with an ever-expanding depth
","

  Cepholofair games has produced a great standalone game that serves as an entry point to their more complex products.  The box is heavy and stuffed with content, and will keep gamers occupied for days.  Solo mode is no more complicated than having a single player control more than one character, and the experience is still enormous fun.The name ""Jaws of the Lion"" belongs to a group of mercenaries (the characters the players will control) in the settlement of Gloomhaven.  The game is structured on a continuing campaign played in individual scenarios with the feel of one of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books.  Actions and decisions made by the players result in the opening of new quest lines and occasionally the closing of others.  After all, if you have the option of helping a shop owner or stealing from her and your first impulse is to steal, your future options will not include helping her as she no longer trusts you.  It should be stressed that this game is cooperative, and each player has a vested interest in teaming up with and enhancing the abilities of the characters of other players as well as their own.  One Leroy Jenkins can have a disastrous effect for the whole group.The mechanics of the game are introduced slowly using a few different booklets, allowing players to get basics cemented before introducing new concepts.  As the story advances and characters increase in power, new abilities are unlocked and new game features made available.  The scenarios are designed to highlight these new abilities and functions, letting players get more comfortable with the foundation of the game and understanding how the characters are intended to perform, making for more creative thinking and dynamic play.Dice are not a part of this game, instead assuming that an attack will have an effect but modified by numeric values or combat effects (eg: stunning, poison) that are determined by modifier decks associated with each character; monsters have their own deck.  Players eventually gain access to items that will increase their abilities and ways to increase their characters' lethality and effectiveness.  Many monsters have innate abilities that produce negative effects on characters, and there is a variance in how tough those opponents become based on the number of players and the power of the characters.  Each scenario is challenging, and may require more than a single effort to pass.Monsters are actually controlled by the players based on rules about the order in which they become active, what player character is targeted by attacks, and how the monsters will move.  This information is usable by the players and can become key strategic factors when moving, attacking, etc.  A weaker character may try to move later in the round than a monster that deals a great bit of damage so that a more robust character can soak up the attacks.  The character moves after those monsters attacks so she is safe, then attacks at the end of the round; on the next round, the character moves as early as possible to get out of the way before the powerful monster gets a chance to attack her back.The scenario booklet is well structured and contains the maps on which the game is played.  The rules being in a separate booklet means that the scenario describes details specific to the current adventure of the characters but there is no need to disturb the figures and terrain features to look up effects or resolve rules-based questions.  A well-designed breakup of function that makes learning the game and playing through the scenarios easier than a disruptive method that bundles everything into a single booklet.It is rare that I have encountered simplified versions of games that are effective at easing a person into a more complicated ruleset; the best example I can think of is the early '80s when Dungeons & Dragons was a streamlined entry point from which players would then graduate to the more detailed Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.  Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion has successfully become the most effective game I have seen for whetting the apetites of people who want to learn Gloomhaven but have been intimidated by the size and complexity of that system.The items and basic mechanisms of this game are reprints of components from the more complicated Gloomhaven game, and the characters - once developed to use standard cards roughly around level 5 - seem portable and compatible with the big brother game.  I am also tempted to go back and try a modified version of Jaws of the Lion using classes from the standard Gloomhaven game starting from level 1.If you or your group are into fantasy / roleplaying games but the cost of multiple rule books is daunting, or adventures are too easy or hard because encounters are not well scaled to your level, or play has become too formulaic, this is an easily affordable game with high replay value and excellent foundational systems for combat and character development.Buy this game, and add Gloomhaven to your wishlist.

  Where do I start?First off, the box and parts; I received the product with a missing XP dial. I emailed Suppot@cephalofairgames.com and explained what was missing. They responded immediately that some of the games also had been shipped (as they were 1st wave) with a misprinted Monster standee. He indicated that he was going to go ahead and ship those with the missing part I requested. As I had not been that deep into the game at that point, I hadn't noticed if I had misprinted pieces. I pulled them out to check and what do you know? He was right. I received the missing dial and new standees the next day in the mail. Talk about TOP NOTCH service! The miniatures are detailed and durable. All of the components are upper tier without a doubt! They went away from the dungeon tile route and now utilize a spiral notebook with pre drawn, hex mapping right in the book. quality is 10/10.The game; WOW! Talk about an immersive, narrative driven dungeon crawl experience. This is next level game play. The spiral book maps accomplish 2 things very well. 1: Set up time is diminished considerably as you do not have to search for the correct tile to lay for any given scenario, it already there. 2: Even better, the art! Oh, the ART! Because they went this way the art work is SPECIFIC for that exact scenario. If you are in a forest, there are fallen trees, in a cave, stalagmites, boulders etc. The generic tiles were...well, generic. They needed to be able to accommodate the 100 plus scenarios of the original GH so the art was same same pretty much throughout.Also, the way they implemented the training wheels on the front five scenarios is hopefully going to become and industry standard in gaming. Those of you even remotely interested in the hobby know that some of the games coming out these days can be extremely heavy and complex. To the point where it can be intimidating to get it to your table, let alone purchase. The way they did this really is one of the most innovative things I have seen in the industry, maybe ever. I have more creators pick this up and run with it. I believe that barrier of entry on many games that people are intimidated by can be broken by utilizing this method.The story is great, The gameplay, strategy, puzzle pieces of the game are EPIC. If you are even half way interested in the theme, D&D, Pathfinder, or any other fantasy driven RPG, this is a MUST buy. I enjoy this game with others, but for me, the solo experience is great. If you were ever wondering if it is possible to play an RPG solo, here it is. Buy it, play it. You won't regret it.

  This game is awesome, one of my favorite games ever. I'm a big fan in general of cooperative games and dungeon-delving (I'm also very into d&d), and Gloomhaven held my interest for *years* of regular play. I'm not far into Jaws yet, but it feels basically the same, but with less work - clearly there's not as much content as in Gloomhaven, but it's seriously just as good a game.But unless you're very into tactical tabletop you should probably watch a video on how to play game before you get started, there's still a lot of rules to pick up.

Great way to introduce family to Gloomhaven
","

  I was steadily playing Gloomhaven with a group for over a year at a friend's house, and I decided to pick up my own with an Amazon Honey watch at $80.  My purpose was to buy when still in print to play someday down the road with my family.  When the price hit my target I bought the game.Well, my 10 and 7 yr old sons saw the game and wanted to play.  We busted out all of the pieces and got everything organized into plano cases.  We did two games, which they were able to catch on to with the wife playing also, without much trouble.  The kids play Magic and are good at gaming.Fast forward five months later and we haven't played again.  The kids ask, but I have been reluctant to spend an hour to setup and another 30 mintues to go over the game again.  Then I saw on this version of Gloomhaven was out with a slim game and easier setup, but same play.  This was a perfect concept so I bought Jaws of the Lion from my local gameshop (couldn't wait for shipping).  We have played up to scenario 4 over one week.  We did get our but kicked on 4 and need to play again, but that happens.I really love the way they slowly guide you through the rules with Jaws of the Lion.  I'm a terrible teacher and the way this game is setup, it takes the teacher role out of my hands.  The guide walks you through the rules slowly kind of like a video game slowly introduces new abilities.  I also love how the setup is at least cut in half from the regular version.  With all that, that game play is exactly the same as normal Gloomhaven that we all love and has been the #1 game on Boardgamegeek for over 2 yrs.

Now my wife's favorite game
","

  We are a gaming family with about 80 board games, so keep that in mind but in the past, my wife would ridicule Dungeons and Dragons.  When I brought up Gloomhaven (the original), her response would be, ""knock yourself out!"" with no interest in playing.  I think that it was largely intimidation - I mean the original Gloomhaven is HUGE!With Jaws of the Lion, I told her that it was designed to introduce the game to people who have never played D&D.  She looked at the first scenario and agreed to try it with me.  Happy to say, 12 plays later, she LOVES it!  She told me that it's her new favorite game.  Then, she convinced both of my daughters (22 and 12) to play with us too!  The way that it 'holds your hand' during the first few games has been all the difference, I believe.  Now we're discussing getting the Original Gloomhaven once we complete this game.I love this game too, it's been a ton of fun.  If I were to rate it based only on game play, it would easily be a 5 of 5.  But the game was missing cards (which were replaced, thank you) and from what I read, that is much too common, maybe as much as 25% of the boxes.If you do get this game, be sure to look at all of the components right away to make sure that you have everything.

Mission-based Cooperative Dungeon Explorer

  Board gaming has been my main hobby for the last 8 years, and here is why this has become my favorite game in a landslide.  I purchased this at a friendly local game store but felt compelled to write a review on Amazon.Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion has you teaming up with 1-3 other friends to form a party who go on various missions.  Each player has a deck of card. Each player picks two cards each turn to act out their special abilities from attacking, moving, healing, etc.  That is the core of the game.  What makes this game wonderful is all the other components around this main mechanic and the devotion put into its fairness/balance and other gameplay features.The game is played on a spiral bound book containing maps.  The first 5 scenarios slowly introduce rules one chunk at a time.  The phrase ""How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time"" really applies here.  By the end of your fifth game, you have learned the rules of the game including how to move enemies, inflict poison, detonate traps, level up your character, and other items that add depth and strategy to the game.  By the way, leveling up is sooooooo satisfying when you get to update your attack modifier deck and add a new powerful card to your deck.The original Gloomhaven was too intimidating for me with too many rules and too long of a game. This game has made me comfortable with the rules, and I already look forward to buying full size Gloomhaven upon completing this lite version.  My gaming partner and I text all week about when we can get back together and play through a few more missions.We have twice finished a mission on the last card and performed a yelling, double high-five!  My wife upstairs wonders what in the heck we are doing in a board game to make us do that!  I can't recommend this game enough.

  So yeah, I had no interest in picking up gloomhaven, I love dungeon crawlers (HeroQuest, Warhammer quest, decent etc) and rpg games (D&D 2,5e, WFRP 1-4e, Pathfinder 1e). I didn't see a reason to own another giant game system. So I randomly came across this at in a Target store of all places and thought it looked interesting. I haven't been disappointed, it's a fantastic game. It's actually the most intuitive and fun ""learn to play"" I've made it through. The contents are top notch, a great and fun rouge's gallery, a couple VERY different characters to play as, and a attempt at a organizer... It could have been better but not something that I could see as a down fall. For $50 or less, if your a fan of any of the aforementioned genre or titles, i'de say you'll fully enjoy this title.

  A great start for new gamers to experience Gloomhaven, but for a long-term player of Gloomhaven, I was slightly unsatisfied by the simplicity. Additionally, if you own the unofficial extended battle goals by Satire, you will find that all of the battle goals included in Jaws of the Lion are repeats of the original and unofficial expansion, shy of two (arguably one). Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this to new players and those willing to pay for the extra content and lore. However, expect simplicity and for a lot of things not to be touched on, if you are used to the original.

  I bought Candyland as my youngest granddaughter is now of the age to play. However, when I looked at the board, I was extremely disappointed!! The snowflake princess looks like a beauty pagant contestant, and then there is the licorice creepy, leering Spaniard (really?) holding a snake!? This board is sending very negative messages to our little ones! Please beware!!!

Fun Way To Teach Colors
","

  I remember Milton-Bradley as the original maker of Candy Land, which it eventually sold to Hasbro. Candy Land is a great way to initiate family game night! It‚Äôs fun to play this childhood game with my grandson to help reinforce his color knowledge, too.If you have a high-energy kid, the thin cards will get creased and bent straight away, which is to be expected with any game that uses cards rather than a spinner. No worries. It means your game is getting plenty of use, which is the entire point, right?If price is more important to you than time, shop around locally.  I overpaid on Amazon and found out later I could get this exact version for $7.99 elsewhere.My other issue is the board design I received which is too busy (see my photo). It makes it difficult for beginners to distinguish the path from the other game board illustrations. If this bothers you, too, try looking for the Retro Series Candy Land edition.Yes, I‚Äôd buy Candy Land again, but I‚Äôd do a bit more checking on prices and different editions first.

No longer suitable for younger children
","

  The new layout of this game is terrible for young children. The spaces are too small for the game pieces (which is challenging for little hands with developing fine motor skills) and the graphics are way too busy (which makes it hard for a child to easily follow the path). The recommended age range is 3-6, which I think was accurate for the original design, but it is certainly not true now. I was very disappointed when I saw the game board and we no longer try to play it because it is too frustrating for my daughter.

Not your mother's Candy Land

  I purchased  this for my granddaughter thinking it was the classic version of the game.  It's not.  The female characters have had lip fillers and boob jobs.  I remember playing this with my children as an early introduction to games that instilled fair play and how to win and lose graciously.  This version has no ""winner.""  It's all about the ""adventure""  which is fine, but then what is the point of a board game?

My granddaughter loves it
","

  I spend spend quite a bit of time with my three-year-old granddaughter and decided it was time to try out a simple board game. My own daughters had loved Candy Land, but I no longer had that version, so I decided to purchase a new one. When I read some of the negative reviews of this version, I was a little hesitant and checked out the reviews for the classic version. It sounded like the older version was poorly made - thin cards, playing pieces that broke easily, so I decided to go with Sweet Adventures. Yes, the board is a little busy, but the path is clearly seen. The spaces on the path do seem smaller than I remember, but the pieces fit on there and my granddaughter had no trouble placing her piece on the appropriate space. A few of reviewers complained about some of the female characters being too sexy and the ""leering Spaniard"". When I opened the game I took a good look at the board and went back to those reviews with a ""what are you talking about"" frame of mind. The Ice Castle princess is no more provocative than Elsa, Jasmine, Belle in her ball gown, Pocahontas, or any other more recent female Disney character. The ""leering Spaniard"" is a pirate; he is supposed to be a villain. There was also a comment about there being no point to the game because there is no winner, but I assume the winner, if that is important to you, is the first player to reach the Castle. The bottom line for me was that my granddaughter and I had fun playing the game together while she is learning basic skills, including following directions and taking turns. She already knows colors, but this, too, is a skill that can be developed if a child doesn't know them yet. There is no reading involved and counting only to two, so it is a perfect game for her age group.

  When looking to buy Candyland for my son I was sad to hear that the newer versions of the game have a spinner rather than cards and that the characters have changed and are overly sexualized. I ended up with this versions and am happy with it. It has cards and while some of the characters are different from what I remember, they are not dressed in lingerie with lollipops over their breasts. My 4 year old lives this game and it's a great introduction into board games. Taking turns, matching colors, following rules, and sometimes losing are all great skills he is acquiring by playing this game.

  I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter and we had a blast. I enjoyed the optional game play they offer that each turn you pick 2 cards and choose which one you want to use. It not only helped the game go faster if we were in a bit of a rush, but it helped my daughter with developing logic and strategy skills. We played the regular way as well and it is always exciting when someone gets a character card and gets sent across the map. I highly recommend this game.The size was perfect and the colors bright and attractive.

  So, this was purchased as a gift for my 4 year old for Christmas. She enjoyed playing it and was very happy with the purchase. It came in pristine condition as was to be expected from a ‚Äúnew‚Äù purchase. I only took a star off because Hasbro seems to have altered the game board from what it was 20 something years ago when my sisters and I played with it. Same idea, same game play, just lacks nostalgia (which has no impact on the kids, just us parents). Also, I don‚Äôt remember having so many double pieces as it has now, so the game goes by pretty fast.

Candyland almost like how I played it when I was a child
","

  This is a classic game and my kids love it, too. Their attention span varies but gameplay is relatively quick in this game. I don't let them cheat and not go backwards, when they choose on of the character cards that they've already passed. I feel that it teaches them good gamesmanship and how they can't always get what they want (and how to deal with disappointment). We've ha some meltdowns and refusals to continue to play ... but these are life lessons that Candyland is teaching - so thankful for the opportunity to remember and share my childhood with my kids ... and also teach them how to be human beings. The game pieces are of the same quality, the board is the old-school type that folds in half and is solid. The cards are the same bendable (and too easily creased) quality that I remember in my childhood. The actual board/gamepath and the character cards have been redesigned. I prefer the old one where the cards were the actual people, rather than just symbols (e.g. a picture of the blue princess vs. a snowflake). I'm almost 40 and I still remember picking up that princess card and feeling like I won the lottery.

  First of all, the game pieces are too big for the board. One piece fills more that one square! And there is no way to put more than one piece on a square. The board is also incredibly overstimulating for kids because it is SO COLORFUL and every inch of the board is jam packed with as much stuff as they can fit on it. My young kids (correct age for the game) can't focus on the path. This was my favorite game growing up, and I'm going to have to buy the retro version that being sold or search thrift stores for an earlier version.

  Board games are more and moreNot what they used to be. A now parent who is cycling through these games a second time around from when I was a kid playing them myself, the pieces and boards have gotten so thin and cheap. The playing board is so small and the images and path are jam packed on the board completely taking away from the play space, story line and adventure! The board is so busy it is hard for small children to follow the path as it gets lost in all the pictures around it. Nor are they able to take in what is going in each section of the board as they travel through candy land to get to candy castle. All the colors are bold and bright making your eyes unable to focus as an adult let alone a three year old. This is a perfect example of less is more. There are so many cute details that just simply overlooked because are crammed on a small board. The game pieces hardly fit on each color square. I am very disappointed. Apparently, the board has been was redesigned many times and most recently in 2002 or somewhere around there. The 2002 version gives much more breathing room allowing kids of all ages to better take in what is happening in the game/story.

  My two-year-old granddaughter loves this game. She  follows some rules and makes up others. For example, she has learned and loves taking turns. She loves choosing a card. She has learned and loves saying the card color and counting ""One"" or ""One, twoooooo"". She is learning to follow the path. She rejoices in everyone's turn.But she has also decided she only wants the candy/sweet cards and looks through the pile to find them. She doesn't care about reaching the castle. She usually doesn't follow the path correctly.The life skills and game skills she is learning and the fun she has all make the rule-changing worthwhile. So, fellow boardgame purist, don't insist that your little ones learn and follow all the rules. That will come in time.  Sharing, turn-taking, enjoying the success of others---these are the skills that are truly worth practicing by playing this game.

  This game is so fun, no matter what age you are! This comes with instructions just in case you need to remind yourself of the rules or how to play, but it is very straight forward! I personally like to use one of the tops of the boxes and spread out the cards. Once you pick a card, we put it back in the box. This way, everyone could get the best (or the worst) of the cards and it makes it way more fun than just one person getting the ""special"" candy/dessert cards.

  Candy Land is the perfect classic game for the whole family.  This game is basic enough for small children and as an adult it is still fun and exciting.  It has brought back so many fun memories for me.  I am so happy that I can share this fun game with my children.  No skill is required and because it's all about matching colors it's a very simple game.  There is a reason it has been around for so long.

  I rate toys using a 3 category system. I look at their entertainment value, durability, and creativity. Every toy needs to keep a child's attention, be able to stand up to their rough playing, and either promote their creativity or be used to play in creative ways. I'll start with a short review and then explain my reasons for the rating in detail.We bought this for my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas, and it has been a big hit.  Her and her 2-year-old brother beg to play it everyday when I get home from work.  It is fun and colorful, and helps to teach them how to be patient and take turns as well as how to have fun, even if you don't finish first.ENTERTAINMENT:Candy land is simple enough for a 2-year old to figure out, and fun enough not to make the parents who have to play with them completely miserable.  It brings back memories from my childhood, so I have a lot of fun playing as well.My daughter loves counting the colors, and she loves narrating her path and telling stories about how she met Queen Frostine on her way to King Candy's castle.  My son loves drawing the cards and moving his piece along the path.DURABILTY:The board is very sturdy, but the cards get pretty messed up pretty quick.  My son has already crumpled up the cupcake card, so we know when that one is coming in the stack. There is a version of this game that has a spinner instead of cards, which they got from my brother for Christmas (what a coincidence), but my kids enjoy picking a card more than using the spinner.CREATIVITY:My daughter gets pretty creative telling stories about the Candy Land characters, but the best part about this game is that it teaches kids how to be patient and wait for their turn in a creative way.My kids are pretty patient for being toddlers, but they are still toddlers.  When they want something, they want it, and they usually aren't willing to wait for their turn.  But within a few minutes of playing, they were remarkably good at taking turns.  They cheered each other on, even if the other one just passed them up.  They loved every minute of it.Outside of game play, I have noticed them taking turns with toys and not fighting as much.  They still fight, just not as much. They share their toys a lot better.  I didn't expect that to happen. I don't think people really think that a board game would be able to teach kids life lessons, but its surprising how they carry the little things into their everyday interactions.In conclusion, this is a great way to introduce children to board games and teach them patience and good sportsmanship.  Its a must have for young children.

  I couldn't wait to buy this for my 3-year-old granddaughter since it was so well loved by my children and also my cousins and me way back when.  It's very simple and straightforward, and I even enjoy playing it myself.  The 3-year-old loves getting out the game and discussing the pictures and screaming with joy when she gets a special treat card - even if it sends her back to start!  She doesn't quite get the concept of the game yet and is a little bored with just moving her piece, but she likes the idea of being able to play one-on-one with an adult and without her younger sister - who really at 18 months just cannot be trusted not to mess it all up. We're working on the concepts of taking turns and following directions, and this is a good teacher.  You only need to know your colors and how to count to 2!  The only negative is the board design, although my granddaughter is fascinated with it.  It seems too bright and busy and kind of distracting for a child who often just wants to discuss the scenes.  It's still bound to be a favorite, as expected, and we play at least once a day.

  This is such a great first game for smaller children! It allows young ones to practice game skills like good sportsmanship and taking turns, while encouraging counting.Also, since almost nothing in the game requires reading (assuming at least one person knows or can read the rules), this is inclusive of younger not-yet-readers as well as for groups in which there is more than one primary written/reading language.Success in the game depends on chance not strategy.

  I ordered this for my young children, reflecting nostalgically on my own childhood during which I would sit in front of this game board and play with the pieces for what seemed like hours. I was hoping for the same experience for them. Unfortunately they've remade the game where it now reflects that chaotic scenes in children's television programming. The game board is smaller, super crowded, and way too busy. It was difficult to even follow the colored road! I felt overstimulated just glancing at the board. It was really disappointing.

Nicely made like the good old days
","

  received this today and so happy with the quality. I bought this for our 6 yr old granddaughter and she will love it. I particularly loved the game board. It is like the original one in that it is a good solid board which folds in half for storage. I bought, in the store, at Christmas the chutes and ladders game for her and it is very cheaply made with a flimsy board and just not the same quality as this. Thanks!

Classic Game

  Candy Land is the perfect game to play with young children.  My grandson loves it at 5 years old and it has been a favorite for a couple of years.  The cards are just heavy paper and might have been better if more substantial. But all in all, classic game.

NOT like the original game

  Game came intact.  Very busy and colorful.  It was my fault that I did not read that this was a different version from the original game.  I gifted this to my 3-yr old nephew, hoping to follow our family's Candy Land tradition.  It was not well received.  This new game is too busy, hard to follow.  The original game was simpler, easier for small ones to understand.

  Took this on vacation for the boys, First time playing a board game. It took a little while for the 5 year old that it's not fair to dig down in the deck to find the needed car ): but over time he's really starting to get the life lesson that it's not fair to cheat (what if his friend did that to him?} and that it's not always about winning, but having fun

  There's a reason this game has been around for decades. Easy to learn and easy to play. My 4-year-old and I have played this game a thousand times. It's a family game night win when you're playing with little ones who can't yet read! This version is also quite sturdy and will hold up to some toddler/preschooler abuse.

  So much fun for at-home date night!! We put the kids to bed early, ordered in, poured some wine, and solved a mystery!!  This set is VERY well priced. We were amazed at the value of what we got and how much fun we had together. We went through every document and piece of evidence, took notes, made a timeline, deciphered the code, and correctly solved the murder! Definitely buying the Hunt A Killer subscription service; this is the perfect monthly date night.

  This is a one time purchase, not a subscription.  The pictures provided by the seller pretty much shows you the whole deal.  The padlocked bag is not leather of any kind, but fabric.  You are given the solution in a sealed envelope, but I encourage you to look for help online if you get stuck.  There are a lot of folks who will be happy to help, without spoiling the whole game for you, you just need to ask.

Enjoyed the game but the ending was anticlimactic
","

  My husband and I solved this game and it was very fun, we may pass it to family and friends (since you can only use the game one time).  Took us a long time, especially the decoding, just that alone took us 1 hr and total it was about 3 hours.  We are extremely thorough though and would try to pick apart every single piece of evidence.  We had a sense of who it was earlier in the game before the coding though but wanted every last piece of evidence to fully PROVE who the killer was.  I think unfortunately it left us mildly unsatisfied at the end when we didn‚Äôt really get a full explanation, I was almost hoping for a play by play of what exactly happened that night during the murder but instead it was more so ‚Äúthis is who it is, they‚Äôre in jail‚Äù type situation.  I loved the details and how ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù every piece of evidence felt.  There was even some humor in the clues which was a good break up of some laughs in some ‚Äúserious‚Äù discovery.  All the details definitely made us think there would be a more detailed description at the end so we have no questions or ‚Äúhow did it fully happen‚Äù type scenarios in our heads.  Overall we would definitely get more though because the process was super fun, hoping the ending to future games is as detailed as the rest of the game.

I highly recommend this high quality immersive Murder Mystery Experience!
","

  This is a WONDERFUL representation of the WORLD'S #1 Murder Mystery Company - Hunt A Killer!  I have investigated and solved mysteries of all varieties from Hunt A Killer, usually at a cost upward of $150, as a deluxe box set, a premium mystery, and as the classic subscription Mystery consisting of 6 episodes each.  I was very excited when I learned that this was being made available to a wider audience for a MUCH LOWER COST. At $30.00 - this is an amazing value and opportunity!  The high quality that is the Hunt a Killer reputation is 100% applicable to THIS Mystery despite the low cost.  I hope that people will utilize this Mystery to learn how wonderful the Hunt A Killer experience can be, perhaps as a ""test"" before committing to a long term subscription.  For those of us already aware of, and members of, the Hunt A Killer subscription family - utilize this opportunity to grab a fun quality mystery for your own enjoyment or as a gift. I don't know how, if you want to take your time and enjoy the experience, it could be solved in 45-60 minutes.  It took me hours to organize, investigate, and solve the mystery.  However, I was in no hurry and was taking my time, working alone, for pure enjoyment.

Wrong Combination!?!

  The crucial lock combination which opens 3 additional items and the clues needed to solve this mystery was set incorrectly. I had to use the website ‚Äúreveal‚Äù to confirm that the combination was set wrong prior to packaging.

Fun and Engaging - But wrong code!
","

  Purchased this game for date night and we had fun! We have a recurring subscription to the ""Hunt a Killer"" games, but got this one to fill the time ""in between"" our subscription boxes.Deducted stars only because the code on our bag was incorrect (didn't match the clues). We verified this by looking at their hint website afterwards. When we received the game, it was actually already set on what the CORRECT numbers should be though, so the bag automatically popped open without us having to try and guess anything, and we were able to finish the game. If it hadn't already been pre-set to the correct numbers, we wouldn't have been able to complete the game though since there were 3 crucial pieces of evidence in there. So that would have been understandably frustrating. Surprised to see that happen with the level of detail & quality that typically goes into their games, but we still enjoyed it despite that.

  Best date night we've had in forever! I give it a very, very strong recommendation. It's not so much a game as a series of clues you unravel to determine the murderer out of a number of suspects, and it was incredibly fun. You'll love it too if you're into serial killer / true crime stuff.  You read through a detailed list of suspects, pore through crime scene photos, figure out the combination to a locked case containing more clues, decipher codes, etc..This is just a one-off box they sell in stores but HUNT A KILLER is a subscription box that sends you a mystery each month and I think we're going to have to sign up for this. I figured something out towards the end that was such a delicious a-HAH moment that I need to chase that dragon for a while.

  This is our first time doing HAK. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and plan to get a subscription to continue.Pros:1. Great quality. The evidence is not cheesy, cheap, or lame.2. It‚Äôs a pretty good value. It‚Äôs about 2-3 hours to complete, not 45-60 min. It‚Äôs about the same price we‚Äôd spend on going to the movies.Cons:1. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúconfession‚Äù from the killer in the solution envelope that explains what happened that night. It‚Äôs just X did it and they are in jail.2. There was supposedly a clue in a photocopying a photo but it is impossible to see (others have commented on this in reviews as well). Fortunately, we figured out the ultimate takeaway from other evidence.

  ¬†The main clues Which were inside of the locked bag could not be accessed because the lock on the bag was defaulted or set to the wrong code. We verified this by going to the death at the dive bar website and confirmed that about code was correct yet it still would not work no matter what we did. I would not suggest buying this game as you were left without important information to solve the crime

  I've done virtually everything this company has produced, so I was already familiar with their products. This is a particularly nicely done example, though. The quality is very high, the story is good, and the mystery/puzzle aspect is clever and multi-layered. You have to do puzzles, but you also have to think and process. It's very well orchestrated. My only minor complaint is that in one image, it's hard to see the thing you're supposed to see. I'd like to see HAK put out more of these.

  So let‚Äôs start by saying this was so entertaining! My 4 girlfriends and I poured over this while having drinks. We got serious about solving it but still able to laugh, crack jokes, and have a good time. It‚Äôs a fake crime after all... but SO well thought out and you really had to pick it apart to solve but it wasn‚Äôt so tough that it was over our tipsy heads. I was unsure of getting this for a girls weekend.. but it‚Äôs totally perfect for that. You don‚Äôt have to be into crime solving to want to crack this case. It reminded us of an escape room you can do right in your home. One thing I would complain about is that our code bag was broke .. we had discovered the correct code in the first 20 min and it was jammed .. so we thought it was wrong.. didn‚Äôt discover this for over an hour .. but honestly with that broken bag it was still a great time. You won‚Äôt regret getting this.

Disappointed - and wrong bag combo!!

  We bought this for a fun date night in - we love escape rooms and are really good at them, so we were looking forward to this. unfortunately, the code to the bag was set when we opened it (which did NOT match the numbers the clues led to). Thankfully since it was already on the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù numbers, we were still able to get into the bag. We looked through every piece of evidence trying to find the ‚Äúdeeper meaning‚Äù because it seemed too obvious at first glance. Nope - nothing more to see/find. We spend THREE hours trying to figure out what we were missing, so we definitely felt like we wasted a lot of time for nothing. We had wanted to try the subscription, but if the boxes are all like this, we won‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs too bad - we really looked forward to this.

  This game was going great, until we tried multiple times to open the locked bag and were unsuccessful. After multiple attempts we decided to use the clues/hints to determine what the lock was and it was something we had tried MULTIPLE TIMES and the bag STILL WOULD NOT OPEN. To spend the money that I did on this game for the lock to not be set appropriately is ridiculous. Now we have to try and pop the lock open somehow to determine what clues we have missed because we want to finish the game that we paid for.Word to the wise, don‚Äôt buy this game because the lock may not be set correctly and you can‚Äôt finish the game unless you break in to it.

Upgrade from Old Murder Mystery Sets!
","

  Back in the early 2000's, we used to do Murder Mystery Parties with our group of friends. They were kits in boxes where everyone was assigned a character and we followed a loose script to solve the mystery. This is nothing like that. It's an upgraded version for sure. I would describe it as somewhat similar to an escape room experience, but instead of trying to escape, you are solving a murder. There are no characters to assign which is a relief! I hated trying to assign characters without offending people. And the characters were assigned genders so if you didn't have an even number of guys and girls, someone would have to play the opposite. It was never a big deal in my group of friends, but it could be for some.  Here you are the detective and team doing the solving. It comes with all kinds of fun evidence. There's a newspaper clipping that looks like a real newspaper clipping. There's a traffic ticket, photos, and so much more. I was very impressed with the level of creativity that went into it. The old style mystery boxes would have silly clues that didn't look real. This is so much cooler! If you use pencil or write out notes on your paper, you could easily pass this set onto someone else.

  If you enjoy a good mystery and like watching crime shows, you have to give one of these games a try!! It's truly like you're a private investigator and you have to solve the murder of the owner of Old Scratch Tavern.  They give you tons of items in the box to investigate different suspects.  You even have to learn to crack codes to decipher clues to figure out the mystery. The items included are neat, because they look so real...an old newspaper article, restaurant menus, coasters, crime scene photos, etc. It can be played with as few as one person or as many as you want, in a group. It's great because your group can work together to solve the crime,no matter how many people you have working on it.  It's an awesome idea for a date night or a large party to play together! It is only a one time game...once you figure out the killer, you can't play again. However, you can pass it on to someone else you know that hasn't played it yet! Nothing in the box will be ruined for the next people to play.  Considering you can only play it once, it seems a little pricey, however, it's definitely worth the cost for the entertainment! It's such a unique game experience, I can't recommend it enough!

Easy to learn with good strategy elements, 2-4 players!
","

  Within the past year I got into board games and over this year I have acquired a decent collection and have played a variety of games in terms of themes and difficulty. I'm pretty hooked! When Azul won the Spiel des Jahres in 2018 I ""had"" to buy it. I wanted to get in on a hot new game to understand why it's well revered. Since buying it I've played about 12 games, mostly 2 players, but a few 4 player games and it's a blast.The game revolves around picking up tiles and placing them to score points, that is the most simplistic explanation. The game start off slowly without much tension, but as your board fills up the game becomes pretty cutthroat as you try to force your opponent to take tiles that will cause them to lose points while mitigating the point loss on your own board. It requires thinking ahead and critical thinking. It's a fantastic board game that takes 1 round to teach, and many rounds to develop a strategy.There are Youtube videos to learn the game easily, don't be hesitant if you're looking for pretty game that is suitable for the family that will help keep your brain sharp. Azul is well worth the price.My only issue with Azul is that there are some beautiful tile designs on the board game cover that are not available in the game. The plain red and blue tiles would benefit from having some beautiful designs like the cover indicates. Otherwise, I have no caveats with this game. The components are nice to hold and look at, and the game is fun to play.

Very Disappointed in Quality and Customer Service
","

  Having played Azul with friends, we decided to buy it because it was so much fun.We were really disappointed when we received Azul the first time because because the player boards were all ripped along the edges, and all the pieces felt like very cheap plastic, especially compared to when we played the game before with friends.So we returned and exchanged the game. The new game arrived today and again the player boards are ripped around the edges, the box was crushed a little on the side, and very cheap pieces. Some of the symbols were printed off-center on the small square pieces. We are not happy to get the same game twice in a row with cheap pieces and poor quality.I contacted Amazon customer service, and they weren't willing to give us any type of refund on the game, unless I returned again. It's annoying to keep going back and forth to the post office to return items. The pictures speak for themselves. No one wants a new item to be delivered damaged twice in a row.The gameplay is great. I really recommend it, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the 2 games we bought, and how poor customer service has been in working with us.

Poor customer support - 6-month delay on replacing defective parts
","

  This is a revised review. I wrote the below review soon after purchasing the game. It took the company 6 months to replace the defective parts, but better late than never.The game itself seems good. However, the copy I received was defective in a couple ways:1) The game comes with a cloth bag for putting in tiles. The bag came with a rip2) The game comes with 4 ""player boards"". They must produce them in sheets with multiple boards per sheet, and then someone ""tears"" them apart. In this process, two of our boards had their edges torn. It doesn't affect playability, but it does impact aesthetics.I expect a game company to stand by its products and send replacements. I contacted the company online a week ago and have received absolutely no response. I sent them another email and received no response. At minimum, I expect a company to respond to communications.

it looked like fun and I decided to buy
","

  I recently bought this game after having seen an article stating the game had won a ""game of the year"" honor.  After looking into it, it looked like fun and I decided to buy.  Sure enough, the honor is worth it.  My wife and I really enjoy the game.  We tried it out for the first time this weekend, just the two of us.  After playing a few rounds, thinking we would call it a night, we kept deciding to play ""just one more game"".The setup is very simple.  The rules are overall easy, but they can be just a little confusing at first when you're trying to figure out the point of the game.  After watching a couple of ""how to play"" videos on YouTube, we got it and off we went.  When you play, the first few rounds seem pretty simple.  But as you get further in the game, the gameplay really tightens up and you have to think of the best way to move forward.  Do you go for extra points?  Or do you try to block your opponents from getting theirs?  It's both simple in design, and a little complex in strategy.  Love that!The build quality of the game is pretty high. Each player gets their own game board that is nice and solid/stiff.  The ""store"" disks are fairly sturdy and remind you of cardboard coasters (these would be the least sturdy of the whole set).  The tiles are very sturdy and well made.  And the tile bag is nice and thick fabric.  Overall, it's a very attractive and well executed design.I can see us enjoying this game for many years.  I'm looking forward to my next round.

  We're really enjoying this game requiring different thinking/playing than most of our other games.  Aesthetically, we wish the 2 plain kinds of tiles had been given a design like the other 3 kinds, but this is a great game.  We bought a second drawstring bag to put tiles in after play, and that helps with a more smooth flow of the game.  We also enjoy playing ""blind"" sometimes by shielding our boards from view - especially when playing with only two people.

  The rules of Azul are simple and as one starts to play, well, the feeling is that it is a fun game. But as you get more involved with the game, you realize that it is not as simple as it seems. There are tactical nuances that you only discover as you play and as players become more sophisticated in their strategy. There is much to compromise or risk with choices, depending on what other players are doing. It is an engaging game that lasts a short time and the visual design is beautiful. It has become one of our family favorites, great for those cold winter evenings around the fireplace.

  Great Gift for family, friends or yourself. Teaches Strategic Thinking on many levels.The game involves using tile to cover your wall. As with most great games on the surface it is easy enough for kids 10+ to play, the more you play the more you learn there are multiple strategies. After a few rounds, you learn that it is not best to be the first to ""win"" by completing a row to end the game. You actually get more points by having all of the tiles of a color or completing a column.  You need to watch your board and the other players board to devise your completing a row strategy.After two rounds, the  kids were able to hold their own with a few strategic hints.The more you play, the more you learn to play smart rather than fast. Once you tackle the strategies you can take the game to a whole new level by flipping the game board over and play the blank wall  option.  The game boards are thick, substantial cardboard and the tiles are colorful, thick, plastic pieces.  This is not a game you will play a few times and get bored with. I see there is an expansion kit of Joker tiles, which will add a whole new curve ball to the game.  I hope to add that to my collection soon.

  Bought the game Azul that was listed in ""new"" condition. We bought it back in October along with many other games a few (including this) I stored away and periodically we open a new one on our family game night. Last week we finally opened Azul. As we started opening it our son commented on the game boards looking very worn. As we continued to open we see the packages also seem quite disheveled and one of the red tiles is outside the bag of red tiles. All seeming random only after we counted the red tiles it was clearly an extra. Then we come to realize that the starting player tile is completely missing from the package. At this point it is all clear that this game isn't in new condition and likely had been played, repackaged without all the extra parts. We are past the amazon return window so can no longer even return the item. So be sure to check any items from this seller immediately after you receive them, if you are willing to buy from them at all.

But, there are enough different possible strategies that it is fun to play again and again.

  This might have turned into my family‚Äôs favorite game.  We have a bunch and some really good ones.  It‚Äôs a little too much for my 7-yo son, but my 9-yo daughter loves it, as does my 10-yo and me and my wife.  We got four games for Christmas and we have played this easily ten times this week.  Today I played this game four times back to back.My only issue was a rule that did not seem to be practically explained.  I looked up what people were saying about this rule on BGG and found that it was explained there well.  For all intensive purposes, when you draft tiles, you go around the players and draft until they are ALL taken during each round.  We mistakenly thought that you only drafted once around the table, and that was a round.  Once we got the rules right, I was thankful because this is really a good strategy/puzzle game.  Spiel des Jahres winner is totally justified.

After playing once I know this game is a winner.
","

  First off, we have no missing pieces and no quality issues with any game materials. Everything is in good condition and looks nice.My wife and I both immediately thought of ""Coloretto"" when we started playing. But it is like Coloretto on steroids, with practically an entire additional dimension to it. Once you start playing, the instructions seem relatively simple, but you will soon realize how many things need to be considered to optimize scoring. And we only did a two-player game -- with 3 or 4 players the game would get even more intricate, depending on how many people are willing to play in a more cutthroat fashion.As with any game of this style you can decide to play to build yourself up or to try to bring your opponent(s) down. Additionally, it is the type of game you don't need to worry about having one ""bad"" round early on, because fortunes can change pretty quickly. Frankly, I am a poor sport. But a game like this makes me not care so much about losing because you can remain competitive despite mis-steps here and there (other games are not so forgiving, and tend to make me want to give up).I do think the ""Ages 8 and up"" may be a bit aggressive, but maybe that is only because we have an 8 year old who is a bad sport like her dad, and isn't as easy-going about those special few games where the joy of playing overrides the outcome -- she still just wants to win.  *smile*  I do think an average eight-year-old could get the hang of it after a few plays, through.

This game is FANTASTIC!

  Wow. This game is FANTASTIC! My family plays a lot of board games. This hits the table more than any game I have owned. I bought it for my mom and she is addicted too. It has been played by ages 8-60 and we all love it. I watched a video on YouTube before purchasing and thought it looked so-so, but once I played it I couldn't stop!This is an abstract game. Essentially you draw tiles with an interesting drafting system and place them in rows on your board. The rows have room for 1-5 tiles of one color and when all tiles have been drafted you score the completed rows. You score more for tiles that connect (like Scrabble) and cannot place same colors in rows or columns (like Sudoku).It's simple but there are so many decisions to make! There is a lot of luck in which tiles appear in a round but you can employ different strategies based on available tiles and the number of players.The game is beautiful and the tiles are just amazing! They have a good, solid feel and look stunning on the board. Maybe that adds to the addiction?I prefer this to similar games: Sagrada and Reef. AZUL is a bit easier, but the game play goes faster and seems more satisfying at the end of the day.

It is easy to learn, but the more you get into it the more you start to appreciate the strategy. There is also just the right element of chance to prevent one person from winning all the time (without making you feel like your choices don't matter.)

Great game for parents to play with kids
","

  First off, let's get it out of the way--this is a fun game, very visually pleasing, and the scoring is a sneaky way to get your kid to work on math skills.But I think what's really impressive about this game is that it allows an adult to play the game ""down"" to a kid's level without feeling like you're throwing the game. Simply put: it's a fun game to play, and you can easily turn off your cut-throat long-term strategy brain and just have fun with it, while your kid does her/his own thing--and it doesn't bore you because you're beating the pants off of your opponent, or taking it easy on them.And that's what I really like about this game. Besides the fact there are no dice, no shuffling of cards, no secret hands, no need for randomization or pre-scripted events. You take turns picking tiles from the bag and even if one person is ""stacking"" the factories, since you take turns, you can't guarantee your cheating will help you--or your opponent. My kids have ""favorite"" tile colors, and that's fine.So this game is very replay-able. And even when my son (who isn't a good loser) loses, he had fun building his tiles, and at times he has found a way to ""stick it to me"" in a round so I take a big point loss, and he counts that as a little victory even if he doesn't win the game. My son is under the recommended age, so this game is easy to learn and play. Maybe he doesn't have the best strategy, but that's the best thing about this game--you don't have to have the best strategy to have fun playing it.Plus, it just plain looks pretty.I should note, most of my play has been head-to-head with one or the other of my kids. It gets more complex with more players.

Looks great but that's about it
","

  I've been looking forward to playing this game for awhile. Looks great and I thought it would be a fun strategy game. Unfortunately, its not much of a strategy game. After playing a two player game, we realized that there is no penalty for using the 1 or two square lines to fill in the tiles. This means that its literally a 5 round (5 minute game) to win. There's no strategy involved in finding tiles, trading tiles, stealing tiles. Its literally just picking up tiles and putting them on the board. Winning involves adding up points, but when anyone can end the game at any time, there's no incentive to go for high points. We literally started making up rules to attempt to force the game to be a little bit challenging. For instance, not being able to end the game without making a plus sign of tiles, or an 'x' across the board, etc. Even with that, it was a pretty lackluster experience.The tiles are pretty and the board looks great. It would be nice if the tiny black score keeper block was heavier or magnetized as its really easy to bump/swipe/move it off the board accidentally. The cardboard game boards are thick, but don't lie down completely flat, and this makes that piece sit even more precariously.Overall, this general conclusion about this game is that it is missing something. Not sure exactly what, but there needs to be added element to make this compelling. The tragedy is that this game feels really close to being really good. But without that extra thing, it comes across as half-baked and fairly lackluster.

The rules are easy to grasp and by the end of the first few turns, you‚Äôll feel like you have the hang of it. However, the strategies are complex. You must take risks, pursue a strategy, and keep an eye on your opponents‚Äô moves. Games aren‚Äôt terribly long which is perfect as I find myself demanding rematches after a loss or wanting to improve my high score after a win.The game itself is beautiful giving you the feeling that you are completing a masterpiece as the game goes on.I recommend this game to both serious and casual gamers.

Beginners and Veteran gamers alike can have a good time together playing

  Azul is a 2 to 4 player tile laying game. The game ends after a row is completed, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.For a four player Setup, each player will receive a player board with scoring cube. Nine circle disks called ""factory displays"" will be placed in a circle at the center of the table. On each disk there will be four randomly drawn tiles from the tile bag.GameplayFactory Offer: A player will need to choose a set of same colored tiles from either a ""factory display"" or the center table area of the nine disks. When tiles are chosen from the ""factory display"" the tiles that remain will move to the center table area. When choosing tiles from the center table area, if the player is the first to do this, they will gather a set of one tile type and obtain the first player marker, and go first in the next round. After choosing tiles, players will place their chosen tile/s on their player board in one of the five pattern lines. These pattern lines range from one square to five squares. All tiles must be placed on the same pattern line as players are not allowed to split up their tiles. Any tiles that cannot be place are moved to the Floor Line that gives the player negative victory points for each wasted tile. After all tiles have been chosen this phase will end.Wall-tiling: All players may do this at the same time, players will now move finished Pattern Lines to their respective Wall areas on their player board. Players will start with the One Pattern Line and end on the Fifth Pattern Line. Players will discard excess tiles of completed rows as only one tile is moved. Scoring will be one point for placing a single tile. However, players will score a point for every 1 or more tile that is connected horizontally or vertically. Then finally negative points will be applied from the Floor Line.Preparing the Next Round: If no one has completed a horizontal line of five tiles than another round will begin. The first player will draw four tiles for each ""factory display"", and then place the first player marker in the center table area.End of Game: When a player completes a horizontal row during the Wall-tiling phase the game is over at the end of the round. Players will do one final scoring, and score additional points for complete horizontal lines (2 points), complete vertical lines (7 points), and covering all tiles belonging to one tile type (10 points). The player will the most points is the winner of the game.Azul is a great game for those beginning to get into board games, and veterans that play all the time. The reason being is it is a fast game with some depth. The game goes by fast for first time players, but that speed increases when people play it again. It works great as a filler game, and something lite enough for people to get into without feeling like they need to spend time learning it. The depth of the game comes from how tiles are placed, and how strategic players want to be. That strategy is looking at what tiles they will risk taking in negative victory points to obtain more victory points at the end, or at that moment. The game can also be mean by player choice as individuals can force a player to take on a lot of negative victory points because they were not counting on everyone passing up a set of tiles. Also, players can choose to pay attention to what they are leaving behind because sometimes someone could set someone else up for a terrific play. Azul, again, is a great game for everyone that likes playing board games. It works exceptionally well as a beginner game, but it is not the type of beginner game that intermediate players will have an issue with playing.Teaching the game: Emphasize that players should pay attention to what tiles they are taking in later turns as they can not only setup other players, but they can give themselves a lot of negative victory points. From this, remember that a Pattern Line cannot have the same tile placed that has already been placed on a players board. Also, the first Pattern Line is only one tile, so the game is moving towards ending rather quickly as the average game is 5 to 7 rounds. For even more advance play, the other side of the player board has a blank wall devoid of any tile type. On this side players must choose where to place their tile with the rule being the same tile type cannot be found in one row.

Great family game, easy to learn and difficult to master
","

  Improvements:1. I drew an arrow on a piece of paper and switched the direction of play after each wall tiling. This reduces frustration if the person to your right is looking for the same pieces.2. The instructions could be better at explaining that you are to continue drawing tiles until there are none left before scoring.  It took one confused round before carefully reading the instructions again for this detail.3. Discard into a bowl instead of the box lid, because it's difficult to transfer from the box lid to the bag without dropping tiles on the floor.What I like:- Everyone gets to play on every turn, unlike some games like Catan- It's easy to learn the rules and get started- There's some complexity, strategy, randomness, and chance- Very reasonable price for this attractive and fun game- The number of tiles ""offered"" per round seems well balanced for the 2-player and 4-players games I tested.

  My wife and I love this 2-4 player game called Azul. I typically hate any 2 player games, but this game I'm willing to play with her. I love games that have good replayability and this is one of those games. In addition, I'm always look for ways to modify rules to make game play even better. We love this game, but the original rules do not allow for a very fun game. In the original rules, the game ends when you have one horizontal line (+2pts). The problem is playing with this rule everyone goes for the top line and the game lasts 5 minutes. However, we changed the following rules to add more strategy and to speed up the game:1) the game ends when a player creates one vertical line (+7pts) and allow people to score as many horizontal (+2pts) and all 5 same color tiles (+10pts)2) immediate scoring and therefore we do not wait until all of the tiles in the middle are gone (which allows a player to complete multiple tiles in a row)

  AZUL is a gorgeous piece of work. I've never opened the box without having someone, gamer or ""civilian,"" say OOOOH! AAAAH! When they see it. The rules are reasonably simple, once you explain the two-phase nature of every round of play; however, there is a bit of wonkiness with the scoring. It looks simple but there's enough strategy and variety in it to reward multiple plays.  There's a lot of room within this deceptively simple setup to try different styles of play. Your game experience could be contemplative OR aggressive, depending on you and your opponents' temperaments. It's possible to play this game as a kind of ""multi-player solitaire"" wherein you and your opponents are just trying to make pretty pictures on your own player boards. Or you can go on the attack and do your best to deny your opponents the tiles they need and leave them with a bunch of penalty tiles they are forced to take.If you are just getting further into the board game hobby (moving past ""gateway games"") and getting into something deeper, or perhaps have a friend who is just getting into it, this is a great game to ask for or give as a gift. It's maybe a bit too complex for younger players or for people who are complete novices in the new realm of board games, but, hey, they can always just admire the pretty tiles. I would give it five stars but a) I hardly ever do that unless a game is a stone-cold classic and b) the rule book was not entirely helpful.

Fun new game
","

  We like family games.  Azul came up as one of the best games of the year when we purchased it.  This has become a favorite with family and friends. It is easy to learn, allows conversation during play.  One learns fairly quickly that there is a strategic way to win at this game.  We often get our grandchildren started with games by simply playing with the parts, getting used to the board and tile pieces.  Even our four year old grandson likes making patterns with the tile pieces.  Our eight year old granddaughter asks to play Azul- and she is good at it.  There is an option to the way in which the game is played, using the back side of the game board, making your own patterns.  We have not tried this option but surely it would provide an additional challenge.

Casually competitive, great for families and friends
","

  A great game. Two things stand out to us. First, our children between the ages of 5-9 all learned the game very quickly and enjoy it; because it is so tactile and color based, the youngest at 5 is able to play. It's also quickly taught to friends who might be visiting. The second thing that stands out is that it is ""casually"" competitive. One reviewer described it akin to ""multi-player solitaire,"" and there is a sense that while there is competition, and some cross-player strategy, there's no ""cut throat"" sense when playing; no sending the other player back to Start, or bankrupting them, or stealing their cards, etc. This makes for inner-family play a bit more relaxed!

I forked out the cash to buy my own copy of this game and I don‚Äôt regret the purchase ... but ...
","

  This is one of those games that you play the first time and it‚Äôs fun.  Then you buy it and play it and it‚Äôs fun.  Then you put it on the shelf and maybe play it again once in a while - usually only to introduce other people to it.  Lather, rinse, repeat.Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there is strategy and luck and out-guessing of your opponents.  It is easy enough that most people can pick it up after a few rounds, including mature kids.  But there are also some issues that may turn off some people.  Here are some observations I have made playing it and watching others play:  1) the scoring is confusing at first and can cause strife.  I wish the game instructions had more examples.  2) while some people enjoy the clickety-clack of the tiles and the very manual process of setting up for a round, it can be a little long and slows down play.Those things said, I forked out the cash to buy my own copy of this game and I don‚Äôt regret the purchase, but I should note that I didn‚Äôt pay full price.  For the sales price I paid, I would recommend.  For MSRP, I would really hesitate.

Fun and simple game, once you learn the rules
","

  I bought this because I was looking for a game that just the wife and I could play. The game is actually fairly simple once you learn the rules, but the strategies are varied enough that it keeps it interesting.  My problem with it is, the rule book isn't very well written in my opinion.  It makes the game seem a lot harder than it really is.  The first couple rounds we played wrong because we weren't clear on the instructions.  We thought you refilled the factories after everyone took a turn.  We watched a few videos and then it cleared things up for us and since then the game has been fun.  I have actually been able to play a few rounds with my three year old.  She doesn't understand  the rules well enough to make a decided strategy, but she picks the colors that she likes and then I help her place them on her board.Overall I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game to play with a small group of people or if you are looking for something just for you and a partner to play.

always a good pick
","

  I've got a regular game group that meets weekly. We play light games and heavy games of all different themes and player counts, and when it comes time to decide what to play next, consensus isn't always easy to come by. However, with Azul, there's always enough interest to pull it out and start playing right away. Whether you're looking for a light game or a deep game, Azul fits the bill, because you can play it without thinking much about what you're doing (you PROBABLY won't win that way but you can still have fun), or you can really deep dive into tile counting and hate drafting to mess with your opponents (but it's hard to get mad about that since even if they aren't trying to, your opponents are going to screw your plan for next turn plenty of times). Rounds don't take too long thanks to the constraints of the board, and as you play more games, you start to see why the score tracker goes as high as it does. Easy to see why this game has won awards.

Quick to learn, quick to play, as simple or complex as you make it
","

  First off, my game arrived in factory packaging with no defects or missing pieces - the seller was ""Plan B Games"". All the pieces seem sturdy enough to last for a good long time, including the tiles which are good hard plastic,not hollow or cheap feelingOnto the actual game:Azul is really quick to setup and get playing, with rules simple enough that most brand new players will fully understand it by the end of the first game - my 8 and 12 year old had no problem picking it up quickly. That said, it's sort of like chess in that you can apply strategies of varying depth depending on how well you grasp the possible outcomes of different interactions. Not nearly as complex as chess but you get the idea. This makes it a fun game to play with mixed ages; younger players will happily focus on filling up their boards and are never left out while sharper players can get after each other. And the changing turn order and blind draw gives everyone at last a chance to mess each other up lol.The design is pleasing to the eye and hand and doesn't require a ton of space to play. Games have topped out around 30 minutes and usually less with two players so it's a fun ""rematch!"" game. Great value at just over 20 bucks. Just buy it!

Strategic, fun game!
","

  This is a fun game that‚Äôs competitive, but not overly aggressive as far as needing to be out to get the other players. The premise of the game is simple and allows for conversation while playing, but does require some strategy. It‚Äôs also a relatively fast game so you‚Äôre not playing for hours at a time.One downside is that you should probably have a bag of Starburst on hand, because the playing pieces are very similar in appearance and you‚Äôll be craving them by end of game play.

Really fun game, easy to learn, plays quickly and good for multiple ages
","

  This is a very nice game! The rules are pretty simple, take same colored tiles from the ""factories"" or the center and put them on your board, try to complete different row lengths using the same color tile in each row. At the end of the round you move a tile from the complete row to the ""wall"". You can't have duplicate colors on the wall's rows or columns. Play until someone completes a full row on the wall then do final scoring. Sounds simple and it is but there are strategies! You need to think ahead and watch the other players to possibly block, and try not to get stuck with more tiles than fit on a row otherwise those extras become negative points.I taught this to my wife and teen age daughter separately and each picked it up in about 5 mins! We've had a lot of good games in the past week and we're looking forward to playing it again.  It's taking about 30 mins to play a game with 3 people.

  Easier then it seems!  I had my best friend over for dinner.  After we filled our tummies, we exercised our minds with this little delight.  The directions are looong!  My ADD was working in over drive.  Fortunatly, my best friend was able to explain it to us as she read it.  And we had a ball!  It's a game of strategy.  The game is not over until someone gets a horizontal line.  And just because you are the one who gets a horizontal line does not mean you win.  It's based off of total accumulated points from all rounds.  We played a full game and it took 40 minutes.  Everyone wanted to play again.  Our age ranges were 11, 16 and 30s.  A good time was had by all.  Perfect family game!

  This has a base learning curve to let you play in minutes, but strategy that will leave you perfecting play each time you bring it out. Simple set up and clean up, beautiful tiles and simple scoring system. This will definitely be one of the first games off the shelf in the future. Only complaint is the two of the tiles varieties have no pattern on them, but I believe they are making new sets to remedy this.

  After being introduced to Azul by a family member, we picked up a copy for ourselves and have been enjoying it (and gifting it!) ever since.The game is fun, easy to play, and the production value of the bright, colorful pieces is excellent. Games last just the right amount of time - around 20-30 minutes - and setup is extremely simple.My only (minor) complaint with Azul is that if you don't have someone who can show you how to play, the included rulebook can be just a tiny bit hard to follow at first. I do appreciate that they walk through a round of play and a few different scoring examples, however.If you're looking for an approachable new game to add to your collection, Azul is a good choice. It's one of our new favorites!

Fun game, shoddy packaging.

  The game is a lot of fun. There are many ways to strategize but there's also luck involved. I feel like for the price, the packaging should have been better quality. Two of the boards were pretty warped when I got them and when I tried to gently straighten them out they split because they're made of layered cardboard. Similarly, the box has already split up the corner because it's flimsy and a little too tight. This isn't a major thing, but I feel like also for the price, the tiles should match The colors on the board. Everyone talked about how beautiful the game was, but the primary blue of the tile that doesn't match the board is kind of cheap looking. Again, I'm glad we got the game, but quality could be improved some.

Great Family Weight Game
","

  I really like this game. It's not complicated, so it's easy to teach, but there are still a couple decisions each round where, if you want to, you can think about them and the decisions feel rewarding (you can always just grab tiles and deal with the consequences for those who don't care about decisions). The scoring is a little hard to grok at first, seems like at least 1 person messes it up the first time, but doing scoring together the first couple rounds usually clears it up. I like the feel of the pieces. Everything is good quality. The tiles look/feel good and are a good weight, the cardboard is all thick and feels solid, the scoring cubes are simple and effective, and the first player marker is the same bake-lite material as the rest of the tiles in all new versions (old versions had a cardboard piece that people didn't notice and threw out, then complained there wasn't a first player marker . . . ) To illustrate component quality/durability, I let my 2.5 and 4.5 year olds play with the pieces without worry.

Fantastic for a base game; definitely look into expansions!
","

  This is the base game.  I can't emphasize that enough.  This review will only handle the base game, minus expansions.LEARNING CURVE:  This game is extraordinarily simple and straightforward to learn.  Played once through, it makes plenty of sense and opens doors to more complex rules and gameplay.GAME SPEED:  1-2 hours for 4 players.  Game moves briskly but with obvious early-, mid-, and end-game stages that each have their own strategies and approaches.  Game easily resumed from a paused state if you take a break.GAMEPLAY OVERALL:  Catan is satisfying to play, even more satisfying to win.  As a game best played with a poker face and a good set of bluffing skills, Catan rewards long-term foresight and strategies more than rushed or brute-forced gameplay techniques.  Catan can become repetitive IF and ONLY IF you refuse to play randomly.  I highly recommend players who have a few games under their belt learn to completely randomize the map, starting positions, and resource entitlement for more satisfying experiences.APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS?  Depends on your child.  Children with a knack for puzzles and strategy games will find playing Catan with adults to be very rewarding.  Probably a bit too complex for children to play with each other, however; too many ""honor system"" concepts in play, too easy to cheat each other.APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS?  Gameplay can easily be catered for adults or children with special needs.  Game rules are insanely simple and easily modified for those wanting additional assistance.  Communities online for adapting Catan gameplay are prevalent and easily found.CONCLUSION:  Catan is a fantastically easy game to pick up and learn, but complex and difficult to master.  Catan is a game best suited to be expanded and enhanced, as the base game is truly just the first step into the world of Catan.

  Absolutely do not purchase from a third party seller. Ever.I purchased two copies. One from Amazon and one from a third party. The copy from a third party was seven dollars cheaper. That's because it's a pirated and thoroughly illegal copy.And man what a copy it is. Almost perfect. But look at the photographs attached (pirate copy on the right) and you will see misspellings all over the back of the box like 'strart by revealing Catan's' and 'No two games ard the same.' The colors are slightly different. The pirated copy contained twice as many orange road pieces as it was supposed to and was missing a white road. Additionally, the pieces were rough.Outside of that the pirated copy contained stickers, promotional material, the works! Very deceptive.

The ""Candy Land"" of Strategy Games
","

  I like it, but it's not quite a five-star game for me because I've since discovered other games which I enjoy playing more than this one.Pros:- Popular enough that many people already know how to play, and easy enough to teach those who don't- ""Gateway"" game for empire-building and resource management types of games- Involves some strategy and risk managementCons:- Winner/loser inertia: As you build more things, your production tends to accelerate. If you fall behind, it becomes progressively harder to catch up.- Occasional ""dead"" turns: Sometimes a player's turn consists of rolling the dice and nothing else, because they didn't get any resources since their last turn. Two of those in a row makes it difficult to stay engaged, and it's more likely to happen early in the game when that matters most.- Dice rolls dominate the game: The best-laid strategies can be overpowered by a stretch of reasonably bad luck.In my opinion, Ticket to Ride or Splendor would both be superior options for a ""gateway"" game, because they both offer greater strategic depth, faster gameplay, easier setup, simpler rules, and comparable price. Both of those games also have plenty of randomness, but in both cases, you're still playing and engaged on every turn, even when luck isn't on your side.The relatively recent Explorers and Pirates expansion to Catan fixes many of my issues with the game, but that expansion is basically a new game which uses some of the original components and game mechanics, and it's significantly more expensive.

The board edges don't even fit together properly making the game hard to setup and the hexagons are poorly cut and do not fit inside properly. I have to force the sides and hexagons in to get them to stay together. Some of the hexagons are printed poorly as well as you can see in the pictures. The pieces that came with it were in terrible condition as well, several roads were chipped and looked like they were cut in half and several of the house/cities were chipped and don't even stand up. I also was sent a yellow set of pieces which is supposed to be orange, and the yellow set was missing 3 roads as there is supposed to be 15 roads per color.

Game missing pieces, composed of mismatched version of components, QC issues

  Good game but seller provided a mismatched set, with missing pieces.It looks like this set might have been composed of spare parts harvested from different batches or used sets. I think this because about half the cards are slightly off-color. Not a big deal.The second problem is that the outer board pieces do not connect properly. Regardless of whether they are joined end-to-end according to the printed numbers or not, the pieces just do not fit together. We have to play with the outer tiles disconnected in one place so that the resource tiles will all fit in. Not a huge deal but pretty disappointing considering I purchased this as ""new"" and expected it to work completely.The third problem is that the white player's five settlements are missing. We play with small white beads instead. Disappointing.One last minor issue is that since the compentents are from mismatched sets, we have a yellow player but an orange reference card. Sometimes confuses new players who setup the game. ""where's the orange player? Where's the yellow card?""Minus one star for each defect.

  My family loves this game! I also purchased the Catan 5-6 Player Extension - 5th Edition, and the Catan Scenarios Helpers of Catan card pack. Together they make endless hours of fun for us and the kids. The game involves strategy, making trade deals, and there are several ways to win. Each of my kids has their own strategy to win and it's fun to see them learning about honesty, shrewd bargaining, and exploring new ways to try to win. Another thing I like about Settlers of Catan is it's more about achieving a personal goal than ""beating"" the other players; the first person to get 10 ""Victory Points"" is the winner. The rules are easy to learn, but mastery of the game takes a long time. This is a great alternative to having the kids play video games or use their ""devices"". Worth every penny, the game pieces are well made and look great. Definitely add this game to your family's game collection!

  The game looks like fun but the instructions are woefully inadequate and assume and awful lot of knowledge for first time players. We had to go online and do a tutorial before we could figure out how to play.

We thought we new what the road pieces were but the instructions said to take 15 of them in your color. Since there were only 14 of the orange and the blue pieces, this made it even more confusing and more difficult to get started. We had to paint two of the extra red and white pieces (we had 16 each of them) before we could get started.At this point, we still haven't been able to actually play the game since we're still learning how to get started.Once we watched a tutorial and figure out how to play, it was a lot of fun and we're looking forward to getting better at strategy.

Fun game

  So maybe we all know about Catan already, so I'm not going to do an extensive review. If you're wondering if this is the game for you, I'll give you two answers:1. If you're a very competitive gamer and like Eurogames, you'll really like Catan.2. If you're not a very competitive player but still like Eurogames, change a few of the rules and you'll still really like Catan.If you don't like Eurogames, you may not like this. The game revolves around you strategizing placement of buildings and roads to earn more resources to build more buildings and roads to achieve a determined set number of points to win. How much you compete with/against other players is kind of based on each player's personality. I don't like games where players try to sabotage one another, so I hate playing this game with certain types of people; on the other hand, when playing with people like me, we have a great time playing and competing for the goal without trying to sabotage the other.I really like this game and think it has a lot of replayability, especially when you throw in the expansions. Are there rules I would change? Yes, and I do every time I play, and I enjoy it every time. Just watch out who you're playing with! ;)

Removing the individual pieces resulted in a number of pieces ripping (note that I took great care in removing them)

  I am extremely upset with my purchase. The overall quality of what I received would be barely worth $10, much less $45. To start out, the game box came damaged around the corners and edges. Removing the individual pieces resulted in a number of pieces ripping (note that I took great care in removing them). NOTHING is uniform: the roads are cut horribly and look more like my attempts at arts and crafts in kindergarten; I received three complete sets of red, orange, and white settlements, cities, and roads, but my fourth set consists of 4 yellow cities, 5 orange(!!!) settlements, and 15 blue roads. Is that something I can fix with a paint brush? You bet. Should I have to fix the pieces of a newly purchased game? Absolutely not. Additionally, 2/4 white cities are discolored and poorly cut.I've grown to love Catan and will be moving out of state soon, so I felt that it was time to purchase the game for myself since I won't be able to mooch of friends any longer. I had hoped this $45 purchase would allow me to bring the joy of the game to my new home and share it with new friends; I will not be able to do that with this set.A warning/suggestion: buy directly from the company that makes the game, not from Amazon.**EDIT:After further inspection, the border pieces also do not fit together properly.

  ¬†Catan is the gateway board game for many. That's a good thing because game nights seem to be the thing more and more people are doing. I love Catan, I think this game is well balanced, easy to learn and really fun to play. I've gotten friends and family members who've only ever played games such as Card Against Humanity to not only play, but truly enjoy it.As mentioned the game is easy to pick up and the rules are straight forward. I typically recommend watching a YouTube video about the rules if no one in the group has played. There are some great videos under 10 minutes explaining all the rules.Setting up the game takes only a few minutes. Although, when the game is brand new it will take just as bit longer as you have to open everything for the first time. Ahh new game smell!It's highly recommend that you play on a flat surface and on a table when possible. There are a decent amount of pieces overall. Bags are included to put all the pieces away at the end.This game makes such a great gift for many occasions such as a birthday, anniversary, Christmas, Valentine's, or even just because!There are expansions to the game as well, but this original game is a solid start to what very well could become an addiction.If you found this review helpful, make sure to hit that 'helpful' button down below.

The game board can be set up differently every time you play, this allows a different game each time and for players to employ different strategies.  I love the solid feeling game pieces.  The game is made very well which makes it more enjoyable to us and gives us a stronger desire to keep the game in good condition.Cons:Setup takes longer than the average board game.  still less than 5 minutes but hey, I wanted to write something under con.  The really only con i see to this game is that you are limited to four players or less unless you buy the expansion pack.Summary:Great game for people who like board games that involve some strategy.  We play with people who range in age from 8 to 72, enjoyable for all so far.  We put in about 10 games the first weekend we finally opened the box!

This game is a blast!
","

  LOVE this game!  We quickly learned the rules which, to my old head at least, at first sounded rather complicated - it's anything BUT.  Lots of fun to get the family around a board game again, and away from the video games and cell phones.  The strategy is simple: collect resource cards (sheep, brick, stone, straw, and lumber) in order to build settlements, expand roads, and eventually build cities.  Resources can be traded with other players and rewards can be claimed (longest road, largest ""army"") and as you work your way through the process of developing the land, the first player to reach ten points wins.  This is perfect for three to four players; five or more players can play as well, but the game play is pretty crowded and fast at that point, so you would be well advised to purchase the extension pack at that point.My initial thought when looking at this game was that the price seemed a bit high for what I thought was a complicated Parcheesi (hah!) but we played a couple of games with my daughter and son-in-law, and we were hooked.  Set aside an hour or two for a game, but don't be surprised to find you've spent six hours on three or four games.  It's addicting, and it's a blast.

You don't need to be a nerd to enjoy this game
","

  I was introduced to this game in college and loved it. I recently bought it for my new family. My parents love playing it with me. My husband who does not like playing board games seemed to tolerate it fairly well.Things I love:Bartering. You can trade with other people in the game to get a better trade deal than the standard. I love this! In college I even tried to barter things outside of the game to get what I wanted, which was extremely pleasing to me and very displeasing to the German who wasn't a part of the deal. I love this part. Will it help you out or boost another player's ability to build...can you get a better rate or stick to trying to get a better rate through building. LOVE THIS part.I like building things. It is fun. Less frustrating than ticket to ride where you feel completely devastated if someone cuts you off from your intended route.Thorough rules. I hate it when the game doesn't tell you what to do in a situation. And then there is an online community to tell you too if you are doing it wrong. lol.Every time is different.Things I don't like:It looks a little daunting and confusing at first. So new time players are a little less hesitant to play with you.

Avoid! Counterfeit version of Catan
","

  A very impressive, but still definitely counterfeit version of Catan. The border pieces are slightly wrong so that the playing tiles are loose. Only someone who had never played Catan could consider this acceptable. The wooden pieces fall between the tiles and the whole board moves constantly. It is so annoying when playing the game, and I am very unhappy. The playing cards are also noticeably thinner than they are supposed to be and the colors are slightly different (compared with the genuine 5-6 player expansion that I got from 3rd party seller Shopville.com).I contacted Asmodee, with photos (that I can't seem to attached here) and they confirmed that it is a counterfeit version. I do not live in the US, so none of the Return options are possible for me. Very disappointed Amazon.com!

Must play board game
","

  We've played Catan with the whole family and everyone that has played it so far ends up getting a copy because of how fun it is. It takes a couple of games to understand the concept and a few games to fully know how to play it. So far my 7 year old nephew and 78 year old grandma have been able to understand the game. It's fun playing the base game but with the 6 player expansion it becomes even better. Every game the board gets shifted around so you're always playing with a new board which requires different strategies to play. I would really recommend this game to anyone that would like to try a new board game. So far we've given away 3 copies and another 4 families have bought it after playing it with us.Pros:Replay value is greatNot difficult to learnUp to 6 players with expansionCons:Can take an 1-1.5 hrs to play a game depending on how many people are playing and how slow they areBoard pieces are made of cardboard and can be easily damaged

Quick Family Favorite but Allow Learning Curve Time
","

  Once we got the ball rolling, the family quickly adopted this game as the new favorite. Before sitting down to play, you have to separate each of the many game pieces. Be careful here and read the advice in the pamphlets that come with the game to prevent damaging the cardboard/paper pieces. I recommend that you sit with some YouTube videos on game play to understand how the game flows. We tried initially through just reading the documentation. It was ok, but once we watched a video we realized we mis-read some sections and the game flowed much better after the video. We have only played the game with the standard configuration (which balances the board), but there is the option to randomize the tiles. I think we will be moving to the randomized version to mix up the starting strategies the players keep repeating. Love that there are player expansion options available for purchase, as well.

","

  An excellent game that is not long and tedious as monopoly can get (there is a clear end of the tunnel/goal to get to and you can see when the game is coming to a close).The goal is to strategically build places along the right resources, build roads and settlements based on resources . But to get the resources- ah here is where the strategy is- the factors are 1. putting yourself in squares where the chances of rolling that number on dice is high and also figuring out what resources is best to monopolize to and where to build near to, so that one can expand easily. Great game for ages 12 and older- may be a little trickier for those who are younger. Does not require much language understanding and can be learned within 1 game.

Love It So Much I Made it With Legos! Read On for Game Tips and House Rules from a Life-Long Fan
","

  (Off-the-bat Disclaimer: When you open up the box containing your Catan game, I'm afraid that it won't contain the Lego Catan board displayed in my photos. The photos represent a Lego creation that I made on my own for fun. I figured there were enough photos of the actual game pieces attached to other reviews, and that nothing else could better showcase how much I absolutely love this game!)I have played Catan hundreds and hundreds of times over the years, ever since my parents first ordered it when I was a child. Now I love playing it with my wife and family friends, and we even maintain a long-term score sheet to keep track of who has won the most games, and how many points each of us won per game (see photo). I am a full-on unashamed ""Catan Supernerd"", and look forward to playing it hundreds of more times. Here are some highlights:BRIEF SYNOPSIS: In this game, you and your fellow players assume the roles of rival bands of settlers who are racing to populate and develop the island of Catan. You strategically choose where to place your first settlements, based on what resources you can expect to harvest/mine from the surrounding countryside, and expand from there! However, to fully expand your influence on the island, you need to engage in resource trades with other players to strengthen your army, build roads, and construct settlements and cities. The game ends when one player accumulates 10 points and earns the coveted title of ""Settler of Catan!""AGE RANGE: 8-108. Easy to learn for all ages!TIME TO PLAY: 60 minutes for beginners (or games with ""really bad islands"" [only a few wood/ore/brick available]), but can go as quick as 30 minutes for experienced players.BEST ELEMENTS OF GAMEPLAY:-Simplicity: Probably my favorite thing about Catan is that it's so simple, but its randomness (discussed below) makes it so it never gets old! There are literally only four things you can do throughout the game: build roads, construct settlements, upgrade your settlements to cities, and buy ""development cards"" (like wild cards that help you.) You can learn how to play this game in 15 minutes, but it will never, ever get old.-Randomness: The island of Catan changes every time you play, with different placements of resources and ports between games, along with different probabilities that each resource will be rolled. One of the keys to each game is determining which resource(s) will be scarce and planning your builds accordingly.-Other-Player Interaction/Trades: You simply cannot win at Catan without trading with other players! It's so fun to see how much you can get for your rare resources, even though you're constantly worrying that the trades you make will help your opponents more than they help you. That's part of the fun!SUGGESTED ""HOUSE RULES""-Full Randomization: The game recommends an ""A-R"" order for the 18 numbers that determine which dice rolls are associated with each resource, but we prefer to assign numbers to resource tiles completely randomly. This makes for a more dynamic game, since you can have settlements that simultaneously touch two ""8"" hexagons, for example.-No Robber: Rather than playing with the robber (an attack feature that comes up whenever a ""7"" is rolled), we like to make sure that everyone meets the required 7-card limit and then re-roll the dice. Then, when someone plays a Knight Development Card, they get to pick a free resource from the bank.-Avoiding the 7+ Card Trap: When we have hands that we REALLY don't want to lose, we give the player whose turn it is whatever cards we need to get our hand back down to 7. It's like taking out an insurance policy on your hand, but you have to be careful because it can tip the scale and give your opponent a power turn!-Future Trades: When I really need to make a trade happen, I like to offer my opponents available resources in my hand while also promising them a resource that I'll get later. For example, ""If you give me a brick, I'll give you a sheep now and also my next wood.""I could go on and on with additional strategies and quirks of the game, but suffice it to say here that this is one of my very favorite board games and I look forward to playing it for years to come. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Happy Settling!

","

  My family adores this game! We play by slightly different rules:1, we rotate the numbers every 10 minutes- outside clockwise, inside counterclockwise.2, if a seven is rolled, the person has the choice of rolling again, or pulling a single resource card from the bank. We don't use the robber at all- it caused too much contention.3, in order to make the games shorter (2 hours per game üò±), we only build roads leading to ports where we can trade.We kept all other rules. It's addicting: Age of Empires, almost, except without the computer or the ability to attack your enemies towns & tear them down!

Like the Most Boring version of Monopoly on earth
","

  So two of us have played this game twice now, each time at 2 1/2 hr in length. Once in a cabin in the woods.  We feel we have given it a good chance and find it INCREDIBLY BORING. We just don't get how this game could be the best selling game of all time around the world. It's tedious. It's slow. It's boring. It's a time waster and we found ourselves in a circular series of moves that at no point brought either of us any satisfaction. In fact, the ""winner"" was so happy to be done with the effing game and had no desire to brag or do a victory dance. It was more like, ""Finally! It's done."" Way too expensive of a game to produce this kind of response.Reminded us of an extremely boring game of Monopoly--but Monopoly is high octane and loads more fun compared to this!We are so perplexed by its draw that we are going to do some on line research and see how we are missing all the ""fun"" and ""addiction"" folks in other reviews went on about. Maybe because it was only two of us playing???Save yourself the $44 bucks. Just buy Monopoly. You'll have more fun. And you know how Monopoly can feel intermindable sometimes...multiply that by 10,000,000x.

  CATAN CATAN CATAN, where do I even start with you man?This was the first board game that truly got my board game collecting hobby started. The first time my friend introduced me to the game, we played for 2 days non-stop. I missed school because of this game! Having so much fun with a simple game, I decided to pick up a copy for myself from the local store. I introduced my friends to it and it was an instant hit. (they all bought a copy for themselves as well). Unfortunately, my old 4th edition copy got lost and was never found. I decided to get this one to replace that lost one. Boy oh boy, I am happy. I got the game for an AMAZING price (it was on sale for less than a day) and everything was in order. Everything was perfect. It has already been played a good number of times and I even got the expansion pack to go with it.

Maybe the best game of all time?
","

  I have been playing Settlers of Catan for over 15 years and while many other games have come and gone, I still think this is my favorite game of all time.  This is a great strategy game that isn't hard to learn, but like an onion there are many levels to peal back.  While the game is pretty easy to learn, the strategy is what makes it so fun.  There is no one perfect strategy, which means every game can be different.  We change the rules sometimes and play to 12 which makes games go a little longer and requires you to use more strategy to win. I have probably played this games close to 500 times and I really never get sick of it. Being a strategy game, it is definitely not for everyone.  I have probably introduced 20-30 people to this game and only a handful didn't love it, which is understandable.  If you have never tried it then you should give it a go because it really is awesome.  I also love the updated board and pieces as my old Settlers version is pretty ratty and drab.  Great game and if you watch you can often get it on sale for around $20-25.

cool game for learning what you hate about your friends, overpriced
","

  I feel like it needs something, and not one of those weird expansions. To win, you must be cunning, but not so much that everyone gangs up to make sure you don't win.DON'T even BOTHER reading the rules if you don't know how to play, because they're only written to provide clarifications upon the inevitable ensuing arguments about the rules. You will need a worthy and patient veteran to explain how to start a game. Because this is a game that involves both strategy - PARTICULARLY at the SETUP part before 'regular gameplay' starts - AND luck, you will either be extremely unlucky, or extremely lucky that you are not the extremely unlucky one in your first game.Yes, this is similar to Risk in the way that one is competing for finite resources on a shared field. But instead of dice rolls determining the outcome of battles, dice rolls determine your income of resources. And instead of choosing an ally or enemy to attack and conquer, you make trade requests to fulfill your construction which awards points. It's diplomatic in a different way. Veteran Catan players who are consistently paying attention could probably have a quick game under 40 minutes, but any game involving newbies will require a lot of explaining before the game can even begin, and then strategizing is another issue after that.

  It's Catan. If you've played it you either got it or you didn't really. It's pretty fun, seems pretty simple on it's surface. If you turn a blind eye/ear to the fantasy of occupying some magically empty land with just sheep, wood, bricks, wheat and stone to gird you it's a super fun play. Fair warning though it is a game that can move towards Monopoly-ish friendship destroying. You can get a really bad run and it sucks. If you can't take the monster hit of the dice just hating you, maybe pass.

  There is some luck involved depending on the how the die roll. Equal playing field as everyone is victim or rewarded by the die. I like how the rules allow for a level playing field giving opportunity to all and what they pick as their starting and ending choices. It can move fast or be more thought provoking depending on whom you are playing. We enjoy it very much. Unless you played my sister... she had super powers over most games though.  We played this while she was going through chemo, wanted to keep her wits about her and laugh and let others know she was and would always be a force to be reckoned with. She lost her battle with cancer but she kicked our butts and made sure we knew she would always win no matter what. It is a good game very grateful she taught me it and I taught my family. We even bought the JR. version for our young ones.

  The game itself if amazing, get it! It appears very complicated at first glance and that was a turnoff for me and my family,but after one play-through, we are all addicted to Settlers of Catan. The included rule book is easy to read and very helpful.The only problem I had was missing pieces which we discovered during the first game (missing 5 orange roads). I am returning the game to Amazon, but I already ordered a replacement so we can get back to playing.My last comment is regarding the quality of the cards; they show signs of wear (fraying and denting of corners and edges) after very little game-play.

  Been playing a licensed themed version called Settlers of Caanan for years and finally decided to upgrade to the full version. I was impressed with be the quality of everything in this set - nice, wooden roads and settlements, sturdy board and hex pieces, extensive time box- Except the resource cards. They're printed on light, flimsy, card stock that I was almost afraid to touch. They feel like something that would come in a happy-meal freebie. Compared to the rest of the game they stuck out like a sore thumb.In fact, I grabbed the resource cards from the Caanan game and subbed them out before we even started playing.

It is a 3-4 player game but they have come out wth expansions as well to be able to add more players, or to be able to access the ocean, they even have a Game of Thrones expansion. They game is really simple, you just have to get used to it, but there is a lot of strategy and skill that goes beyond the basics of the game. A great game to sit down with friends and play. I finally bought my own board game since my wife saw an episode of Tabletop with Will Wheaton and that played this game.

Resource based game adaptable to any genre, age, and location
","

  Catan is simply one of the simplest historically themed resource games around.  Takes up little space (a card table size area) and only suitable for 2-4 players. Three to four is best considering the options that the game creates on its randomness. That is the charm of the game: not overly complex, simple rules and random configurations helps keep the game on a level playing field for all ages (suggest 7-8+). Can be mixed with other games (take Diplomacy theme and apply it to resourcing...likely why there is a GOT, Roman, Barbarian, Viking, etc. versions). Small enough to fit in a day-pack or book-bag and road/hotel worthy.

  My title says it all for me.  If you like a game that really engages you toward a goal that involves strategy, comprehensive thinking, a bit of suspense and some luck, but that does make wiping out an opponent the main point of the game, then this game may be just right for you.  I do wish it could be effectively payed by only two, but that's not an inherent drawback to the game.  I've played Monopoly all my life, and always will, but this game is actually more interesting with many more possible outcomes.  Like the old Alka-Seltzer ads use to say: ""Try it, you'll like it!""

  Settlers of Catan is absolutely one of the best board games you could buy.GROUP PLAY - 5/5This game is PERFECT for groups of 3-4 people. You can play a competitive game in anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half! There is so much variety possible, it makes the game feel fresh every time! My wife and I have a few friends we play with every week. It's become one of the highlights of our week! Catan has helped us make friends, even when our competitive spirits get wildly out of control!PLAYING TIME - 5/5I feel like Catan hits that sweet spot for game duration. I have played games as short as 15-20 minutes, and as long as 2 hours. Either way, time just flies by! Our average game time has been around one hour, and we have played probably in the realm of 100 games. You should have a similar experience, especially once you and your opponents have a firm grasp on the rules and flow of the game.OVERALL - 5/5Catan is a fun, yet competitive board game that will both bring out the wild competitor in you and bring you closer to your friends! I highly recommend this game, especially to those of you who love board games. This has become a staple for our family and friends.

  Got the game as a birthday present for our teenage son, who played it before and mentioned that he liked it. I am not a fan of games with many pieces and long playtimes, I like streamlined games like backgammon, mancala, RummyCub.  Therefore I had my doubts if we would enjoy this new addition to our game library. And after a month playing it - we are totally hooked! The first couple of games took 90 - 120 min. to finish, but once we all got used to it, things sped up, and the full round usually takes less than 60 min. The record was 30 min.  Our 12 y.o. likes playing the Settlers of Catan, and won a couple of games. Different strategies, dice rolls and development cards make the game variable and unpredictable. We enjoy it so much that recently got the first expansion - the Seafarers. The game is very exciting, beautifully made, and a pleasure to play.

  This game effectively combines elements of Monopoly, casino craps, and Risk. After setup the gameplay is simple enough that a first-time player can win; however, there is enough strategy and minor details to the game to keep your family brainiacs addicted.Here are a few findings that we noticed after over 12 hours of gameplay. Development cards: we found that players who focused on buying development cards instead of expanding their territory almost always won. We cannot tell if this is a flaw in the game's design or if the ability to buy the most development cards relates to the player's superior placement of her pieces at the start.The amount of space on the board is the reason for the 3-4 player designation. With three you rarely compete with others for space, but with four it feels cramped.It is absolutely crucial that you start with the recommended setup and that you follow the recommendations for randomizing the board. A poor setup almost guarantees that the first player will win.Overall, the game is not perfect but it is the best game for adults that my family and I have ever played.

Great game, fun times
","

  I love this game and I haven't played since college. I am having some guys over this weekend and I decided to order this to setup. The box is more sturdy then most games now a days and it is packaged very well. You have to pop out all the land pieces and sort the houses and roads. There is a very descriptive guide book with a set of rules and an almanac for looking up specific information so you don't have to sort through the rules. They also have built a phone app that lets you learn the game on your phone by playing so I sent them the link to that and they learned ahead of time since they've never played before. The game itself has a sort of Civilization, turn based strategy sort of feel to it. There is no direct fighting, but you gather resources to build your empire and trade with other people. You have to try to balance the trades because you need to help yourself without helping others too much. I wouldn't suggest this for a casual board game player, it is a bit more involved, but it doesn't take too much to learn it and there is a high ceiling for skill once you get the hang of it. So people who love strategy will go crazy. One of my favorite games of all time and this version was well done.

Every game is different and so fun!

  I‚Äôve heard about this game for a while and finally purchased as a gift for my niece. We have SO MUCH FUN playing this. Every game is different and we spent the holidays with the 12, 13 & 15 year olds soundly beating us. It takes a second to process the trade aspect but this game is fun and challenging and a great teacher for learning strategy for trading and building and managing your resources.  We are getting the expansion pack ASAP, which is the only downfall...only four can play at a time (although we played as teams).  Love love love this game.

Gameplay gets a 5-star, but missing pieces made it a 4 for me.
","

  This is absolutely my favorite board game. It is really easy to learn, has lots of different aspects to it, and because of the changing game board it feels like you are never playing the same game. I absolutely love it! I wanted to give this game a 5-star, but I was really disappointed to find that it was missing a lot of the red pieces which really makes this a three player game since we don't have the pieces we need for the 4th. That's a pretty major problem for a fairly pricey game, but it just didn't seem worth it to send the whole thing back. Since I mostly just play it with my son anyway, we've made due without the missing pieces. I've seen we aren't the only ones who have had this problem too, so I would check/count your game pieces carefully if you do decide to order this game.

Best board game I've ever bought
","

  Catan really does board gaming right, but I'll leave that alone and just say youtube it. The pieces come as advertised. Sturdy packaging. I've owned the game for approx 7 months and the only wear so far is on a couple of resource cards because a 'certain' player in the house just doesn't like getting robbed. I expect this game to last for many more years and remain just as fun as the first day we got it. The only thing you may want is to get some drawstring pouches. The plastic ziplock bags it comes with are flimsy as expected and you'll end up wanting extras.

The board doesn't connect
","

  We bought this as a Christmas gift a few years back for our dad, but we never had time to sit down and explain how to play it together.  With the pandemic shutting everything down, we finally found time to play, only to find out that the outside lining doesn't hardly connect, and if you do manage to get it to connect then the tiles don't all fit inside. We literally have to use the board disconnected on two corners in order to get the tiles in to play. Super disappointed with the quality because we have loved this game so much individually, but the game we got makes it difficult to play.

Excellent classic game that everyone should try!
","

  Me and my husband enjoy playing board games and we were not new to Catan, in fact, it has been one of our favorite games since we got into the board game world. We already owned the ""Settlers"" and ""Rivals"" versions of Catan and when we learned of the Black Friday deals on board games, we decided it was the time to have our own version of this game as well (especially since we used to play with some friends and their copy, so us recently moving into another city also played as a factor to buy it).As for the game itself, Catan offers a great balance between strategy and competitive gameplay. While luck is almost always a factor in boardgames and Catan is not the exception (dice rolling involved), the game feels more guided and affected by your strategy and decisions rather than by luck, which is good, since this makes the game more compelling and adds weight to the decisions that you make throughout the game. There is also a trading component that allows you to interact with the other players, which is great for stirring some fun arguments and debates. While this game has a competitive approach, it doesn't pit the players against each others through direct confrontation (which is welcomed if you are not looking for an aggressive game where everyone ends up mad at each other), it plays more like a race in which you need to focus on your strategy while keeping watch of the opponents and overall it is extremely fun. It has simple enough mechanics for beginners, but they are also very compelling for more experienced players, specially when you start to play with the randomized board map. It is not a surprise that this is still regarded as a classic game even though it came out a long time ago.The materials and details of the cards, boards and pieces are excellent. It is worth mentioning that one of the ""settlement"" wood pieces was chipped when we opened the box. While this didn't affect the use or gameplay experience and understanding that there are errors expected in manufacturing processes, we still decided to send a note to the customer service address provided by the game developers (not through Amazon) and they responded very quickly and efficiently, and within a week or so we received a replacement piece on the mail, so extra points to the customer service. Even if you are not looking to get deep into the board game community, Catan is a must if you enjoy playing games with friends or family. And even if you plan to further try more games, most likely you will always be glad to revisit this wonderful game.

Its like Monopoly, without the money
","

  Catanor Settlers of Catan.What a magical game this is. Its like Monopoly, without the money, headaches, fighting, suspending the game, or sitting around for four hours waiting for people to make a deal. Seriously, the designers thought of everything, The map is visually pleasing, if not a bit mundane to put together. The concept of building and expanding your kingdom, often at the dismay of your neighbors will never cease to bring a smile to my face. The compressed board or cardboard pieces can take a bit of punishment  as well. This game is even great for younger kids to team up with adults so they can get in the habit of buying and selling resources and expansions. It helps with the concepts of buy and sell that young children often struggle with.

Totally Unique and Thought-Provoking Party Game
","

  This is a really clever party game, never played anything like it. There are a TON of cards with a great variety of ‚Äúscales‚Äù from simple (hot to cold, boring to exciting) to funny (hairy to hairless, smelly in a good way to smelly in a bad way) to pop culture (Slytherin to Gryffindor, light side to dark side) to intelligent (non-partisan to partisan). We played this tonight with our 4 and 6 yr old kids. We definitely had to stick with only the simple scale cards but they actually understood the concept and really enjoyed it.  The discussions were fun and the moment of reveal was super exciting.The quality of the game is very high, the plastic pieces are all thick. I was a little nervous about my kids handling it but as long as you teach them how to do it correctly it seems pretty solid. My only complaint is the score marker pieces are cardboard making them vulnerable to bending and liquids.I think playing this with a group of outgoing and fun adults would be a total blast! I will update review once we do that.

Certain to be one of my most played games of 2020 - even with 2 players!
","

  This is a great game. At the time of this review, I have logged 15 plays of this game.Quick summary of how the game works. You get a category that is some sort of continuum like from ""bad actor"" to ""great actor"" and then you get a secret place somewhere randomly on that range that you have to get your team to guess.  Then you have to come up with a clue that tries to get your team to guess that same place on the wheel. It's really easy to think of an actor who is really great or really bad, right? But what if you need to come up with an actor who is midway between good and bad. And will your team select the same spot?1) The slidey mechanism to hide the secret spot on the wheel works great.2) This game is incredibly replayable.  There are some cards in this deck that I've remarked ""wow, you could play a whole game using just this card.3) It's very easy to explain when you have the wheel in front of your to show people. If my explanation above didn't make precise sense, that's ok. Once you have the wheel in front of you and do an example, people get it immediately4) Surprising, the 2 player co-op version of the game is great. There are not many party games where you can say that.  How the 2 player version works is you go through 7 cards and get as many points as possible. BUT ALSO if your partner guesses the clue exactly right, you get to add another card to the deck. So it's very fun to see just how high of a score you can get. We have had some terrible scores and we have had some amazing scores.This is a wonderful game and a very novel idea.

Fun party game - collaborative & competing team modes are both fun
","

  Bought this game because my friend recommended it's great for parties. It's very easy to learn and play. I'm a big fan of Codename pictures and this kinda/sorta requires the same logic, but is a lot more approachable/moves a lot faster - i.e. it doesn't require nearly as much time to think of a description if you are the player tasked with giving a clue. I've played with multiple groups and everyone enjoyed playing. The collaborative team play can be as fun as the competitive play.

","

  This is an awesome game!  It's a lot of fun trying to find the right clue that will guide your team to score, so it's great for creative players.  If a player picks a card that they find too difficult, you can allow players to use either side of the card, their choice.  You can play with a large number of people, depending on how many players you're comfortable with on a team (considering that they have to discuss their guess before presenting it).  We played with 4 on a team and the game was a bit short, so some players only got to be ""the Psychic"" once.  But you can always play again, since it's quick enough, or simply play to double the score that the scoring track allows.

The follow-up hit to Monikers!

  So Monikers is one of my favorite games (look it up if you haven't heard of it). So when I heard that Alex was designing another game, my interest was immediately piqued. Add that to the fact that he partnered with Wolfgang Warsch (The Mind, The Quacks of Quedlinburg), I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. And it did not disappoint!This is a play on one of those ""get your friends to guess the word"" game but instead there is a ""spectrum"" of areas and you are trying to guide your team to the correct area of the range through a clue. There is a lovely plastic dial that has quite the table presence and serves its function perfectly.It's been awhile since I have had a party game hit with my group like Wavelength did. Expect a lot of laughs and interesting conversations on what is and isn't a sandwich. It is one of my favorite party games of the last few years.

Fun Party Game for the Family

  This game will have you trying to figure out where on the wavelength a word exists between two polar opposite items. Only in a game like this will you be arguing about where Oprah exists on a scale from Evil to Good. I mean, she is certainly on the Good side, but is she the most good thing out there? The clue giver didn't say something like Gandhi, so potentially not all of the way to the good side, but where then would Oprah fall? She did give a bunch of people a car which is pretty great.The conversations are so ridiculous and fun which makes this a fantastic party game. There are options for everyone playing on the same team or having two teams which makes it good for a large variety of player sizes. If you are a fan of Codenames, this game has a lot of similarities to that game while still being very unique.

  My game group and I discovered this at Dice Tower West and absolutely loved it. It's very simple to learn and so fun to play with a group of friends. One bonus is that the player count doesn't really matter.  I think it says it plays with 2, but I would say 4 or up would be most fun - the more the merrier for this game, actually.It's one of the best type of group party games where the scores don't really matter and we just play until we don't feel like playing anymore.  It also doesn't require that you actually do anything silly, which my group does not typically go for. It's all about the discussion of the spectrum that you're trying to get your team to guess. The quality is great and has very well made components.My ONLY criticism is not game-related - I hate the way it looks.  Don't let the hideous box cover art fool you though, it's a great game and worth the buy.

Good kids' game, poor for adults
","

  This thing looks like a fischer price toy, and it plays like 'Hot and Cold.' You want to play this game at home? It's basically just this: Give everyone a card consisting of two opposing concepts, like SMALL/LARGE. Then secretly tell the cluegiver a random number on a scale of 1-20. (Let's say it's 17).THEN, tell the cluegiver to think of a clue that helps people guess ""17"" on the spectrum, given that one end of the spectrum corresponds to SMALL and the other corresponds to LARGE. A good clue might be ""CHRIS FARLEY"" or ""MICROSOFT,"" since both are on the high end. After the cluegiver's team takes a guess, the other team can win a point if they correctly identify the first team's guess as too low or high. The first team gets 4 points if they guess 17 on the dot, 2 points if they guess 16 or 18, and no points otherwise.It just ends up feeling highly arbitrary whether you nail the precise point on the spectrum or not.  You are just trying to gauge someone's subjective opinion, but it's so handwavy because there's no real concrete information, just hunches. Is Microsoft a ""17"" or ""18"" on the SMALL/LARGE scale?  How about a 15? It's large compared to most companies, but small compared to most galaxies. Who knows?  Who wants to be playing a giant game of 'guess what was Timmy thinking when he said ""Microsoft?"" ?Unbelievable that adults are reviewing this well.  I suspect it's because the designer of this made the Mind, and so there was hype behind it? Or maybe there is less shame in society now, so adults feel like it's okay to indulge the latest trend even though it's an elementary-school-level toy. Decrypto or Codenames are far better party games for large groups. Just One is also recommended.

Fun Game
","

  The item arrived on time and was firmly packaged. All the pieces were included and nothing was bent, scratched or torn. It also comes with a black plastic tray to hold the money as well. The instructional booklet was easy to follow and the board is firm; however, it folds in four so it doesn't lay completely flat. Pennsylvania Railroad will stick up a bit and it's a hard crease on the B & O Railroad. I wouldn't advice being crafty by using super glue, because then it won't fold properly making the board even worse. It has to fold where the creases are, unless you plan on having it remain flat. This isn't the original version of Monopoly, I knew that based on the price, but the goal for me was to have family fun time. There were a few new tokens, T-Rex, the ducky, and the penguin which are fine when you're playing with children. For those adults who played the original monopoly and were used to being the horse, iron or shoe, theses tokens are NOT included.If you're looking for the tradition of the game, this is not for the version for you. (remember, the original board folded in two, this one does not) In addition, the Chance and Community Chest cards are also different in style, and the money is slightly smaller. But all in all, it is a fun game for the family. Although my family and I have played this game a few times, for many hours, and enjoyed it, I gave it four stars because of the fold and creases on the railroads and the inability to lay completely flat without assistance. But overall it serves its purpose.

It's nice but the way the board folds is not the best
","

  When unfolding the board some parts of it are slightly in the air because they don't have enough weight to lay flat and heavy on the table, which creates a situation that it constantly shakes up and down when throwing dice on it, which then moves the houses and cards and anything else on the board. the board definitely needs to be much heavier and fold length wise and not the way it is right now, the way you fold and pack everything is also strange, more thought needs to be put in that.I had an old monopoly in 1990, and that was much better built than this.

Absolutely not worthy of ""Classic"" title
","

  Reasons why this is not ""Classic"": Board folds into quarters rather than half, board doesn't lay flat, dice are smaller, property cards are smaller like chance size cards, art and text on the cards is different, Mediterranean and Baltic Ave are brown instead of purple, money is referenced in ""M"" rather than ""$"", GO is written in black rather than red, Hasbro logo on board, Chance and Community Chest cards are different card stock/color/font. These are just the quickly noticed differences I found after opening box for first time. I'll update if more non classic details are found during gameplay.

  Ok... before buying this product I read and saw the reviews and what was concerning was the torn board most complained about. When I got my game today the first thing I did... once I saw that one half was in two ( like the reviews) I tried reenforcing it with tape only to realize that the ‚Äútear‚Äù was intentional as it can‚Äôt fold otherwise into the square shape it needs to in order to fit in the box. I wish someone had mentioned that so I would not have almost ruined my board trying to fix what didn‚Äôt need fixing in the first place. The price on this was amazing as it was half of what I was seeing it for online. No missing pieces and it was just as fun as I remember it being as a child.

A cheaply done edition
","

  I was disappointed. This version doesn't include the speed dice, which is very helpful in keeping the game from running too long. But instead of stating that, I guess the company felt that the term ""classic"" is supposed to tell us. How petty! Why not include the speed dice and let people decide if they wish to use it? The houses are tinier than in other sets, and made from a slippery type of plastic, so it's a bit annoying to try to pick them up. They could have provided a much better way to arrange money and deed cards. In short, cheaply and badly done.

They have gotten very cheap, not enough pieces.
","

  Love this classic game, but they cut corners and it shows. I actually bought this as a second game for parts. The money isn't enough to even start the game with 4 players or the bank will almost be out. Also there is not enough houses or hotels to cover the whole board. You only get enough hotels for half the board so when everyone wants to build you can't. They should at least give you enough pieces to play the game. Also the chance and community chest cards are so few you have to reshuffle constantly to play a full game. They cut costs too much to where you constantly feel the lack of components in every manner. I would have bought an older version if it had all the parts. Instead of buying an extra stack of money and houses it was cheaper to just buy two sets.

A classic game, with only two bad points
","

  If you're here you know about Monopoly. There are two issues with this version. One, a community chest card that says to throw the cheap paper money in the air and have everyone grab for it... not only will this extend the game by dumping money in once or twice a game, this will also ruin the money very quickly. I removed this card from the set as soon as possible. The second thing is the money tray doesn't allow the money to be seated if the box is closed, so money and cards end up everywhere in the box. get some ziplock lunch bags for money and property cards and you'll be right as rain.

Enjoy playing it, but pieces were small and paper money is thin.
","

  This is the first monoply game in our family and we really expected it to be classic. At the time when I made the purchase I didn't realize there's UK and US version. But we were happy with the US version we got, as we've been to the states for quite a few times and the name of the streets became familiar to us.The game is very fun, both my 9 years and 12 years old kids outperformed me all the time. We've really spent some good quality family time playing together.The player pieces seemed tailored to our family, I like duck, my younger one likes penguin, my older one likes car, and my husband likes ship. So we have no fight on it.But we do feel that the player piece, the green house, the red hotel and the dice are made too small in size, it's not that comfortable to pick them up, especially my husband who has bigger hands. Also, if the seller could provide a small box to keep those small pieces safe, then we would be more satisfied. After 2 months playing, one dice, 2 player pieces and a few houses were missing and couldn't be found anywhere.For what we can tell, another stuff could be improved is the quality of the money. The paper was very thin, we kind of worried that the money could not last long.It's a good game anyway, no regrets.

  It serves its purpose but its not like the old monopoly game. The property deed cards are the same size as the chance and community chest cards and ate very thin. The money is paper thin and you get less of the lower digit bill's and more of the 500 bills. The board folds in 4 instead of half and luxury tax is 100 instead of 75.00 the pieces are cheaply made metal and the dice and houses are smaller. If you are looking for the traditional monopoly game this is not it. You would be better of going for the nostalgia version.

Similar to the original, not exactly the same

  Monopoly is, by far, my favorite board game out there. I saw this on sale during Christmas and was hoping to get the original game as I usually play it. Most features about the game are the same (play style, rules, etc) except for a few minor changes that are not my favorite. One of the good changes includes a new set of characters to play with. However, there are a few chance cards and treasure chest cards which give players an extremely unfair competitive advantage (catch as many $100 monopoly dollars as you can). Besides that, the game is the same as usual and I recommend it.

Severely disappointed in this game
","

  Severely disappointed in this game. I was expecting the childhood classic of swirled glass stones, even lowering my standards, solid colored glass stones would have sufficed. I ordered this as a Christmas Gift meaning it wasn't opened until the day after Christmas. When to my surprise, upon seeing the gift opened for the first time, neatly packaged inside were not game pieces... No... instead of game pieces there are what appear to be ""make it yourself necklace beads;"" which are plastic pieces. They are not even the classic colors displayed in the image, but an array of Barbie colors that would make for a lovely Barbie necklace!There were however two extra Barbie necklace pieces... Thanks for that! To make matters worse the pieces are so light that they stick to your hands. They do not pack the same punch as the heavy pieces that go where they are meant to. Instead they fall all over the place.For anyone who has never played this game they may find the equipment to be playable and fine, for the game itself is AMAZING- hence why it was purchased, but again please note that description is INACCURATE!The box however (NOT PICTURED IN FULL) says in small print ""Plastic Beads.""Let us falsely advertise in the description, not provide actual product images, and sell a classic game that will disappoint all but those who do not know what they are ordering.The game board itself is Okay... But oh well!Please see pictures provided... No a Barbie necklace is not included. I do however provide a picture of the ""bead"" sticking to my hand- no magician here!

  The box represents marble-like gem game pieces.  What I received were plastic beads with holes on either end.  They appear to be beads that should be strung together.

My board was assembled with the fold running between the Kings and Queens
","

  Buying an inexpensive chess set can be a little frustrating these days. I am currently without a decent set and thought I would pick this one up to see if I liked working with this size board and pieces.The pieces are ok, and for the price of the set (I paid $9.99) I will keep the set. The board on the other hand, I don't like. For one thing, mine seems to have been assembled incorrectly with the playing surface glued onto the cardboard 90 degrees off from what it should have been. This means the fold of the board will be between the Kings and the Queens as opposed to dividing the board between the opposing players. The other annoying thing about the board is that it has the brand-name ""Pressman"" printed prominently on the playing surface, which I find distracting. This is not how the board is depicted on the cover of the box.It's usable and not worth returning for the money that I spent on it, but on balance I wish I had not bought it.

  The checkers pieces we had when I was growing up was plastic, just like this set, but this set is super cheap.  The pieces are almost completely weightless, meaning when we tried to teach our 5 year old how to play checkers, the pieces moved constantly.  I swear, they're so cheap if feels like if you sigh too hard they might move out of place.  Do not recommend.  Learn from my mistake -- spend a little more to get the real game.

  Quality control, quality assurance are still important.  Purchased this set for my Grandson, only to have him open it and find two brown queens instead of a brown king and queen.  Error is most obvious since the White King has the small cross on his crown.  Call it what you want, but this kind of lack of attention to detail is simply unforgivable in my opinion.  Don't bother to contact me, I will do no further business with this seller.

  We love this game! My sister and I have played it for years. It‚Äôs so easy to learn and so much fun when you just have two people that are looking for something to do. I figured it was time to try to teach my kids (daughter, 9; son, 6) how to play. They caught on very easily and it is a ton of fun, but this particular game is very cheaply made. It has two wooden dowels on either side that hold the two boards together, but aren‚Äôt really attached to anything and fall out easily, so then your boards don‚Äôt stay together while you‚Äôre playing. The wood isn‚Äôt really sanded or finished, so it‚Äôs just raw, scratchy wood. I would look elsewhere for a sturdier game that finished and will last for a long time.

  My 11 year old loves this game. I have never played it so I bought it for her for Christmas in hopes she would teach me. We have played it many times. This is a fun game of strategy. Easy to learn and pick up on, where the more you play the better you get. The game pieces are lightweight and colorful and the set comes with an extra wooden slab incase one breaks or goes missing. If you like games where you have to think that won't take hours to play I highly suggest you pick up one of these. It's also great to take places, long car rides or to the beach or playground.

  I don't really know what to say about this product.  It is cheap.  I guess that is why it is under five dollars.  I honestly don't even know if it is worth the five dollars I spent on it.

Very basic and inexpensively made.

  My purpose for purchasing this game was to teach my 7-year-old grandbaby how to play checkers. I didn't want to get an expensive board game if she didn't like the game. This was just ""okay"". The board is very thin and flimsy. When we slide our checkers across the fold line, they always catch on the fold and want to flip right off the board. It looks like the board could easily rip in half. The checkers seem like they are made from thin, cheap plastic. When I first received this in the mail, the checkers were making so much noise inside the box, it sounded like broken glass. ( no, none were broken).  As it turns out, my grandbaby is quite good at this game and enjoys it. I appreciate her strategy moves and can see her analyzing each possible move. No poker face there. Not yet anyway. I probably would not recommend this checker board game to anyone looking to impress someone. It doesn't look like it will last very long. But it has given us some enjoyable hours together that doesn't involve TV or other electronics. Would I buy this particular set again?....no. Next time, I will look for a more durable set.

  Both chessmen pieces are brown with little contrast. One is a rich chocolate-y brown and the other a darker tan. And ivory and medium brown would have looked better. The pieces are fatter than the pther Pressmen set and seemed weighted. They feel heavy. The pieces are not hollow (that is visible) and do not have felt. The bottom is smooth flat plastic with no hole that is usually covered by the green felt.I didn't like the chubbiness of the pieces or the weird colors. While it was the most solidy built pieces and seemed weighted, Obviously no one would use this in a tournament so risk of them tipping over is unimportant to me. It would stand up to outdoor wind but I would not use a cardboard board outdoors.

  Is it as heavyweight as the boards those of us in our thirties, forties and beyond had as kids...No. But I don't find the set to be as cheesy as a number of reviewers complained. One reviewer mentioned that the checker pieces were so lightweight,  they were easily knocked out of place. That wasn't my experience. I handled the set and the checkers and board are definitely lighter than back in the day but not to the point of hindering play, in my opinion. My stepdad and stepsister like to compete and they had a great time with this set. I got it for under 8 bucks and I am satisfied. I love reading Amazon reviews but this was one instance where I wish I hadn't.  I struggled with the decision to purchase based on the negative reviews. Not because of the price. I was worried about the quality. I had planned to host a large dinner party for Thanksgiving and we wanted to play some classic games like Uno, Checkers, Rummy, and Pitty Pat after dinner.  I didn't want a flimsy board that wouldn't lay flat and featherweight checker peices to offer my guests. I ended up schlepping to multiple Walmarts in my area in search of a standard black and red set -- which none of them had. Had to be black and red (for nostalgia) and Walmart in my area only had the black and tan wood sets, the glass sets, or the magnetic travel set with the tiny board. Could have saved myself the hassle and just ordered this.

  I had few other Bingo cages and games, a very effective tool to play with the kids on a rainy day when a bunch of them gather together and not sure what to do other than run around in the house or play minecraft.This is the first Bingo Cage I found to be much better than the rest.1. Each of the numbers fit inside a small slot and come out elegantly. All the previous versions, if you were not careful, then two or three pieces will come out. This is a big winner.2. The pieces are not simple balls but a design with a small neck and the head. This neck snaps nicely on the Bingo board, so you can see which one is populated which are not. In my previous bingo cages, you hope u never shake it. Here a small shake will not topple all the coins out of the bingo board.3. The yellow glassy markers ensures that the cards can be kept clean AND REUSED.4. The cage has a separate slot to put all the coins.Not a deal breaker but certainly nice feature.SUMMARY: On  a simple toy like Bingo, It is commendable as to the number of improvements it has got over other products available in Walmart. IF you want Bingo for a small party or home use, this is it. Another game for a rainy day every family should have is¬†

  simple enough for kids to learn, but challenging enough for adults to enjoy. board and jewels are high quality. I do wish there was a leather strap, hinge or something to hold the board closed which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5. gave it as a gift and it was well received

Not a winner...
","

  This product is terrible. I bought it because it WASN""T the cheapest bingo set out there, thinking it would be decent. NOT the case.  The bingo pieces are not balls, which I guess isn't that big a deal, except you have to break all 75 pieces apart-- just to find out the don't really work with the cage.  The metal part that deposits the 'balls' into the shaft is too long (or something wrong) and it constantly kicks out the ones that are already in the chamber-- all over the place.  I tried many things to see if I could remedy the problem, but its just a huge design flaw. I was sad and so were all the residents who look forward to bingo each week.  Since I threw out our 15 year old set, that would've still been better, I have to use this.  I ended up putting the pieces into a Ziplock bag and pulling them out that way.  Now I am seeing that only after about 6 weeks, the paint is coming off the letter/numbers!!!!  Very disappointed. :(

Poorly made.
","

  I received a board that was either poorly made &/or made out of the wrong type of wood.  The first thing I noticed was droplet marks in the finish.  Then I noticed that there were several very rough spots in about a third of the pits where you have to get the stones out of.  It looks like those spots were never even sanded or polished or whatever they do to make the pits.  I tried smoothing them myself, but the spots act like they're a different kind of wood altogether, even turning very dark.  To top it all off one of the glass stones has a third of it broken off!  I was going to give this as a gift, but can't now.  Save your money or buy a different brand.

  I like this Mancala set-- it came with all the pieces and has a wooden base. What I wish was different (and I would even pay an extra $3-$5 for this) is the quality of the stones. They look like cheap plastic/glass combination. But not a deal breaker-- that's just the look you get for a game under $10. Now the game works perfectly and my sister loves to play it.

  This seems to hold my teenagers' attention quite well. The handling of the dice is a foreign concept to them, and Alexa doesn't know who 'did it,' so they have to work for their answers. Finding pencils for everyone was a struggle, but the junk drawer never disappoints. They asked if there was 'an app for this'--which, i'm sure there is, but i lied and told them 'no.' Has been played several times since Christmas, and since we're all at the same table, there has been less text communication. 5 out of 5 stars.

  Classic Clue game, it's a fun way to spend time with the kids and they learn deductive reasoning / process of elimination. I wouldn't recommend for kids younger than 8, though, because it can be hard for them to follow the clues and understand that if a card is seen, then they can be sure it wasn't  ""it"" and it can get frustrating.

What were they thinking?

  When i heard my 7 year grandson had learned to play Stratego in summer camp, I knew just what to get for his birthday being a longtime Stratego fan myself. I was shocked to discover there is now a version with press-on stickers, and relieved you could still buy the ""original"" with the numbers and heads of the troops molded into the plastic.But wait. For some incomprehensible reason they have reversed the numbering so the General is now 10 instead of 1, the 9 is now a 2, and the Spy is a 1 instead of an S. For someone who has played probably a hundred games with the old numbering, it's near impossible to adjust.The other ""improvement"" is a folding barrier they now include which you can put up in the center of the board to hide your pieces as you are placing them. But guess what. If you are playing with a kid, inevitably they will knock this over and send your pieces flying just after you've spent 10 minutes organizing them.I would very much like to meet the person responsible for these changes so I could give them a piece of my mind. Maybe even challenge them to a game of Stratego--the REAL original version.

  Heavy plastic pieces with the numbers printed on.  No stickers. Nice round castle (rook) shaped pieces that don't knock over easily.  Comes with covered & numbered holders for each player's pieces and a really nice heavy privacy screen for set up.

Classic game as good as remembered
","

  As one of the games of my childhood, I wanted to bring the joy of this game to my children.My first impressions were great.  The box has a great vinyl like feel that is sure to be more rugged than most of our household games.  Many of our games have cracked or broken edges based on stacking them or just the nature of young kids.  So this was a huge plus immediately.The red and blue pieces have their own carrying case.  Just a small plastic tray with a top, but it means that the game goes back together the same way each time.  And this will prevent the playing pieces from going missing.  Another plus in my mind.The board itself is rather rugged.  There was a small tear initially upon first opening, but that was in the seam of the board and not on the playing surface.  The board is heavy and feels like it will last.The divider was my first negative mark.  3 or 4 times in the first few play throughs, the board has fallen down and knocked over our pieces.  I say set this aside and avoid the potential upset.Finally, the game itself is fun.  This is more strategy then luck.  Very simple concept, but the customization of arranging your pieces is a nice change from many other board games out there.  And the time spend creating the game play is just enough to not get boring.Overall, if you played this as a kid, or this is your first time, I would highly recommend it!

Pieces have no color - numbers hard to read (too small) and they fall over and roll easily
","

  I finally got used to the new pieces being numbered backwards. The white color on the pieces make it hard to easily and quickly tell what your pieces are. Number 6 for my eyes is hard to differentiate from the 8. Pieces fall over easily and roll - knocking out other pieces like a bowling ball. I was going to return but my son adores the game - he is 7 and is really good - wow. Might pick up another version down the line - miss the other pieces stickers or not. If my son attempts to use another classic board - good luck everything will be backwards. Amazon reviews used to carry heavy weight in my purchasing decisions, they continue going down the drain for reliability and sellers padding /  bios. 2 stars. Try to find a different version if you played this game in the 70's or 80s.

  I'm so happy they decided to make the pieces look less like a corny cheep wannabe board game. I grew up playing a much nicer version of the stratego game and lost the game due to moving around a lot. Wanted to buy the game again but all the other versions looked so cheesy and cheep. This visual and quality rework of the Original Statego game does it so much justice. It is perfect, even the box feels nice :) A very high quality and well presented game. This is the best looking out of all the versions. Good job play monster.

Old School Game

  My husband had this as a kid.  I have never heard of this game!  The hubs thought it would be fun for he and our son to play.  Our son is 11 YO.  And it is!  I like it too.  It is a bit tricky on the first time, but once you have played it a few times, it is super fun.  It is a great raining day game, when 2 people have nothing to do and the 3rd one has a book to read or cooking to do!  Would be a great gift.  I would say you need to be about 9 or 10 to play this.

Strategy game, updated to No stickers
","

  Stratego is a fun strategy game.  Set up your pieces and then work your way to the other side to capture your opponents flag, but watchoit for your opponents bombs and higher ranking pieces.I have been wanting to purchase this game for years but knew the sticker version was terrible and the stickers peeled. Newer version has gone back to engraving the plastic with the piece information.

Not as cheaply made as some old favorites
","

  I've purchased several ""old favorite"" games recently, and was always disappointed with the flimsy cheap products I recieved.  This was much better.  The board was thicker and the pieces more significant.  Only time will tell if the inscriptions on the game will hold up.We have an 8 year old that we want to play more games with, and this is one that was super easy for him to learn and fun for everyone.  Best of all, it's the type of game where he will gain tactical skills over time and become more of a challenge.... currently I have to ""throw"" a number of games in order for he and I to have a fairly equal number of ""wins"".  In a couple of years, he may have to be the one to ""throw"" a game or two

Excellent strategy game with excellent customer service
","

  My wife always talked about playing Stratego as a kid so I bought this for her birthday present. We played a few games and had a blast. When friends come over, we turn it into a 2v2 and it gets pretty wild when partners try to figure out if we should wait, attack, decide where to move and what we think a piece may be. It leads to fighting but it's all in good fun.There was a small but major problem with 2 of the pieces. One of the blue piece had a scratch on it and the number 10 was a slightly darker shade of red. The red is unnoticeable unless you look really hard, in which you can immediately identify which piece is the 10. I reached out to customer service and showed them a picture. I added a filter to show how the reds differ. Within a few days, they sent two replacement pieces.

  I picked this up after hearing people talk about it. I never played it before. I really enjoy the game and so does my family. Like the name suggests, it is based on strategy. My 7 year old is able to play though. He may not understand the underlying strategy but you can see his mind working every time he plays. I like that the instructions give alternate ways to play with less pieces.The pieces are sturdy and everything fits easily in the box after use. The only negative is the middle board for blocking sight when setting up pieces is difficult to keep standing.

Game pieces have tiny numbers that are illegible.  Choose a different version.
","

  As a lover of the original Stratego, it was extremely frustrating to open this version and find out that the new pieces are inferior to the original in several respects.  1) the numbers are so tiny that it is impossible to see - especially the white on red.  The printing is very faint as well  2) The cheap round plastic rook like pieces are slippery and fall over easily during gameplay or get turned slightly so that they are exposed to the other player.I have no idea why this company ruined a perfectly good game piece to save just a few bucks.  What a shame.  This set is not worth owning.  Just to make it playable, I had had to print out numbers and then tape them on the pieces with clear tape.  What a huge pain!

  This was a HUGE step down in quality from the other villainous games/expansions. The villian pieces have almost a plastic dollar store feel to them. The villian boards are also designed so differently this time around with the villian artwork being on both sides of the play board (the other side is the special ability space) and what seems like a cheaper cardboard than what was used for printing in the past. The game play still holds up and you can tell their heart was in the right place with this one but it just missed the mark as a great rendition of an already solid game. If you're a Marvel fan this is a great game to have but as an extra addition to your Villainous collection, Just know you're getting into a very different game than the others.

  I don't really care about some of the build quality complaints you'll see in other reviews, it's fine. Maybe not as polished as the others but it doesn't effect game play.I've played twice so far. Once with Ultron vs. Hella. Ultron won pretty easily but Hela did manage to put a few points on the board. Then I played Thanos vs. Hela and Hela got absolutely stomped. We had to stop playing, I had 3/6 infinity stones and Hela was no where near accomplishing any portion of her objective. Maybe it works with more players but one on one just isn't fun.The instructions are also vague in a few cases. The worst example is Thanos' ability to attack allies in other people's realms. No where does it tell you where to put Thanos' allies. Do they go in the Hero slot? Do they go on the bottom with the other villains allies? No clue. Putting them on the top makes Thanos even more unstoppable.I'd love if the publishers read this review and somehow fixed this. I was so excited to play it.

As a collector with the Original set I'm disappointed.
","

  I very rarely leave reviews on products I purchase because I'm a bad a consumer of products, but I'll make an exception for this.Villainous is a great board game that is super easy to learn with a decent skill ceiling to offer a little for everyone. That being said, for a collector the ORIGINAL sets are very high quality and great pieces for any collection. The character pieces are cast in a clear plastic with a satisfying weight to them, the game boards are a nice thick board, and the plastic well for the game pieces are in the center is a solid color plastic center piece that looks nice. MARVEL Villainous does not hold up to this standard. The character pieces are still unique models that are nice to look at, but they are light, hollow, and do not hold up to the originals. The boards do not hold up to the original with the way they fold, and the thick/quality of the board they used for it is less than the original. The center dome is a clear plastic flimsy garbage that is disgraceful compared to the original.The only things that hold up to the original so far are the new fate ""EVENTS"" that are printed on a nice thick cardboard, and the original art that is always appreciated. I do like Villainous quite a bit, but I will say that I'm unsure if I will collect all the additional versions of the MARVEL Villainous in the same way I collected the original Disney Villainous so far due to the change in quality of pieces. As a collector it bothers me a bit more, but in terms of a fun game I'd say it's still great. If you like Marvel check it out, if you want a better looking set I'd say go for the original. Either way Villainous is one of my favorite games to play with friends because of the simplicity and how nice the set looks.EDIT: As a follow up. The game plays as good if not better than the original set. Characters feel like they ramp up in a more satisfying way and heavily interact even though things like ""condition"" cards have been removed from the decks. The single Fate deck that is drawn from is a fantastic idea that gives me ""Marvel Champions"" vibes. Thanos is one of the best designed characters, but is not new player friendly due to his seemingly infinite unique rules that aren't heavily outlined in the rule book.

  My partner and I are huge fans of the Villainous series.  I personally was stoked when they announced there was going to be a Marvel version of the game.  I will say my disappointment.....was very apparent after playing a few games.The good: the villains do have a great theme to them.  Thanos and seeking out his stones, for instance, is a blast theme wise.  It is also fun to see some of my favorite Marvel personalities come into play.The bad: Whew.  Where to start.  First and foremost, this game is NOT good in a 1v1 setting.  The fate mechanic in Disney was used a bit of a catch up mechanic, which I think is missing in Marvel.  The shared fate pool is great in theory, but the execution is lacking.  Not every villain's fate cards do much to stop other villains in the same manner.  There is the added effect of drawing fate cards on your turn that can allow you to dodge the bullets that would stop you.  It's a mess.  I would have much preferred fate cards that hit everyone just as well with a kicker if assigned to a certain villain.The rules are very inconsistent and messy as well.  There are a number of interactions (see Taskmaster and Killmonger's Rook for example).  There is a need for bolding words that are actions vs using that word in a sentence later on.  Overall, you can tell that the Covid crisis really played a part in the quality control of the rules.  Plus, it seems like it is a race to see who can turbo fate their opponents, at least in 1v1, the quickest to win.  In the games I have played or watched, that is who usually wins.I really wanted to like this game as I am THE target audience for it.  As is, I will not be buying future expansions and will only be playing the game at someone else's request.  If we have too many, I will be the first to volunteer to sit out as I do not want to participate in the head scratching of rules questions.  I wish the best of luck to this line, but as is, I cannot recommend it and will actively talk my friends out of buying it.

Same game, different feel
","

  The gameplay is fun, as always; however, there a few things that are preventing me from giving a higher rating.1. Noticeable decline in game piece quality. One thing I‚Äôve loved about the Disney Villainous series up to this point is the creative game pieces and overall high quality of the cards, artwork, boards, etc. As soon as I opened the Marvel box, I could tell something was different. The game pieces have a metallic look and are lighter, cheaper plastic. The cards are thin and stick together more than I remember with previous expansions (highly recommend getting card sleeves). Even the character booklets feel different.2. The choice to not make it compatible with the Disney line. I‚Äôm sure since many of the mechanics are the same that someone online will figure out a good way to play with both sets, but it is a bit of a bummer that the company went that route. Disney owns both properties, so it would‚Äôve been fun to have matchups like Ultron vs Ursula.3. Repeat cards. Seems like there are fewer unique cards in each deck (this could be a misunderstanding on my part). Not a huge deal as the new twist on the fate deck and the introduction of events keeps things interesting but it just adds to the overall sense that this was more rushed/cheaply produced than some of the others in the villainous series.Overall, if you are already a fan of the Villainous series (or Marvel), you will find plenty to enjoy in this release. The above is mostly nitpicks because I am a big fan of the series, overall. As with previous installments, there are new ideas in play that keep things fresh and engaging. I do like how players are no longer isolated in their own boards and the twist on the fate deck is a great addition.

  I am a huge fan of Villainous; however, this game misses the mark.The components are cheaply made and are a significant downgrade from the original and subsequent expansions.It is also hugely disappointing that the game is not compatible with the previous releases. I would have loved to have Hela go head to head with Hades, or see Ultron versus Ursula, but alas, the world will never know. They also needlessly changed certain terminology, symbology, and mechanics that does not add to the gameplay or theme.It ultimately feels like a cash grab from Disney. Take a successful game, slap a popular IP on it, and make it incompatible with the others (so people are forced to pay for essentially the same game twice).That said, this game is still fun and adds new features that take Villainous to the next level.But the downgraded components, needless terminology and mechanic changes, and incompatibility with other Villainous games take a 5-star game down to 3-stars.

It may not be the easiest game to learn but if you have any interest in strategy games you'll learn this perfectly.Definitely worth buying if you're a marvel fan and into asymmetric games.

Disappointed, Ravensburger didn't take time to test and correct typos before release
","

  Disappointed with the game. I loved Disney Villainous and have all the expansions and assumed that the Marvel Villainous would also be of the same quality, but I was quite disappointed.Firstly, the quality of the components are a big step down compared to the disney version. The player tokens feel light and made of cheap plastic compared to Disney. See pictures.The cardboard token vault is also cheap.As for the cards themselves, the creators didn't proof read them before sending them out. There are quite a few misprints and visual errors. For example there is a Random 0 cost symbol on the power stone that should not be there. There is also a typo on Thanos‚Äô ‚ÄúTaste of cosmic power‚Äù card. See pictures. There are 2 that are considered items and the third is considered an effect. Which one should it be? The texts reads more like an effect. But 2/3 are items???As for the rule book. Many of the rules are vague and left to interpretation. For example Killmonger‚Äôs ‚Äúexplosives‚Äù card. When and How do you ‚Äúremove‚Äù. Why not just say discard?As for the balance of the game, the creators should have play tested more. It is way too easy to win with Taskmaster and Hela. There should be a way to destroy or limit the power of the ‚ÄúTraining Dummy‚Äù or it gets too easy.Won with Taskmaster vs Ultron 3 times in around 15 minutes per game. Hela vs Ultron was competitive but also easy for Hela.All in all, I was excited about the game but feel that Ravensburger were too quick to release it and didn‚Äôt take the time needed to perfect the game as they did with Disney.

  I feel like having owned, played and loved all the prior Disney Villainous games/expansions I was excited to have another to add to our game collection. The quality on this product sucked. Not only are their errors on some of the cards but the plastic character tokens looked and feel like cheap substitutes.The playing decks are made out of a paper cardboard that sticks and virtually makes the cards impossible to shuffle.We made a lot of ‚Äòinterpretations‚Äô while playing Disney Villainous but usually could enjoy it. This Marvel version probably could have used a few more play tests before they released it.Personally I would not recommend people purchasing this at full price. The quality is miles lower than the predecessors.

DOESN‚ÄôT work with other Villainous games!
","

  As a fan of the original Disney Villainous games, we were quite excited to try out the latest installment in the series .... only to find out this isn‚Äôt IN the series ...Marvel Villainous May share some mechanics with Disney Villainous - but it is a completely separate game that can‚Äôt be played with the other Villainous games ... something that should have been made very clear both on the packaging and web pages - but was ‚Äúconveniently‚Äù left off.This game also adds levels of complexity to the Villainous games that make it, in our opinion, a lot less fun.  Part of what we loved about DV was that while each villain played a little different, the overall game was relatively easy to pick up - you didn‚Äôt have to spend a long time explaining things to new players.  MV is a lot more complex - and while some may see that as a positive, I do not.  If you‚Äôre playing with first time players, it will be very difficult to jump into the advanced rules.Finally, this game is a LOT more PvP than the DV games ... DV was mostly PvE with a small amount of PvP thrown in ... it meant players never really felt targeted even by fate actions, as they were playing against their unique win conditions.  MV is designed to put players against each other to achieve their win condition ... making this a far different experience than DV.Finally, the rules themselves are incredibly complex, and not well explained - lacking even a FAQ and expanded guide on the website.In the end it‚Äôs not a BAD game - the elements are there.  But it‚Äôs not the game we thought we were getting - not only in the lack of compatibility, but in the very play style.  Perhaps a different name should have been chosen.

  This game is very similar to, but NOT an expansion of, the Disney Villainous game. The villain pieces are hard plastic instead of soft plastic and a few game mechanics are changed, but my ""uninitiated"" (board game noobs) friends like this one substantially more than the Disney Version.

Unnecessarily confusing, but generally enjoyable addition to Villainous line for experienced players
","

  Overall, I‚Äôm happy that I purchased this game, but it will not be pulled out as often as the Disney versions are in my house. I don‚Äôt have any issues with the quality of the game like prior reviewers, with one exception - the common fate deck cards are just slightly thicker than the individual villain fate decks which makes them difficult to shuffle. My concerns are primarily with the game play. To give context, my sister and I are both avid Disney Villainous fans and have played all of the expansions more times than we can count  - it‚Äôs one of our favorite games. I‚Äôm writing this review after playing every possible character combination in a 2 player game at the easy and medium levels. Here are my thoughts:1. Instructions are not clear for several game mechanics, but particularly for Ultron. There‚Äôs no guidance on how to meet his objectives and it is not intuitive. We finally figured it out by watching a play through on Ravensburgers YouTube channel and searching forums. We had to do that WAY too many times when first playing the characters. We probably would have been fairly confused and given up if we hadn‚Äôt been so well versed in Disney Villainous.2. There‚Äôs no real ‚Äúmatch‚Äù for Thanos. Whoever plays him will likely win. The closest we‚Äôve gotten to defeating him was during a three hour match between him and Taskmaster - and he still won.3. One game between two people took THREE HOURS!!! Granted, it was a bit of an anomaly in our experience, but this wasn‚Äôt even at the hardest level. At points, I just wanted to be defeated so we could finally end the game. We have not yet worked up the stamina for the ‚Äúundying‚Äù level...and may never do so.4. On the plus side, we LOVE the concept of the common fate deck and events. Unfortunately, way too often, fate is not in our favor and we pull cards not intended for the person being fated. This makes it possible for luck to heavily influence the game - much more so than in the Disney versions.5. The objectives of each character have varying levels of interest. My sister and I both agreed on this ranking of how fun each character was to play: 1. Thanos, 2. Hela, 3. Taskmaster, 4. Kilmonger, 5. Ultron. We felt there was some ‚Äúmagic‚Äù missing in some of these initial characters, particularly Kilmonger and Ultron.Final note: as I said above, we don‚Äôt regret purchasing the game - it does add some unique elements to the Villainous premise that we really enjoyed. However, we would only recommend to experienced players who have already played Disney Villainous due to the vagueness of the rules. We would also recommend, to even out the characters, that the least experienced person plays Thanos. I feel like there is a lot of potential in this version of the game, and I hope Ravensburger takes player feedback into account in any additional expansions.P.S. We desperately want a Harry Potter Villainous, though we recognize the challenges in doing so with only a few options for ‚Äúvillains‚Äù. We have ideas on how to do so! :)

Fantastic Game

  I‚Äôm in love with the Villainous Games, and the Marvel edition is no exception. Contained in its own universe, rather than an expansion, this one comes with features unique to the Marvel universe. They have even made different ways, or levels, for many different ways to play. This is a game that gets different every time you play it, and varies with the amount of people playing. A bonus thing is that it doesn‚Äôt get boring when only two people are playing. Love this game!

Cheaply made and arrived damaged

  As an owner or every version of the Villianous series, I was very excited to add this to my collection.The box arrived, we excitedly opened it only to find one of the pieces already broken. It can be repaired with some glue, but its still a shame.This product is advertised as ""High Quality"" but this is considerably lacking compared to its counterparts. The plastic is very thin and flimsy and will probably all be broken very soon. A complete 180 from the previous versions where the pieces feel solid with a comfortable and reassuring weight to them.Not what I expected for the price point or from the developers. I was definitely disappointed in the overall quality.

This being most notable in the movers. The material that is built with feels very cheap and instead of being inspired by what represents the character, It directly portrays the character. It does not hinder the gameplay but it feels disappointing compared to the Disney version.I have only played the game once 1v1. It felt very unbalanced but it was nice nonetheless.

  This game is functionally incomplete, there are massive holes in the rules and gameplay that effectively require the owner to write some new rules to make the game functional and prevent certain characters from being OP. On top of the character pieces, I would compare them to a McDonald's Kids Meal toy. Poor quality with relatively little creativity to their abstract design. Unlike the character pieces from Disney villainous which are quite nice and heavy duty. It feels like this game was rushed out just to make money.

  I didn't purchase this item on Amazon, but I am reviewing the game itself. I already own all four packs of the Disney Villainous, the original and the 3 expansion packs. So, when I heard Marvel Villainous was being released, I was so excited! When it was released on Sunday, July 26th, I headed over to Target and purchased mine! I played this with my boyfriend and we had so much fun! I love that it's the same concept like the Disney versions, but has it's own twist, extra cards and different tokens! I'm really impressed. You can give allies to other players. For example, (a little spoiler alert) Thanos's infinity stones are actually given to other players and you have to get them back. In order to get it back, you have to move one of your allies to their realm. Everyone shares one fate deck which makes the game more challenging and interesting! This is a great game. If you haven't already purchased yours, I say DO IT!! You won't regret it. And then, if you don't already own the Disney versions, go get those too!I've seen other reviews, stating that these were cheaply made vs the Disney version. But, I don't believe so. The characters are made out of so much stronger plastic vs the Disney version. So, I'm not sure where everyone is complaining about that?The only funny complaint I had was that when I first opened mine, the Thanos and Hela characters were swapped from their prospective character slot. Otherwise, everything was in mint condition!Ravensburger, you amaze me! I cannot wait for a Marvel Villainous expansion pack (already) and another Disney Villainous. My favorite Disney Villainous expansion pack is the Cruella De Vil (Perfectly Wretched) due it's different completion objectives.Ravensburger, if you see this, please include villains from Tarzan, Mulan, Moana and Beauty and the Beast!

Great game--instructions lacking
","

  As a fan of the Disney Villainous games, I was disappointed in the component weight for this game. But the pieces are still stylish and look great, even if they're lighter and feel cheaper than in the prior installments in the series. But after that initial shock (if you're familiar with the Disney games), I got over it very quickly. They look and work great.The gameplay itself is more complex than the Villainous games. There's more interaction between players and player boards, and the Thanos character in particular has a lot of new rules and challenges. This is a more strategic game than the prior installments. One small but significant rule change going to the Marvel game is how the Fate action is resolved. Instead of targeting an opponent and drawing from their personal Fate deck to impede their progress, players draw one Fate card from a shared deck and choose an opponent to play it against. This sounds simple, but it adds a lot to the game. The Event cards add another layer to the game, by creating an impediment to all players at once, influencing players to devote resources to resolving those cards. Arguably, this is a better game than the Disney Villainous series.More than the components, the biggest failing of this release is the rule book. I'm not an inexperienced gamer, but I had to go back to the rule book a lot during our first few games. And then I had to go to Boardgamegeek.com to find answers to questions unaddressed by the rule book. Representatives of Ravensburger, to their credit, have been active online responding to questions and feedback about the game. I was able to find answers to every question...eventually. But there are some important rules--especially regarding the complicated Thanos villain and the infinity stones--that are not addressed in the rules and really should have been.All in all, I rate this game high. It's a lot of fun, the art is fantastic, and the theme appeals to a lot of non-core gamers, which is part of the strength of the Disney Villainous series. The strategic additions to the game scratch that itch for people like me that like a deeper game, without making it too complicated for more casual players.

Good game but needs more thorough explanation on certain cards
","

  Bought this last week and was so excited. Played twice last night and some aspects are great, but my biggest complaint is the vagueness of some of the cards. I had to Google a lot.Some examples, Taskmaster has a card allowing the movement of an ally to another players realm, but it did not say where to put it, or could I bring it back as an ally move. Taskmaster has a goal to get four allies to a strength of 5, and on each location on his board. When you move it to the other person's realm, it gets a +1 strength, so naturally I want to bring it back after, but had no idea if I could. We also Googled several things with Hela and Ultron. We played Hela vs Ultron (Ultron won) then Hela vs Taskmaster (Hela won), but Taskmaster would have won in one more turn.Some events aren't worth bothering with. Helicarrier prevents anyone from drawing more then three cards at a time (because that happens a lot). We both just ignored it.Overall I like the game, but the rules are too vague. The events and single fate pile of are a cool touch. Wish you could play it against Disney Villainous, because my daughter loves the Disney edition.

  Being a massive Marvel fan, and already owning the rest of this game and all expansions, we knew we just had to have this game. It seems that they charged more, for a subpar game. The game itself is fun, but the quality is horrible. The pieces do NOT look like they do on the ads on the website or even here, they have a cheap ""just bought this from the dollar general"" type feeling. If you see the picture provided, our infinity stone cards even stuck together, and while carefully removing them, as you can see three of the cards are SERIOUSLY damaged, one of which even had the cardboard falling off of the picture.I do hope this is a one off, and that future sets wont be made in such a cheap way or i might have to stop dumping money into this experience.

  This is a solid Villainous game. If you like the original versions, you'll most likely enjoy this one as well.  With that being said, this version is a bit disappointing compared to the original.  There is a very recognizable drop in quality in this set.  The sturdy, translucent acrylic molds of the original tokens have been replaced with cheap, lightweight plastic with rough mold seams and dull colors.  The game boards are noticeably thinner and flimsy, and the coin bank feels like the lid to an ICEE cup. Gameplay is solid, but i feel like the added  changes to separate it from the Disney versions were unnecessary, and compatibility with Disney versions would have been a better option.Overall i would say that while i am a bit disappointed and underwhelmed, i don't regret buying the game.

  I regretted clicking the purchase button once I found all of the negative reviews regarding the quality deterioration of this game, but I decided to take a chance anyway. I opened the box with baited breath to find that my components look... great! The chips feel hefty, the gem stickers are all present and have a lovely iridescence to them, and the cards feel nice and slick. I don't know if I happened to luck out and get an older game from before they reduced the quality, or if the company has gone back to using nicer components, but I am glad I took the chance! Three clues to look for if you decide to chance it as well: (1) my box says 'Space Cowboys' on the bottom side, not on the front cover like the product image shows. (2) Inside, there is a promotional pamphlet that says 'Space Cowboys 2017', and (3) the rulebook says it was produced in France. I hope others have success in getting a good quality version as well!

Favorite Game in our Rotation!

  We were introduced to Splendor by a board game obsessed friend of the family.  We enjoyed playing it with him so much that we ordered our own copy.  I'd say our board gaming preferences are somewhat refined, because thanks to this friend we've played a LOT of games, and Splendor has been one of our favorites for a long time.My husband and I will get Splendor out for a best 2 out of 3 on a Sunday afternoon.  We'll break it out to play with our two kids for family game night. (The kids request it more than we do.  They are 12 and 8.)  When we took it to play with extended family over the holidays, my sister ended up buying a copy for her family too.  My competitive and strategic brother-in-law can enjoy plotting and trying to spy out what everyone else is doing, while my fun-loving, chatty sister-in-law can also enjoy the same game and still have a chance to win.Replayability is high with 2, 3 or 4 players.  The pieces are nice quality and ours aren't showing much wear despite it being the most popular game in our rotation for a couple of years.  Our friend took it with him overseas on an extended business trip.  It's fairly compact if you take everything out of the box and put it in a baggy.  Another thing I like about it is no one has ever ended up with hard feelings at the end, which happens sometimes with some of our other games where players are making verbal agreements or even working as a team.You can put as much or as little thought into each turn as you want, but in the end you are choosing between 3 actions:  buying a card, reserving a card, or taking chips.  This makes it easy for a new player to get the hang of it.Last, I'll add that it's extremely well balanced.  It's a numbers game where your choices in the early turns have a noticeable effect on your later game.  None of the cards are over-powered, I've seen lots of different strategies earn the win.

Love this game from the beginning
","

  Was looking for a bunch of new games to add to family game night.  I had always seen this game ranked highly so bought it as part of a bunch of games.  Confess, I didn't read the directions but watch a bunch of Youtube videos to get started.  Very engaging game to play.  My wife and I love it from the beginning and play it with kids 9 and 10 years old who both easily grasp it and unfortunately beat the pants off the parents.  My wife has won once and I have been shut out over the course of maybe 10+ games.  It's a credit to the game that I still like it even though I haven't won yet.  My youngest has won quite a few times so strange that with all my life experience I still can't muster a win, maybe it's better to be young and just keep strategy simple.  Very pleased with the game, quality, easy of learning.  The one thing that was a little clunky was the first few games everyone was hoarding jewels which makes the game very slow but later on we realized that that was not the right strategy and there many other ways to move the game forward.Game quickly shooting to the top of the family favorites.

Low Quality Materials
","

  This particular Splendor game has far lower quality materials than the previous Splendor I got from 3 years ago. I'm not sure if whether the game maker has decided to reduce costs or if the seller is sourcing from a .The chip tiles are much lighter. The actual box is made with flimsier cardboard. The cards are less flexible and feel like worse quality. The game itself is playable, but it feels like such a downgrade from our previous Splendor game. I wish I had bought it in a store.I would have returned it if I didn't buy it for a game night with company.

  This is such a fun game! I love it. I highly recommend buying dragon shields for the cards though, we had a couple that looked like they wanted to split. The quality isnt the same as my friends game, her chips are heavier and sturdier than the ones that come in this set. Its still fully functional, but ours is just less. We have a couple of chips with stickers that arent centered as well. We do enjoy the game but just wished we had the same quality as the one our friend has.

I have bought two copis of this fantastic, very accessible game that requires a dynamic strategy
","

  Fantastic game! This game is very accessible and easy to learn. We have introduced this game to about five or six other couples (at least half enjoyed the game so much that they also now own it). Typically, after a brief explanation, we play through the game once. By the second play through, new players are comfortable and able to try out their own strategies. The play time is fairly quick which is another benefit and allows more than one play in a game night. This speeds up the learning curve greatly.However simply the game is to learn, there are plenty of strategies to play with and interesting dynamics that force players to make adjustments to their plans. For example, the available economic resources are adjusted depending on the number of players, this means that if someone is hoarding a resource, diamonds for example, other players will not be able to get any more diamonds and may have to purchase cards other than cards that cost diamonds. Conversely, by hoarding those diamonds, the hoarder may slow his/her own progress in the game. The level of thought that comes into this game is often evidenced by near silence in the room; players are so engaged in their efforts that they forget to talk. Our groups, who are typically quite chatty, will often get laughs at how intense each person is.My final thought is a slight disappointment with the change in components. I have purchased two copies of the game. The first one had really heavy coins that felt good in your hands and spoke of quality to the user. The new version has lighter coins but perhaps more vibrant cards. A balance of the two copies would be preferred.

Great play value
","

  This is a fantastic game:-The rules aren't too hard to learn.-It has great play value.  I've played a rather embarrassing number of games, and it's still great fun.-It's as good with two people as it is with three or four (though the strategy differs somewhat).-Setup and cleanup are quick and easy.-You can play with forward-looking strategy and complex long-term plans or just sort of do whatever looks best at the moment, and though the latter won't win you as many games, it's still fun.-Luck is involved, but skill is more important, so the better players generally (but not always) win.  I think that's a mark of a good game.  And...the play structure is such that you can make the better players play to higher points, thus evening the field.  Though the rules don't suggest it, try having everyone play to 21 points sometimes.  It changes your strategy.-And though this isn't my most important concern...it's visually a very pretty game.LOVE IT!

Cheap materials, same cost

  This built quality isn't the same. I bought it because I played this at my friend's place and the material quality was so nice. The chips feel so good in your hand, like professional poker chips.But this is noticingly difference. The chip feels plasticity and the card doesn't have nice finish like my friend's does. This thing is not something worth $20+ anymore, it's going back for sure.

Wish I would've ""let the Wookie win"" occasionally to keep it in rotation.
","

  At first, I wanted to give this 5-stars, because it was such a great hit at first, and I still do enjoy playing it. It's definitely a 5-star game *IF* you have a group of people with roughly equal strategy-gaming skills.Sadly, that does not describe my family. Over time, Splendor's depth of strategy turned out to be its Achilles' heel. My family grew tired of losing to me, and preferred other games with a better chance of them winning. Make no mistake, this game is not nearly as ""random"" or ""casual"" as it appears, and if you do master the strategies, you'll consistently dominate those who haven't. Just don't overpower the same ""casual"" people for too long, or it'll fall out of favor.Ticket to Ride and Dice Forge have both had more staying power for us in the 30-60 minute ""casual"" game category. However, despite the layer of dust currently sitting on my copy, it was totally worth the experience in the meantime.

My families new favorite game!
","

  My husband and I love to play this game. My 6 and 9 year old love to play this game. We all get excited to play this game. It is easy enough to learn for kids after watching adults play 2-3 rounds. My daughter loves that she can actually beat her parents in something. We love that the game constantly changes and uses strategy and thinking a few steps ahead- very good thing for our kids to learn. I like that my entire family can play it, where as most games we all can play are- franking boring for adults- and winning relies on the luck of the roll or card draw.This game was a hit at our family gathering (especially the 7-16 year old's) and all the pieces are big enough that they don't get lost and cleanup was easy. We had the tiny kids on teams with the adults. My siblings said they would probably purchase it as well since their kids liked it enough to play it for several hours.The specific version I received had tiles and firm cards with thick cardboard people cards.We love this game...in fact I think I am going to go play it with my kids now.

Nice game for the family and for casual gatherings--as long as there are no more than four!
","

  I first played this at a gaming convention and was struck by the ease of learning as well as the relatively fast play.  I then gifted my niece with this game, and we played it with family members with varying degrees of patience and gaming experience.While a couple of people struggled initially, by the end of the session, everyone felt comfortable with both rules and basic strategy.  The first game with 4 people lasted for about an hour.  The second game was a huge hit and lasted closer to 45 minutes, since players no longer had to think hard about the rules.There's a strategy involved, but it's not terribly deep.  With that in mind, it's an excellent board game for a wide range of casual gamers and is an excellent addition to a family game night.The only drawback is that the game is limited to 4 players.  No expansion exists that can bring the numbers up to 6, which is why I knocked off a star.

Once someone starts winning, kiss your chances goodbye
","

  While this game isn't terrible, I found that it to be just okay fun. Like Settlers of Catan, when someone gets on a good streak it is hard (but not as hard as Catan) for you to catch up. If you start falling behind, you can kiss your chances of winning behind. Still a good value for 30min of play. Not for two players, you need three or more in order for it to be fun. It would be a good ""filler"" game but not necessarily something that stands on its own.

  It doesn't take long to get the hang of it and it's really quite fun. Enough going on at a good pace that one stays engaged for the whole game. There is some strategy/prediction involved (which I like) but the randomization of the decks keeps player opportunities pretty balanced (for those who don't like strategy games). I think it tends to wrap up a little too quickly in the later stages (in being so focused on larger purchases, one might not realize that they won), but a game I quite enjoy playing several rounds in one sitting.

A great opener to a board game night
","

  This is a solid board game that is simple to learn and usually fun to play.  There are only three different actions you can take on your turn (similar to Ticket to Ride) and as a result, game play proceeds fairly quickly once everyone is accustomed to it.However, if you're looking for something deeply strategic, you may not find it here.  In my experience there are two main ways to win: rushing the high point cards to end the game as soon as possible, or holding out slightly longer to establish an economy base for yourself with zero-point cards, attempting to overtake those using the first strategy at the last second before they can end the game.  As a result I would say this is a good way to start off a board game night, but won't hold a candle to something like Puerto Rico.The copy I received had a pretty banged up box, as if it had been dropped on the floor and suffered water damage.  All other components were in fine condition.

Great game for a small group of people 10+
","

  This game has a really good balance of elements making it easy to learn for anyone (10 and up I'd say), but still requiring strategy. It has a small element of chance when it comes to what cards are put out, which is enough to throw off a strategy, but usually not enough to completely change who is in the lead. From what I saw, it seems that strategy would need to change game to game based on the initial cards put out, so it has high replay value. It's also a fairly quick game assuming you dont have any players that take five years to make a decision. I would rate this only slightly more difficult than something like ticket to ride.

Better Than Catan - Won't Ruin Friendships
","

  This game is one of my favorite board games right now. After a single game, most people will feel comfortable making decisions. After two games, most will start developing different strategies for success. Be prepared for a slow first game filled with uncertainty. After watching other players, or just playing with other inexperienced players, you'll start to get a handle on the many strategies available to win.Catan ruins friendships because trading and the robber can stifle the leading player as long as all other players collude to stop them. In this game, you can sabotage other players, but often at your expense.Experienced players can complete a game in 20-25 minutes. Inexperienced players might take 35 minutes or even a little more for the first game. What seems like a slow, lumbering start quickly accelerates to the finish.Overall, a very satisfying and mentally engaging game.

  This game is a favorite in my family. My kids (ages 16, 14, 11) rank it as their favorite, and my wife has it in her top 3. It's quick to play, easy to learn, and balances well strategy/engine building/luck. The cards are good quality, and the chips are fantastic quality (so much fun to play with if you're fidgety like me!). The rules are easy enough to understand from the rule book, but we found learning this game was easier watching a quick video online. Once one of us understood how it worked, teaching it to others has been easy. It's one they pull out for friends or family anytime games are mentioned. While only for 4 players (unless you follow some readily-available-online-5-player-variants), it works great with 2 or 3 as well. The game definitely shifts some dynamics based on how many are playing, which enhances its replayability factor. For kids or adults, or any combination of both, this is a must-have if you like board games!

  I have a ton of games in my collection...60 or 70 I'd say.  Always play them with my wife.  We tend to like games that are fun for both of us but not confrontational enough that someone feels bad when they lose.

It's quick, fun, economic, has a little bit of interaction, and the build quality is excellent.  If I could only keep a handful of my games this would definitely be one of them.The only issue I have is that it's really easy to get enough points to end the game and you don't realize it.  You just play along and then both of you count your points and realize the game was over a long time ago.Other games that have a similar feel: Targi, Jaipur, Ticket To Ride Nordic, maybe Rivals for Catan.

BORING - the rules are unclear & incomplete

  We are a smart family who enjoys games of strategy. This game fails on every level, with the exception of the illustrations (nice work, Pascal) and the high quality of the materials. Clearly the rules were lost in translation, what the what? There are multiple gaps in the rules in addition to a total lack of clarity in the instructions (we had to read the rules several times then made up rules to account for the gaps and to make the game progress forward). We have nearly a hundred games and this is the first & only game that we unanimously say 'BORING.' It takes a long time to accumulate enough gem tokens to buy prestige points so the game really drags.

Loads of tense fun despite weak theme
","

  I could see what he was saving up for.  He was three points from victory and I had four to go.  I needed another turn after this one to get the last ruby I needed for my collection I knew a noble wanted to see.  Her patronage would give me the points I needed to win.  But if I didn't block my opponent, he'd win.  How close are the others?  The next guy is probably in the same boat I'm in.  Then I can't... maybe the guy I block will block the other guy.  ""If I can't have her no man shall""  I remembered the scene from LadyHawke before the wicked bishop of Aquila got his.  Hmmm...  Which am I?  the bishop or the former captain of the guard?  What am I thinking?  I'm a Jeweler! trying to make my way in the world.This is the only trouble with this often tense game.  You can see what people are planning, you are hatching plans of your own, but don't think much at all about the theme of the game.GAME PLAYYou start by picking up three different colored substantive poker chips- with pictured of various colored jewels.  or you can take two of the same color, if there's enough remaining after you take them.  Then you use these to pay the price for a card.  A card may cost two blues and a red and a green or four whites.  I mean they may cost rubies, diamonds, emeralds, etc. Each card you buy has a picture of a stone in the top right corner that acts like a poker chip of that color to be used in conjunction with the chips in the future.  Except that cards don't get returned to the supply.  Some cards also have point values associated with them.  There are three tiers of cards.  Good, better and best ones.  The best always have points.  Better often do, but have less.  The good ones seldom have a single point.  Whoever makes 15 or more points first triggers the game end.  Anyone needing last ups gets their... last ups and the final score is tallied.There are certain nobles laid out that look for certain card combinations.  The first to have three blues, three whites, and three reds cards gets to claim the noble.  So you are racing for those too.  One can win by ignoring the nobles and holding out for point scoring cards, so there is a little bit in the way of multiple paths to victory.One other thing you can do on your turn is take a wild stone and pull one of the cards from the supply that only you can buy later in the game.  This is usually used to stick it to another player.  Taking what they had finally saved up for.  However, it could be used to get the last red that you need but can't have since all the red poker chips are in the hands of other players.The trouble with sticking it to someone is that it takes your turn to do it.  While one guy did that to me to help his fiancee win the game, it was very tender, yes, but his game suffered for it.  I may have done some heavy trash talking and deserved to be ganged up on, but I digress.  And yes, I realize relationships are important, and we even buy crazy expensive jewels to show just how important they are to us...THEMEWhich brings us back to Splendor.  The first tier of cards features in repetitive, but beautiful, artwork for where the raw stone featured in the top right is originally harvested from.  The second tier of cards shows the people who prepare the stones.  The third tier is where they might be brought to market.But cards from every tier act the same, as far as game play is concerned.  Maybe the game could be re-themed as an automobile making game and the high tiered cards would require specific components made from lower tiers...  All that to say the theme feels weak to me.BALANCEIt does feel balanced at the very beginning.  Whoever goes first gets the first shot at buying the cheap cards, but after two rounds, everyone is into the groove and facing the same challenges of having the cards they want purchased by everyone else.DOWNTIMEYou've got to wait your turn, and people can pause to reflect on what they should do because someone just took the card they want.INTERACTIONNot much required by this game.  The resources to buy with and to be bought are fairly limited, so more tension is at the beginning.  The stakes get higher as the game progressesFOR MYSELFI love how easy it is to teach others.  I bought if after being blocked from winning, and others have bought it after I taught it to them.  There's lots to love, just not the theme.  My four year old loves to play this game with her older siblings.  It's a winner.

High replay value - friends can't get enough
","

  My friends simply can not get enough of this game.  I was first introduced to it in Australia & after months of being away decided to purchase it on Amazon.  The price definitely seems to fluctuate on it, so keep an eye out.Essentially you're a gem lord building an empire of mining facilities.  You pay gems to purchase these mining facilities.  Each mining facility then counts as a one-discount of that type of gem each time you purchase something in the future.  As you build up your infastructure (or engine), you can purchase more expensive cards & points. First to 15 points wins!Each turn you can do one of three things:1) take gems from the bank. Three different types (1 ruby, 1 emerald, 1 sapphire for example) or 2 of the same (2 sapphires or 2 rubies) Note: there must be 2 gems remaining in the pile if you do the 2 of a kind option. Ex. there are 4 sapphires in the bank so you could take 2 sapphires. Ex2. there are 3 emeralds in the bank, you cannot take 2 emeralds because this would leave less than 2 remaining in the bank.2) purchase a card (mining facility) by paying the cost at the bottom of the card3) reserve a face-up card on the board. You take it and can purchase it on a later turn instead of taking your regular turn. You also take a gold gem which is used as a ""wildcard"" gem in lieu of any gem requirement.Watch your opponents & predict what they'll do!Ease of learning: takes me 5-10min to explain the gameGameplay: quick.  People take turns rather quicklySkill: both novices and experts can play.  The game is highly dependent on what the other players do in the game.  The 2-player version involves the most ""skill"" as it's mono-e-monoBuild quality:  high. Smooth, nicely weighted gem tokens & colorful, easy-to-understand cards

From a 2-player perspective
","

  The game is simple, collect enough points to win. The strategy is ever evolving, collect what you need, while obstructing your opponent from gathering what they need.Since purchasing Splendor, my wife requests to play it most nights.  It's easy to set up and 2-player games can be had in 20 minutes or so.  We play it often enough that we have yet to put it with the other games, it just remains on the table day after day.  I'm not saying you will get that much play out of it, but finding a game that plays well as at 2-player can be tricky sometimes.Game play is simple, you do one of the following actions: take gem tokens (2 of the same color if 2 will also remain, or 3 of any 3 different colors), purchase a card, reserve a card and take a gold token (wild), or pay for a card previously reserved.  The general idea is to purchase enough lower level cards (they have color coded gems on them too) to be able to purchase upper level cards later on.  When purchasing, you give the bank back all token chips you use, but not the cards you use to make the purchase.  So if you end up with one of each 5 types (Onyx, Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire) and another card comes up that requires one token of each color, you have the ability to pay nothing for the card and place it in your pile.Reserving a card is what I really enjoy about the game.  If you are just one token shy of building the card you want or you think your opponent may want (or really need) a specific card, you can reserve it.  Take the card, place it face down and take a gold token.  On a later turn, when you have satisfied the cost of the card, you can pay the price and place that card in your inventory. The reservation of a card is limited to three (3) cards in reserve at any given time.  This can be a useful strategy when trying to thwart your opponent because they may build the card they need to achieve a ""Noble"" card.Noble cards are placed at the top of the card draw area.  The number of nobles is always the number of players plus one.  Each noble is worth 3 points.  So for a 2 player game, 9 points is sitting up there for the taking.  Each noble has a requirement that must be satisfied before it can be won.  These goals are in the number and type of specific cards you have acquired (such as 3-ruby cards, 3-onyx cards, and 3-diamond cards).  If your opponent is only 1 card away from a noble and you are trying to achieve the same one, you can reserve the card they need, and on your next turn try and build the card you need to win it.Overall, we typically play 3 rounds before my eyes hurt from studying the requirements of all the cards and my brain refuses to take any more (a little more than an hour).  At that point, I call it quits (until the next night).We have owned the game for 11 days now and have played it on 9 nights. I've got to find another 2-player game before we burn ourselves out.

  This is probably my go-to game whenever I want to introduce new players to the engine-builder style of game mechanic. There's a lot to like about this game.For starters, the components are of good quality. The tokens have a hefty feel to them, akin to weighted poker chips. The cards and artwork are decent. And the game itself is fairly straightforward. It's as easy to teach as it is to learn.This is often compared to Machi Koro and Century Spice Road. While they have similar game mechanics I feel they are each unique enough to justify owning all 3. But of the 3 Splendor is usually the first I introduce to new gamers.Overall, I'd rate it 5/5.

  A must-have game for any gamer's collection.  This game is almost always the very first game we pull out when introducing games to a new gamer.  Why?  It's simple to explain and uses familiar concepts of set collection.  The cards are neutral enough in theme that it's not going to put off anyone who prefers traditional card games.It also has quick set-up and plays pretty fast with 2-3 players.  This makes it a game we also pull out when we have time for just one more short game before bedtime or when we want to squeeze in a lighter game in a more hectic day.

  We really like this game. We tried the basic Splendor first and that became very popular in our family, then we added the Splendor Cities add-on package to heighten the complexity a little bit. If you can count and play cards you can play this game. Most of it is strategy and counting, no dice throwing (so none to get lost), the only chance is the order in which the cards turn up for each player to access on their turn. One game with 4 players takes about an hour and fifteen minutes although more can play. Strategy can include blocking other players' strategies. It was so popular we bought a set for our beach house too.

  We were introduced to this game over spring break 2016.  We took a trip with a couple other families and rented a cabin near the Smoky Mountains.  Between the 3 families we probably had over 30 games along.  We LOVE playing strategy games.  However this game quickly became the game of the week.  I think only a couple of the other games were opened up over the whole week.  When we got home I ordered this for our family and bought the app for my phone.  My 3 kids ages 8-13 enjoy this game as much as me.  I don't feel like I need to dumb-it down at all for them.  There's enough of a challenge to each game that makes you want to play it again and again.  With experienced players a round can be played in about 30 minutes.  It's a 2-4 person game.  I sort of wish you could play with more people but it would definitely add a different challenge as well as lengthen the game time.  Maybe a future expansion?  I love that you can play with 2 people and it doesn't seem to change your game strategy at all.  It's not one of those games that you say ""but it's more fun with more players.""  Having played the app quite a bit I can even see how one could come up with some solitaire options if they didn't have someone to play with.

  While reading through the directions nearly scared off my early teen, it was actually refreshingly easy to pick up yet engaging enough that it's been played frequently since.  While recent reviews questioning the quality gave me pause, the game we received (early 2020) seems very solid.  There's definite opportunity for strategy and some impact of luck.  It's been fun for 2-4 players, with a bit different dynamic resulting from each.  I'd highly recommend it!

If you‚Äôre sick of monopoly, and your kid is a tycoon-try this :)
","

  This game is so fun! I wanted something that my 12.5 year old son and I could play that WASN‚ÄôT monopoly, for the nights when he has no tv and he‚Äôs driving me crazy. I would suggest playing a test game of two hands by yourself (that‚Äôs what I did) before you try and teach your kids because it took ME much longer to get the hang of it, than it did him. I was easily able to correct his play this way, without referring to the directions and slowing down the game.  There aren‚Äôt SO many rules that it‚Äôs hard, just that reading them once isn‚Äôt enough.  But once you play a few rounds and check yourself with the rules, you‚Äôve got it :)We finished a 2 person game in about 40 minutes. He immediately wanted to play again.I thought it was dang fun playing by myself too.It‚Äôs a win!

Sometimes Simple Is The Way To Go
","

  This is a seriously light game.  I cannot explain it, but I really love it.  Splendor is the most simplified version of an engine building game out there.  In the beginning, you can't afford anything.  While playing, you get more powerful and use the gems you bought to but more powerful gems.  There are some strategies that will win over others almost every time, but there is enough luck left in the game that any new player could potentially beat a seasoned player.  Anyway, not only is it fun, but it is fast.  If you know what you are doing, it can finish in less than 30 minutes, and very often, we decide to play again right away.  Now, this belongs in the ""Play with the family"" category.  I would not bring this with me to a board game night with my friends.  You might, and your friends might thank you for it, but for us, this game is a waaaay far on the simple side to spend game night on.Also, there is another game called Century: Spice Road which I think is a bit more fun and feels a lot like this game.  They are different enough to have both in your collection.

A fun Gateway game
","

  This is another good little Gateway game that will play in less than 45 minutes game with four players. It's good at all player counts and does what it's supposed to do. Thematically it's hopeless. You're gem dealers doing what gem dealers do and that's the end of the theme. I think that's the one sadly lacking component of the game and that you're doing stuff to be doing stuff to get points but it really doesn't matter what stuff you're doing to get stuff if you know what I mean. Aside from that quibble gameplay is simple and streamlined in that you can only take one of three actions on your turn and that really speeds things along. You may get stomped here and there until you adjust to the flow of the cards but once you do you should be roughly competitive in most of your games

  This is a great game! I've so many good things to say about it.The pieces are sturdy and well crafted. The weight of the gem pieces make you feel like you're actually holding something of worth, which makes the game even more enjoyable.The instructions are simple. New players pick it up quickly, and there's a minimum of dickering about the rules.The game uses a great mix of luck and skill, so a complete newbie has a fair chance of doing well against a seasoned pro.There are lots of viable strategies to win, so the gameplay doesn't get stale.

Nice quality, simple game!
","

  Splendor is a pretty simple resource based game. You can teach all the rules in about 5-10 minutes, and a round of play only takes 15-20 minutes. Also, the materials are very nice quality, and well packaged. The cards are a smooth, and nicely laminated, and the coins have the weight and evenness of real poker chips. Everything fits nice into the box. For more serious board gamers, I wouldn't recommend it, as there isn't a ton of replay value, since it's fundamentally the same game each round, but generally speaking, it's a fun, strategic game that doesn't require too much time commitment.

A Great Game!
","

  Splendor is one of the best games I've been introduced to in the last couple years.  It can play as slow or as fast as the players want, offers challenges for various skill levels, and is otherwise just plain enjoyable!  Other reviews have covered that well enough, so I'll just leave it with two little add-ons: I think that despite the age recommendation of 10+, a clever six-to-eight year old could handle the game well enough (or with a little help), and our games run closer to 45 minutes to an hour--but Dad and I are pretty competitive and like to really analyze our moves.My parents, who are in their 70s and for whom I originally purchased the game, weren't originally enthused about learning it.  After we got a few games in, though, they found that they enjoyed Splendor enough that they had me order another for them to give as a gift.  We now play Splendor a couple times a week whenever they are in town and they're now teaching my nephews how to play!I do have one minor complaint about the game though.  My parents have some vision issues, and it's sometimes difficult for them to distinguish between the colors on the cards from where they sit around the table.  The gem requirement graphics shown on the cards are oriented in different ways and do have different shapes, so that helps.  We keep the play area down by them, but sometimes they still have to ask about the requirements for a card or noble.All that being said, after Space Cowboys (the original publisher) was purchased by Asmodee there have been some quality issues (or at least changes).  The copy my parents ordered was SO MUCH LIGHTER than their copy that my father weighed it and compared it against theirs.  He then insisted on opening it beforehand to make sure everything was actually in the box (it was).  But the gemstone chips were only about 2/3 the weight of the other set.  That was only copy (1 out of 6) that was like that, but it at least partially lines up with what others have said.  Both those boxes were the same ""Golden Geek"" marked boxes,however, so that's not a guarantee of the quality of the components.  My most recent purchase all appear to be older stock, so those boxes are still out there.

Fun, addicting game that's easy to learn! Just needs an expansion pack!
","

  We tried out this game at Christmas with family and were hooked! We just had to buy it so we could better our skills and go back next Christmas and beat everyone. ;) I'm one who doesn't love learning new games if there are complicated directions, so I was a little concerned by this at first when the person explaining it took awhile and it sounded confusing. But once I started playing it, I got the hang of it right away. Our 8, 10 and 12 year old kids even love to play it. I only wish they made an expansion pack so our family of five can play together. We have figured out how to do it on our own though by adding a few red, black, white and blue poker chips to the stash. The only color of chips we don't have is green, so that has become the ""hot commodity"" and actually gives the game another challenge because the green runs out quicker, making you have to switch up your strategy. We have played this game with a few other couples since buying it and they have all loved it too. Once you play the first time, you want to play again - it's addicting.

  Just a quick note to say the component quality is great. Chip weight is good (maybe not to the first printing standards, I don't know, but these are not cheap flimsy plastic, they feel good) and chip color is consistent/perfect.

THE QUIETEST PARTY GAME EVER
","

  This is a nearly perfect board game. The components are high quality thick poker chips and the cards have impressive artwork. The rules are only two pages and the game can be explained to anyone in less than ten minutes. I have introduced this game to all different kinds of people and it is fast becoming a Saturday night staple. It has just the right mixture of length and complexity. The amazing thing is what happens to everyone around the table once the game gets going: All conversations come to a halt. Everyone stares intently at the cards plotting their next move. We have all played this game several times and everyone agrees that there is no one real strategy. A tactic that worked in one game will fail in the next game. This is a credit to the designer. The only real strategy is to get your ""engine building"" effect going as fast as possible and race everybody else to the end. Another nice benefit is the fact that this game plays as well with 2 players as it does with 3 or 4. But since nobody talks during this game, it doesn't really matter!

  If you're looking for a game to get someone into board gaming, look no further. You can teach it in minutes and it has this highly addictive quality. On its face, it's a simple card game of matching colors, but throw in the competition for currency and it becomes completely engrossing.

  We bought this one as a gift but also own it ourselves. Splendor is one of our favorite games. It is easily played by 2-4 players. The game suggests 10 but our daughter was able to play around 1st grade. I'd say it depends on the child.We like that the game is different every time you play it, depending on the cards the come up and the way each person plays. Some people like to go for a lot of cards, some people focus on the point cards, some people on the nobles. It is easy to learn/quick to teach and can be played anywhere with a space of approx. 2 square feet. Fun for both board game aficionados as well as 'newbies'.

Fun game for 2!
","

  We were looking for a game that would be fun for 2 people and wouldn't be too repetitive/get boring quickly. Splendor fits the bill, and every game is different due to the order of the cards and the royal cards selected. Note that for 2, we noticed that the game is more fun if you take out 5 cards per color in the brown deck (lowest deck with the most cards). Otherwise, you can finish a game without really needing many cards from the green/blue decks, and it makes it less interesting/strategic. Make sure you buy from a reputable seller (select your seller instead of using the default)... we received a game that was in perfect condition and had the sturdy, plastic poker-style chips!

  There's something addictive about collecting precious gems. This game is all about building the best card engine. The competition for gem cards is intense, so you'll find yourself taking cards even when you can't afford them, just to keep them from your opponent, especially when he needs it. Play balance shows that this game was well thought out and tested. What I like about this game is that there are so many different ways to win. Works great for any number of players 2 to 4. Quality components, especially the heavy gem chips.

Easy to learn, but a fun amount of strategy
","

  Splendor is a fairly quick game to learn, as you really only need to understand the options you have for taking chips and buying cards before you can get right into it. The strategy is pretty clear for anyone who has played an engine building game before, but anyone who isn't as experienced with board games will pick it up after one playthrough.The game itself has a good amount of strategy for how simple it is, as the order of cards and the different nobles changes each time. Over the course of the game you'll need to adapt to what your opponents are doing and which cards are coming up, changing your strategy based on the available options. There is also a mechanic that allows you to reserve one of the cards on the table, which is a great boost to the competitive element - though it sucks when someone takes the card you've been building to off the table!Splendor is a fun, fast-paced game that is pretty quick to pick up despite having a decent amount of strategy. It might not carry a board game night on its own, but it stays in the rotation for me as a short warm-up game or a cool-down after a bigger one.

There is voodoo with an explanation of different voodoo dolls, seances, the gateway to hell, pentagrams, demons.... It goes beyond fun scary things into really, really dark things.

  I'm going to be that person. Everyone at the party is like ""Oh my god, I love Betrayal!"" and I would literally rather be sucked into the walls of pulsating slime than play this game another time. Nonetheless, I have played this game dozens (or what feels like hundreds) of times and I know a thing or two about it.1) Are you someone who enjoys long, drawn out, complicated, convoluted, games of mild strategy/mostly luck? You have no where else you need to be for the next 4 hours? Really?? Sad. If so, this game is for you, proceed to the next step.2) Be sure to look up the revised rules, as the current rule book has tons of inaccuracies and some of the haunts make absolutely no sense.3) Read everything multiple times. Got a number in your head? No, more than that. EVEN. MORE. Good. Now you'll still be confused but at least you'll be confused with the correct information.4) Consider wearing costumes. It really livens things up.5) Play on a large surface. The house will grow in every imaginable direction, there will be cards and dead bodies everywhere. It's a mess, make sure you have the space for it.

Great Game, Poor Quality
","

  I would like to start by saying that Betrayal is one of my all time favorite games. If I'm rating this based on the overall gameplay, I would give it a 4/5 stars. Only 4 stars because, as many other reviewers have mentioned, there are many haunts that are lacking details that can make the gameplay rather confusing.My main issue related to this game is the quality of the game and pieces. All of the small monster/item/etc token pieces require you to punch out the pieces from a large sheet. A large portion of my pieces ripped and tore when punching them out. Additionally, a room tile and character card have some small tears on them. The characters are all made of cheap plastic. One of them was not set properly and leans so much it barely stands up. I have some friends that own an older version of the game and it is of much higher quality than the game I received. I should also mention that the actual game box has started peeling. I have only had this game for 2 weeks now and it already looks like its been heavily played for years.I do want to mention that I reached out to Avalon Hill about the torn game pieces and they are sending me replacement pieces. The customer service was great, but the actual replacement parts are going to take 5-6 weeks to ship to me. It's rather disappointing for a new game that is rather expensive to buy. I expected higher quality. I can only hope that the replacement pieces are better than the originals that I received.Gameplay - 4/5 starsGame Quality - 1/5 starsAvg Rating - 3/5 stars

One of my favorite board game purchases of the last year. Lots of fun.
","

  Betrayal is one of my top favorite board games that I'm constantly trying to get my friends to play. It's a fun, challenging game that's really enjoyable with the right group of people.It's an exploration/board building game with an eerie theme about it and a really unique mechanic.Players begin by choosing a character -- one of 12, each of which have their own set of stats. Then players enter the house, flipping cards to uncover rooms to build out the mansion. Rooms can contain special events, items (like weapons, armor, or occult paraphernalia), or omens. Which are bad.Whenever an omen is found, the player that found it must roll the die and roll more than the number of omens that have currently been found. If a player fails to roll more than the number of omens, then THE HAUNT BEGINS. At this point, the instruction book is consulted which will tell you which haunt scenario to follow based on the conditions that caused it to occur. Usually one player is named the betrayer and is given their on set of instructions to follow (I suggest you make them leave the room) while the rest of the explorers plan their strategy to defeat them.There are around 30 different scenarios you can play out, which means that you can play several different unique stories. The flavor text of all the cards is pretty entertaining, so things are best if everyone can get into it when they're reading to the group.Overall it's a really fun game that can be enjoyed by both seasoned board gamers and beginners.

This began when the children were little and has remained a fun family tradition into the children‚Äôs 20‚Äôs.As with anything the games have evolved from CandyLand to Risk, Axis and Allies and now this.We have already played it three times and enjoy it every time.Pros: The concept is great, it‚Äôs enganging , unique board design, high variety of outcomes , the cooperative concept can change to player VS player changing the dynamic and creating quantifiable fun, it can be a long or short game depending on the variables and it covers our need to include all of our age groups for entertainment value.Cons: Being the ‚Äúmonster ‚Äú  can be confusing as the literature (instruction book) is not written for beginners, although variable scenarios are possible it can quickly become familiar leaving the surprise aspect absent, limited card selection (we are already buying the additional pack at roughly $19.00)  so this could be intentional as a way to upsell the product. (Brilliant marketing strategy)As a tool in our parental tool box to combat the digital age and losing touch with our children on a very personal level this is a great addition and will be played for many years.Other facts to know:The players build the game board as they go and this can demand a large playing area.Game cards will scratch if played on a rough surface. We play on a stone dining table and this has occurred.The ‚Äúmonster scenarios‚Äù are all different and in our expierence thus far - it appears everyone wants to be the monster.It costs less to buy this than the amount you would spend to take the whole family to one movie, you could play this for many evenings.Enjoy and ‚Äúgame on‚Äù!

Difficult to learn at first! Great Fun! Best for 4+ players! New fun every time!
","

  This game is a lot of fun, but it is hard to learn. The directions can be somewhat confusing-especially if you are new to the game. It is so much easier to have someone who knows how to play to explain it to you as you go! I'll do a quick synopsis to demonstrate:One of the difficult parts to learn was what ""The Haunt"" and ""Monster Roll"" was. The haunt is basically where the game changes.The monster roll is the turn of the monster (whatever monster is activated) during the haunt.Basically, you & your group enter a haunted house. Roll the dice to see how many rooms/steps you take. You start off with just the entryway-you ""discover"" rooms as you go. This means you grab a board piece that corresponds to whatever floor you are on and add it to the board where you are.Once you enter a room, some will have a symbol on the room & it will direct you to pick up a card & read/follow the directions on it.It's best to discover as many rooms as possible before the haunt is activated. *The haunt is activated by a dice roll.During the haunt: One person will take on an extra role of being the monster. The other players will try to defeat the monster.See? Not too hard, but unless you read the whole booklet very carefully, you might not understand fully.  It took 3 of us fumbling thru one game, then kinda knowing what we were doing during the second. Then we some-what mastered it on the 3rd round.It is ok with just 3 players, but way more fun with 4 or more!It has a great re-play ability to it. Each time things will change-rooms, monsters, items you have, etc.Overall, this is a great game. It has a learning curve in the beginning, but you can catch on quickly after that. Like I said, having at least one person to help the others walk thru it, makes it way more fun & easy to learn! It's not a quick game-if you take your time & especially if you are new, it will take at least an hour to play!We paid $31 + tax for it and it was worth it. Hopefully, they will make a new addition with easier to understand directions. I'd also like to see it take longer to activate the haunt. It is fun exploring the rooms & lots of times we only have a few before the haunt!

  My family is pretty much casual gamers- although we enjoy games like Settlers and Pandemic, we just don't seem to have the time or endurance to learn longer, more complex games. Being a big horror fan, I've been wanting to get this for years, but put it off for that reason. This year I broke down and got it, and we're been loving it. It's really not that hard, and is a lot of fun. My 11-yr-old daughter can't get enough of it, and takes the betrayal very seriously. The first part of the game is easy: Just move through the house, exploring tiles and experiences minor challenges. Then the Haunt is revealed: One of 50 Random stories. Each of these plays like a slightly different game using the same rules as the first part. It's a lot of fun, and challenging.

So much good horror fun!
","

  We've had a LOT of fun with this game. Mechanics are pretty simple: you pick a character and ""explore"" an old house, by going through doorways to reveal new rooms. You then pick a new room tile from the stack of tiles and lay it out, connecting it to the doorway you just passed through. Most rooms have either an event, an item, or an omen in them. If so, your turn ends and you collect an event or item or omen card. These cards are fun and sometimes you get benefits, sometimes bad things happen to you.Eventually, once enough omen cards have been selected, something called ""the haunt"" begins. At that point one of the players turns traitor! He or she then goes off and reads the haunt instructions from a booklet, while the remaining players read different haunt instructions from another booklet. Both players and traitor get instructions on how to win the game. This is totally cool. Sometimes your foe is a ghost, sometimes a mummy, sometimes it's the house itself seemingly come to life! The clock starts ticking then, as you have a certain number of turns to win by.Just remember one thing: the rules are there to help, not to drive you nuts. If something is unclear you can ask in many online places (including here on Amazon) but remember to keep playing even when confused about a rule. Decide what you think the rule means and go for it! If you later on find out that you didn't do the rule correctly, just play it ""right"" the next time. Or stick to your own interpretation. It's a game, and it's FUN. Enjoy!Now where did I leave my holy water...

  This is a really fun game, but very involved with LOTS of rules. We have had a few arguments on the interpretation of the rules and decided we needed to take a break from playing this game for awhile. You can't do ""XX"", but you can do this if XX type situations and gets really confused. This is a really a 2 part game. First part you all are exploring the house and having fun building and surviving the unexpected twists each room provides. Then, based on certain conditions, the haunt begins (part 2) and suddenly one of you is the bad guy (traitor)  and going after the other explorers (heroes). It is the heroes job to prevail and defeat the traitor, and the traitors job to destroy all (depending on the haunt). There are 50 haunts with different rules. Which haunt you get depends on the room in which it was triggered and the Omen card drawn. Overall, very fun game but requires a lot of mental work to learn.

Fun and Variable for Experienced Gamers, but a Little Complicated and Creepy for Beginners or Kids
","

  Let's start with THE GOOD NEWS: I'm personally a big fan of this game! It's basically like putting yourself in the middle of every horror movie you've ever seen or heard about. If you like horror movies, then you'll like this game! If not, probably give it a pass. I'm a pretty experienced board-gamer and like many aspects of its gameplay, especially the many ways in which the game is almost never the same each time you play it (see details below.) However, Betrayal is also a very detailed and complicated game that I wouldn't necessarily recommend for beginning gamers or children. Here are some highlights:GAME DESCRIPTION: As I mentioned above, the game essentially places players into the middle of every horror movie that's ever been written. The game has two phases: 1- Exploring the House, and 2- The Haunt. At first, everyone works together while you play as a band of assorted characters who are exploring your way through a haunted house, revealing haunted room after haunted room. While exploring the house, players collect artifacts that make them stronger. Eventually, however, one player stumbles across an item that triggers the second phase, The Haunt. During the Haunt, you're trying to deal with whatever monster/spirit/other horrifying problem emerges to haunt the house (there are 50 different Haunts to play in the game, depending on how exactly The Haunt is triggered). Often, the player that triggers the haunt turns on the other players (i.e., becoming a werewolf or something) and the other players need to either band together to bring them down or be destroyed. The game ends when either ""the haunter"" or ""the haunted"" complete the task assigned to them in The Haunt!VERY FUN FOR EXPERIENCED GAMERS: In my opinion the best part of Betrayal is the HUGE variability it contains. Every single aspect of the game changes from one round to another: you can choose different starting characters each time (who come equipped with different abilities [strength, speed, etc.]), the haunted house is never the same twice since you reveal rooms from a shuffled stack piece-by-piece, you discover different items each time, and the huge selection of Haunts makes it so that you almost never have to replay them (I've played this game many times, and have yet to repeat Haunts)! Also, the game is made all the more fun because of its immersive, creepy vibe. There are some Haunts that I like more than others, but the feeling of being stuck in a horror movie with your fellow players is pretty pervasive and entertaining. You'll love it!NOT FOR BEGINNER GAMERS: As fun as this game is, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to beginner gamers. The game is very complicated, and takes a close reading and re-reading of the rules to play it right. Also, it has lots of fiddly little pieces that, if lost, can really disrupt gameplay. My biggest complaint about the game is that the rules for The Haunt aren't always clear, and you kind of have to decide as a group what the ""rules of engagement are"" in situations where disagreements arise. This is exacerbated by the fact that only The Haunter is allowed to read their instructions, while The Haunted read their own. If you are a beginning player and want to give this a try, I recommend you find someone who already knows how to play and have them walk you through it. Or do a video tutorial!NOT NECESSARILY FOR CHILDREN: Finally, because of the horror-based foundation of the game, I wouldn't recommend it for children. Some of The Haunts are pretty creepy, and I wouldn't want to be responsible for recommending anything that might cause nightmares! I'd say that the game creators' recommendation of ""Ages 12+"" is appropriate.Bottom line: I'll return to play this game many, many more times in the future, and hope that you'll enjoy playing it too. Happy haunting!

Very Good for What It Is

  Do you like board games? Do you have friends and family who also like board games? Do you like roleplaying elements, but never knew how to enjoy these with those same friends and family? Then this game is a very good match for you. I do some tabletop roleplaying and things like that, and I like board games. My family are not roleplayers, but they like board games. I bought this for my dad this Christmas so that we could all play together as a family.There is a little bit of a learning curve. There are lots of different pieces and chips and all of that sort of thing. However, there's a good guide on Youtube that helps understand things a lot quicker, and with that and a quick trial game, you should be good to go.Everyone enjoyed this game. My sister does not like board games, and we got her to play it multiple times in one night. My brother and his girlfriend wanted to get their own copy to play at home. The roleplaying elements are as light or heavy as you want to make them, so it's an easy, accessible game for your more 'normie' gamers.My dad loves board games and he often has a hard time getting anyone else to play with him. That was not a problem with House on the Hill. Four games in one night, and ""a near-perfect day"" for my dad means this gets 5 stars from me.

10 Lessons learned by a First Timer
","

  I am happy to report that quality of construction issues many reviewers reported have been fixed. So that's a plus. But here are some things I learned from playing this game the first time with my family.1) the rulebook is an encyclopedia smeared with mud - metaphorically of course. But it is thick and obscure and honestly leaves you with more questions than answers.2) there are LOTS of dice but no clear indication of how many to roll.  So we decided that when it say 4+ it meant roll 4 dice.  No clue if this is right but it was just a way to move forward and stop flipping through the book.3)before the haunt - the only point is to collect cards and earn skills. That's it. So don't put too much thought into that part. Just collect cards and build skills or you will die almost immediately after the haunt.4) the Monsters- good grief could the actual directions be any less clear about this?  What we think is that different haunts use different monsters and the traitor will be given the directions as to what monster and how.  Our particular haunt had no monsters which caused us to constantly be questioning why we weren't using them and our traitor was  really frustrated because the haunt scenario didn't mention them so we had no idea.5) there is stuff in the box you may not use - they put tons of stuff in there because some haunts need x and others need y so you have x and y in the box. Don't let it confuse/frustrate you. This of course is my theory based on our one experience - which was extremely confusing and frustrating.6)when you become a master player the game may take an hour....but for the rest of us - it takes MUCH much longer. Most of which is spent reading rules and trying to interpret them.7) the item cards are things you can use when you attack or battle things later.  I have no idea about these because we fumbled our way through the haunt which seemed random so we never actually used our items and only had a couple of attacks because we really had no idea what we were doing.  We couldn't understand the nomenclature enough to strategize nor did we know what they were talking about....for example, ""add 2 if you have the madman in the library and the music book and someone has the music skill""  Um.....what madman?  What music book? Does the someone with the music skill need to be the one rolling the dice or is it any member of the team? What if two members have the skills, do we get double the points?  Turns out - some of these are cards or chits you may earn. So when you read things you don't understand - assume they are cards/chits you will eventually find.  That does of course make strategizing harder.  Some of it you just have to make house rules for. So we decided any person on team could have the skill and if more than one had it we got double the points.  Who knows if we are right but it at least ended the debate and moved us forward.8) give up trying to figure out the rules and make your own where there is conflict/confusion (which is often). You will have a better experience if you just make a decision and move on rather than spend an hour flipping through the book only to not find what you need. Trust me on this one.  Flip a coin, accept the decision and move on. Or you will all be miserable.9) there are YouTube videos.  Seriously! Watch one before attempting this game, it will really help you at least have a clue what you are doing.10) several reviewers say you need to play 3 times before deciding what you really think. I am going to trust them because I really wanted to like it but found it a quagmire of confusion and frustration. So we are going to attempt it again (after watching the YouTube video).Honestly, after the first time through I actually threw the game to name the traitor the winner because I just wanted it to be over. I boxed the game up and planned to give it to Goodwill. I logged in to write a review and instead read lots and lots of other reviews and then decided to give it another try not worrying so much about ""the rules"" and just going with the gist of the idea - which makes for a MUCH better experience.  I'll let you know how that goes.  If it fails - I am burning this stupid game.

Publisher needs to put out more detailed and clearer haunt rules
","

  I love the idea of this game. I have no issue with the material or tokens or anything other than the apparent lack of playtesting of the haunts. One minor problem is that most haunts seem to clearly favor the traitor or the heroes and it's demoralizing when it's pretty apparent very soon after the haunt is revealed which side is going to win.The bigger problem, however, is that most of the haunts are not written well. The haunt-specific rules are often unclear and ambiguous and the many resulting questions quickly bring the game to a frustrating and screeching halt, especially if the traitor is a player new to the game. I would urge the publisher to review all of the haunts, playtest them properly and publish more detailed haunt explanations online to make the game much more enjoyable.

Very dark game + demonic content + not suitable for families
","

  Our family LOVES strategy board games, and we were very excited about this purchase to play during quarantine. I read through all the rules, watched a YouTube video to help with set up, and was ready to sit down and figure out the many elements of the game we supposed would make it fun. We were enjoying the board set up and building the house, but as soon as we got to ‚Äúthe haunt‚Äù, we closed the booklets and threw the game away. The game has extremely dark content not suitable for family play and not advisable for any age. If we are going to spend four hours of our time as a family playing a game, it will not be one so demented and morally dubious.

Fun for more experienced, role-play gamers
","

  This game is definitely a longer one, and has a dark/scary feel. (Not just cute halloween, but definitely haunted house) The idea of having many different outcomes, a board that slowly unfolds, or characters that can change sides is great! but the first play is VERY long. It may be worth youtubing to learn gameplay.Especially if you end up being the traitor in the group... you essentially get an additional booklet of instructions/rules that you need to play as the bad guy, and others involved in the game can't help you too much, or you lose strategy. If you're not a more experienced board gamer, or at least ready to do lots of reading, this may be too much for you or your friends.That being said, after you learn how the game basically operates, it may become easier the next time you play?The only thing I would say is that there were sometimes we as a group really had to search through the manuals (yes there is multiple) to figure out how to do certain parts of gameplay...I.e. how many times can I actually do damage to this monster in one turn?If that could be made clearer and simpler, it would really go far.Note: I do not have the updates to the game people in the comments are talking about, like the player boards etc.

Second Edition- Fun Times!
","

  I gave the game a 5 star review because it's got it where it counts: fun factor. Here's my overall impression of the game.**Gameplay: 5 stars**We all have a blast playing the game! Just when the exploring starts to become dull, the game switches to a survival game where anything can happen. The random unpredictability keeps all of us on our toes.**Board Pieces: 4 stars**The board pieces aren't warped yet for our game, and I hope it never happens. The artwork is great and the sliding counters fit perfectly. The cards are high quality and fun.**Figurines: 2 stars**These were the biggest disappointments for me. They are very low quality and the faces look warped and inhuman. It was hard for us to distinguish a few pieces apart because of their low quality. If I had a collection of other figurines, I'd be very tempted to use them.**Instruction Manual: 3 stars**Although they did a good job trying to explain the gameplay for a quirky, random game like this, our group was left with almost as many questions as we had answers. We looked up as much as we could, even searched online, but in the end had to come up with some reasonable house rules.**Replay-ability: 5 stars**The random nature of the game means you'll be playing it a lot!As I said before, this game has got it where it counts. Even though it's not a perfect game by any means, it is so much fun I forgive it for its faults. Get it, play it a few times, enjoy it. That's what gaming is all about.

Great game, not so great figurines
","

  Let me start by saying that this is a 2/5 as opposed to a 5/5 for the pieces received and customer service received, NOT for the game itself. I highly recommend this game to any board game collector or player that wants co-op tabletop and group play.The reason I marked low on my review is because of the game figurines we received with the purchase. While the materials are acceptable I received 2 of the same figure (the little girl in yellow) and was missing the little boy figure from the game. Not unusable...then I unwrapped them and noticed 3 of the 6 pieces were horribly leaning, and while they did manage to balance upright the appearance they give is not of the highest quality. Before writing this review I contacted Wizards of the Coast hoping they could at least replace the missing figurine and I could leave a proper review and show the replacement piece...unfortunately the piece we received was not at all close to the character in the game, nor does it look like it belongs in the same set of figurines. While this game is not unplayable by any means, having pieces that match are what make a game feel complete. The service I received from Wizards of the Coast has, in the past, always been great. This time, unfortunately, I received an automated reply telling me they would send a replacement piece and then received this (image 3).I am sad to leave a less than deserved review because I have been a fan of WotC products and this is the first time I have had a real complaint with them. However, after seeing that these pieces are a recurring issue with this game I am surprised that they have not re-cast pieces, or at least ensured that the sets are properly packaged/assembled before sealing and shipping.I hope future products and purchases are of the standard I usually see from this company.

Super fun game

  Super fun game. I usually play with my D&D group, but once I pulled it out for a house party when I was trying to entertain some teenagers. Now they're the sort to fight and scream in a way that kinda ruins a game, even with other really fun tabletop games. I'm all for getting loud and having banter in a game, but not in a way that leaves half of the group feeling exhausted and thinking that they didn't have fun. Surprisingly, that didn't happen with this game. They were all engaged and enjoying themselves. If one of them got too rowdy, the others were quick to calm them down because they were all having a good time. Played it with them on other occasions, and since they understood how to play, it only went more smoothly. Like, I thought this game was fun before, but I like it more after that experience.

Tons of fun, but a giant hassle
","

  As fun as this game is (which it is a ton of fun) there are so many small tokens and pieces that you have to keep track of and no real way to organize them.  You can buy an organizer for $30, but that's something the game should come with, not something I have to pay for.  Need the smoke token?  Ok, give me 5 minutes to sort through the pile of tokens to find it.  And there are games where you'll need multiple tokens too.  I really just wish this was better organized.  Also, the character cards suck, but there are plenty of third party apps for tracking characters that make it easier to deal with.  This game is so close to being 5 stars, but it's just missing so many little basic things that it really shouldn't that I even honestly struggle to give it a 4 star.  The actual game itself is a blast and a fan favorite at game night, but it's such a cluster to deal with because the lack of organization

Amazing However Confusing at Points
","

  This is one of my favorite games to play on game night. It is a unique cooperative game, unless you become the traitor the it is a unique game where you massacre your friends and laugh at them. This game comes with 50 different scenarios and I have still yet to play them all. The first play through takes a little bit of extra time to get the basic rules down but then runs smoother after you have a game under your belt. It usually takes an hour per play through. My friends ask to play this all the time.Even though this is one of my favorites, I docked it a star because the rules can be confusing on each scenario. Some are straight forward while other scenarios are poorly written. It can take quite a while to figure out your objective whether you‚Äôre the heroes or the traitor. Even though I have played this a ton, I still play with the rules right next to me so I can figure things out. Finally, my last knock on this game is the plastic character trait tabs are too big for the cards. They don‚Äôt hold their position well so it is easy to mess up what your traits are.Overall, despite this game being confusing at points it is a rare must have if you like to play games in groups of people. I have played this with my family (including parents that don‚Äôt understand strategy games) and with my nerdy friends who play tons of strategy games. Everyone loves it.

  I have bought tons of board games, but this is the first one that the wife said the night after we played it for the first time- hey would you guys like the play the game again tonight? I was blown away. The game does have some issues, but overall it is fun and engaging. There aren't a ton of actions per turn and play seems to move quickly until you get to the haunt. Once at the haunt, the game does slow considerably as you try to figure out what the new rules for the game are.Some minor quibbles- the rules are ambiguous at times, especially during the haunt. There is help online, if needed. The suggested age is the first place where I could say that you should listen to it. Younger players could play fin up to the haunt, but once the haunt begins, that falls away. A lot of responsibility and intuition falls to the traitor to figure out their part. if they are too young or just can't get things normally, then the haunt will fall apart. One of my 12 year olds just couldn't grasp the intricacies of the haunt and we eventually just gave up that scenario.

A Great Game for People Who Love Games

  I've played Betrayal before at friends' houses, but this time I bought it for my dad, who has a huge, ever-expanding board game collection and was looking for something new and unique.This game is exciting, spooky, and incredibly suspenseful. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, as there are a lot of mechanics and possibilities and the way you play the game can change in a moment. But for friends and families who like to play board games pretty often, Betrayal is a perfect way to shake things up.I think I'd compare it to the game Mansions of Madness, except Betrayal is a lot easier to understand and faster to play.I think its best feature is that it's a really dynamic game and everything is designed so that you can play over and over again and still get a totally different experience every time. For example, you and your friends explore the titular house on the hill by placing room tiles as you encounter them, so the map will always look wildly different with each session. This base game also comes with dozens of story scenarios that are triggered randomly by play, and each scenario is adaptable so that the ""traitor"" can be a different player every time or even that there can be no traitor at all, meaning you never know who is suddenly going to turn on the rest of the group after you've just spent the first half of the game trusting (and giving weapons to--uh oh!) each other.

Simply incredible

  51 games in 1! The base game starts as everyone exploring/building the house while encountering spooky things and helpful items. Eventually the haunt will start, and then things get crazy. Someone becomes a traitor, and they leave to read their traitor rules while the good guys read their new rules. There are 50 separate haunt scenarios possible. They are chosen depending on the 'Omen' card you drew and the room you are in when the haunt starts.This game can be really short, or really long. I don't think it has ever lasted more than 3 hours for my group of 4-5. It really depends on when the haunt starts (random) and if the haunt has even sides between the good and bad people. Most of the time, one side is seriously stronger than the other. But that all depends on when the haunt starts and what people have found by then. It stays fun by being unpredictable.The instructions are a bit iffy with respect to some things... but it is fine overall. They need to work on the rulebook and make things more clear. Lastly I will say that the component quality is very good. Everything looks well made. Go ahead and grab the expansion for an added level to the house and 50 more haunts!

  I was a little worried about how my family would receive this game. But now I'm so glad I bought it! We've played it multiple times over the last few days and we still love it. Our players were aged between 15 and 50 years old.Pros: although the reading the rulebook seemed daunting, we all picked up the rules very quickly. Even during the exploring half, there was always something happening to keep us engaged. The game is made to be slightly different every time, which keeps it from getting stale. My teenage siblings were begging to play again. All the pieces are very good quality and the rules were easy to understand.Cons: VERY dark themes and a little scary. When my toddler was in the room, we didn't read our cards out loud. And when we played it at night, we had to play another goofy game before we went to bed. I wish it had a lighter tone so it would appeal to a broader age range.Overall, we really love this game and think it deserves all 5 stars.

  We love this game.  We've played it so many times, and every time is different.  There are still so many haunts that we haven't experienced yet.  the replay value of this game is outstanding.  Very fun to get spooked out with friends on game night.The rules are not too complicated, so it's easy for those who are not as familiar with these types of games to get into.  The interesting scenarios and unfolding story keeps everyone attentive.  It's probably not a good game to play in a distracting environment, such as a large party or while a movie is playing, but it's engaging enough that no one is bored.Also, download the character sheet app in iTunes and Google Play.  It works a lot better than the little black clips that slide up and down the edges of the character cards.

  There's a ""traitor"", but it's not a traitor mechanic if that makes sense. Yo spend the game walking through the house, collecting treasures, piecing together rooms, building the mansion and story setting.  Along the way, you will be gravely hurt, injured, scarred, and your stats will either go up or down.When ""it"" happens and your spooky dice hit their roll, you each disband and do your best to learn the right rules of the game. Each of you has a win condition, so you're kept secret because knowing the win condition makes it easier to stop the other team.This is where knowing some horror movie tropes comes in. You can piece a few things here and there together and try to incorporate that into a strategy, but really this game comes down mainly to whoever ""wins"" the dice roll that indicates your shift to traitoring.I'd recommend you get the baldur's gate version as well btw. This gets old and the DND setting of the other makes it more timeless.

  ¬†My brother loves board games so we decided to all play this with him for his birthday.  The first time was rough.  It takes a while to learn how to play, so we spent over an hour trying to play and figure it out our first game.  But once we learned it, it actually is simple.  We played again with my teenage nieces and they loved it.  We played twice in a row.Watch a YouTube video to learn how to play it.

  I've played this game for YEARS and it has yet to get old. Yes, it can be complicated at first and maybe a bit overwhelming, but it is very easy once you get the gist of it. Every round is different--the game comes with 50 different storylines that are initiated randomly during each round by triggering the ""Haunt"". You can also get expansions that add even more stories.Something really cool about this game is that you build the board as you go! There are room tiles which are drawn during each person's turn.My only complaint is that the items and events get repeated a lot from game to game. There just don't seem to be enough cards. That can get kind of old, but that's really the only ""repetitive"" part about it. The rest is a big surprise!I 100% would recommend this game to anyone who wants to bring excitement to their weekly gamenights.

  I really don't like scary things. So it was a stretch for me to enjoy this game.It was fun trying to get stronger and exploring the house -- even as an atmosphere of fear permeated the game... waiting for haunting to begin!When it finally did, I was the monster. And I was honestly a little scared because they made me stay by myself in the bathroom while they discussed their strategy as the humans trying to escape the house. The game will be hard for people who like clear rules and instructions since it sometimes doesn't provide it or it's buried in some obscure section of the manual. I'm someone who is flexible, who thinks it's fine as long as we stay consistent with whatever rules we decide on. Whereas another player was really annoyed because having a poorly chosen rule (even if it is inconsistent) can make the game unfair.I would like the game better if they made a non-scary version. Like this is a garden game and you are plants -- and you have to get your fertilizer, nutrients, water before the humans come to harvest you.The game play said 1 hour. It took us 3+ hours to play. Admittedly way spent 30+ minutes on it just trying to understand the rules. One player literally fell a sleep while the rules were being read out loud and started snoring.

  While it may take a second to pick up on this game, Betrayal is a must-have board game for your collection. This game never gets boring--in fact, it's full of suspense! My friends and I have enjoyed the twists and turns and are always excited to see what the next game will bring. We recently purchased the expansion to play it all over again!It can be confusing for first-time players, and I highly recommend playing with at least one person who has played before. Play time can exceed 60 minutes, especially if you're not entirely sure what you're doing and have to keep consulting the rules.The game is divided into two ""chapters"": (1) exploring/building the board which is a collaborative stage where everyone works together and (2) the ""haunt"" in which the ""good guys"" fight a common enemy (sometimes this is a player or even the game itself). This keeps the game exciting! The board is never the same twice, and you'd be hard-pressed to go through all the scenarios for the ""haunt"".

  This game quickly became one of my favorite board games after I purchased it. Each playthrough is so vastly different its a very refreshing game to add to your collection. I love the mechanics of finding out who is the traitor halfway through the game and building the map as you go. My only real critique is build quality and some haunts can end very quickly depending on character builds.Build Quality: The insert for organizing the game for storage is terrible. You will want to replace it or remove it. If you want to combine the expansion and the base into 1 box you will HAVE to replace the insert. The clips use to track the stats per character are horrible. They are way too loose and can slip when you aren't paying attention. They sell an upgrade pack to fix this but you could just use pen and paper or paperclips instead. Everything else in the box is pretty high quality. The character models aren't that great but do the job.Haunts: They're random so you can't really plan ahead but sometimes you get just the right character stats to break a haunt and it can end in a few turns. The other haunts we got were pretty fun and balanced for both the traitor and the heroes.Overall I love this game but if using a fantasy theme doesn't bother you, I highly recommend buying the Betrayal at Baldur's Gate version instead. It has slightly upgraded mechanics and the characters feel more unique. The clips feel a bit better too.

  This is one of my favorite board games!Basically, you build a mansion as you go, exploring new rooms and encountering events, items, and omens along the way. No two games are ever the same except I always seem to get the mystic elevator!At a certain point you start the haunt, which is where you will discover that one player has turned traitor, there is a hidden traitor, or there is no traitor at all, but you still need to do certain  things to win. There are 50 haunts in the base game, and 50 more in the expansion.  I have played the base game quite a few times and still haven't played all of the haunts.The rules are mostly straight forward. I recommend watching a game play video before or after you read the rules to get a better idea of how to play. Some of the haunts have things that come up that aren't clearly outlined in the rules but you and your group will most likely become able to make good judgement calls when you are used to the game.As I mentioned, there is now an official expansion for the game that adds new haunts, an additional floor, new tokens, and new cards.

One of those ""classics"" that you should own.

  This game is basically comprised of two parts. In the first, you and the other players are explorers randomly revealing room tiles as you maneuver throughout the house.Many rooms will have an Event, Item or Omen associated with it and after you reveal the tile, you take a corresponding card and read it aloud. This furthers the story along and does a great job of giving the gameplay a lot of character and depth. I always love games where thematic, bite sized stories are incorporated into it (I.e. The Crossroads cards in Dead of Winter or the story book in Above and Below).Discovering and drawing Omen cards will move a counter in a track that you'll roll against. Eventually, youll fail the roll and the second part of the game (the haunt) begins.One of the players will become the Traitor at this point. He/she will take a special Traitor book and go into another room to read what they will be trying to do from that point forward. The other players will read from a Heroes book and concoct a strategy based on the details they are given.From that point forward the Traitor works against the Heroes. It's very fun, very engaging and playing with scary sound effect/music in the background is a hit.This is basically one of those ""must have"" games if you're a board ""gamer"".It is not without its faults however. First, the components/artwork are probably the worst I've ever seen. You'll need to heat the minis in boiling water and bend them back in place as well as heat the small tracker pieces that go on your characters board and pinch them together as they WILL fall off. I laughed when we played the first time as the ""Ballroom"" tile is about as ballroom looking as an empty shed. The art is horrendous and everything feels cheap. This is a game that can benefit from a WELL MADE rerelease.Second, the instructions do a fairly good job but they don't cover all situations (no instruction booklet in any game ever does) so you WILL need to clarify some things during game via Googling or through agreements by the players.Is it a ""family"" game? It does deal with occult topics and has monsters and is intended to be ""scary"". Cards can reference pentagrams, etc. so if you're offended by that sort of thing (lighten up!) then this isn't one for you and your family.

LOVE!
","

  I was introduced to the original game about 15 years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it!  It's equal parts RPG and Board game with mystery, horror, and survival built in!  It was discontinued for a hot second, and original versions of the game could be found online or used, but the price usually exceeded $80 or more.  A few years back, the re-release came out - still a little hefty in price.  So, I waited.  FINALLY it went down to half off on my favourite shopping site and I nabbed it up.  I have such great memories of playing this game, and I love teaching it to new people.  There are a ton of little bits and pieces, and there is a slight learning curve, but once you get rolling, it guarantees hours of fun.

Great game design, a lot of replayability.
","

  Our game night group all pitched in to get this game, and it was absolutely worth it. Most fun I've had with a board game in a while. Thematically, the game is very fun, and the artwork and design elements are nice and spooky, while keeping a fun playful atmosphere. Great for a Halloween game night, obviously.This game has a lot of replayability. Since you build the house as you go, the layout of the board is going to be different each game. And the 50 different ""Haunt scenarios"" means you will have 50 outcomes, with specific rules and objectives, so you will never play the same exact game twice.If anything, I'd say due to the many variables in the game, there are a lot of cards and pieces to keep track of. Might take you a couple plays through to figure out how to use all the elements. Would also recommend it more for folks who are a little more seasoned in board games. The rules can be daunting for novice players.As far as shipping, the game arrived in one piece, pristine condition, with all its parts and pieces intact.

... At House On The Hill is one of my favorite games. It combines an immersive theme
","

  Betrayal At House On The Hill is one of my favorite games. It combines an immersive theme, exploration, hidden traitors, and a twist every game. There are six characters that you can choose from and anywhere from three to six people can play, though I'd say five to six players is where the game really shines. At the beginning of the game, all the players start out in the foyer of the unexplored house on the hill, procedurally generating the rest of the house as they go. As they move around, they explore new rooms, which can trigger events, provide items, or revealing grim omens. Every omen revealed causes the player to have to roll against an ever increasing count. Failing this roll triggers ""The Haunt."" Using the rule book, the players determine which of the 50 scenarios you'll play out for the rest of the game. Each scenario features different rules, usually pitting one player against the others. Often times the betrayer will get supernatural powers and the rest of the players will receive instructions on how they can defeat this ancient evil, supernatural force, or what have you. Once either the betrayer's or the rest of the players' victory conditions is met, the game ends and an epilogue wraps things up quite nicely.This game really captures the B-movie horror/thriller/sci-fi vibe amazingly well! I love thematic games that immerse you in the game and allow you to create your own stories and Betrayal At House On The Hill definitely gives you those tools. The art and all of the components are great and add to the feel of the game. While the combat rules can be a little clunky at times and a few of the clips used to keep track of the various stats were a little loose and wouldn't stick, there is so much about this game to love, that I have to recommend it wholeheartedly! If you like co-op games, exploration, hidden traitor mechanics, or have ever wanted to play out an episode of Scooby Doo or a B-movie, do yourself a favor and check out Betrayal At House On The Hill!

Chasing Your Friends Through a Haunted House!
","

  I have owned this game for a year and it continues to be my favorite. Who wouldn't want to become a monster and chase your friends through a haunted mansion?!This game is divided into two phases. In the first half of the game, you explore the mansion together, dividing up to explore the three floors of the mansion as you see fit. The house is treacherous and many nasty events will occur, but occasionally you will gain a helpful item or stumble upon a boon for your character. In the second half of the game, once the requirements are met, the Haunt begins. One person will become the traitor (as revealed according to the manuals for that specific Haunt), and the rest are now working to defeat him or her. There are 50 haunts that occur, so no 2 games will ever be the same. With the layout of the house constantly changing and the randomness of items and (mostly terrible) events that occur, even having the same haunt again makes the game completely different each play.A fair note - this game involves LOTS of reading. It is a favorite in my regular game group, where we don't mind a heavier game with lots of stat tracking and reading, but when we try to get casual gamers involved, they sometimes get bored. Yes, you will be stopping to read a short few sentences aloud from a card at every turn. The Haunt in itself involves the traitor and the heros team dividing up to study a page of instructions. As much as I love this game, I don't think that it's a ""fun for all"" game. Also, the scary themes can be a bit mature for the younger audience.Other than that, I will continue to play this regularly, and look forward to the expansion this fall!

  So I heard lots of great things about this game and I must say....It's freaking awesome! There are QUITE a bit of rules (about 19 pgs.), but there are lots of video on YouTube of gamers playing it as well as some tutorial videos to help you and your friends learn. You need at least 3 players. After playing our first game me and my friends are hooked! We can't wait for game night again! Definitely reasonable and since I got it at a discount it made the price a bit easier to swallow. There are 50 different scenarios that could happen so no game, for the most part, will ever be the same. I'd say this is definitely for more advanced table top game board players.

Fantastic and fun game... But has some flaws
","

  First off, let me say my friends and I love this game. Very high level of replayability, easy to learn, high level of intrigue, and loads of fun!That being said, the game does have some flaws... There are 50 possible scenarios but many are not fully thought out by the designers. Some are heavily weighted to the Betrayer and some are heavily weighted to the heroes. Some of the scenarios also don't play as well as others because there's insufficient information provided for you to form a good strategy for your side. Sure, you can come up with ""house rules"" to fill in some of these blanks, but as the Betrayer, you're a team of one so it's difficult when you have questions about some of the scenario rules and you don't really have anyone to discuss with without revealing your powers/abilities/goals.

Not the worst game, not the best either
","

  To the plus, the game is always different the next time you play which makes it somewhat interesting.  The beginning of the game is similar each time, but once you start the ""Haunt"" there are dozens of different versions with different rules.  The downside to this is that you are always reading rules, which are not always clear, and it slows the game down.  So, it is very much like the slowness of playing a game for the first time every time you play.  My daughter loves this game, but I find it rather boring.  I'm averaging and giving it 3 stars.

A hit with the whole family and has a new adventure every time
","

  This game is really fun and has loads of replay-ability. For one the house will never end up having the same layout since you draw tiles as you go. You also have six different characters to choose from each with their own stats. Also there are 50 different haunt scenarios which changes the game drastically and makes one person become a traitor.Basically it is a game for up to 6 people where you are explorers going into a haunted mansion. You get six different characters to choose from each with different stats that will drastically make a difference in the game depending on who you are and what the haunt ends up being. The initial set up takes a while since you need to punch out a bunch of cardboard pieces but at least they are high quality and made on thick cardboard. The character pieces come painted and look decent enough. The house tiles are held together by little clips which if you don't touch the tiles to much when your playing with them you shouldn't need to worry about them always coming apart. The rules are pretty easy to learn and after playing a game you should be able to explain everything to a new player easily. The first time playing will take a while to get everything right but after that its super easy and you will hardly ever need to look up something in the rule book.Back to the game. So each person moves around the house going room to room adding tiles. With each new room added to the house something good or bad can happen. You could find an item, have an event happen, or get an omen card. An example being you could find an awesome item in a room or you could end up having a spider land on your shoulder and you need to roll to see what happens. So as the game goes on occasionally when you enter a new room you will get an omen card and if you don't roll good enough the haunt starts. One person becomes the traitor and has a goal that varies with each scenario such as taking out all the explorers. The explores have their own goal which also varies with each haunt. The first to finish their goal wins and also the explorers don't know what the traitors goal is and the traitor doesn't know the explorers goal. There's even some scenarios where no one knows who the traitor is.Overall this game was very fun and fairly easy to learn. A game can end very quickly or it could take an hour. I liked the quality of the pieces and how they were on thick cardboard. Before buying this I saw that some of the older reviews said the components were bad but they must have changed them because mine were on nice thick cardboard. I also liked the amount of replay-ability since no two games will be the same. This was a hit for my whole family and it makes for a fun evening every time.

Tons of Spooky Fun!
","

  This is an excellent game. Perfect for groups up to 6. The game has a changing narrative that evolves throughout the game's run time. As an avid horror movie fan, it is extremely fulfilling to see some of my favorite horror movie tropes rear their fearsome heads in a board game. I have played this game a handful of times, and no two games have played out the same way. The board changes shape, the villain appears as a result of moves you make during the game, and the variable strengths of the different characters give it an RPG feeling.The game plays in two phases. I call the first phase the ""Buffing Phase."" During this oart of the game, it is in your best interest to find any way possible to increase your character stats in preparation for the arrival of the villain. The second phase comes after ""The Reveal."" One of your party has betrayed your group, and has led you to your potential death. Your objective becomes defeating that player, as well as the evil he/she has released.The game makes you question every decision you make, with respect to cooperating with other players. You don't want to be too close to them on the board, because you can become their first target, but at the same time, there is strength in numbers following the reveal. Who knows? You may end up being the person who has betrayed your friends.I highly recommend this game for fans of horror movies and games, or lovers of group/board games.

Great game, but really needed extra polish.

  Great little board game. My friend's and I love it. But there are some issues with the game.The overall build quality is super cheap. A vast majority of tokens for the game is just punch out cardboard, I really wish they would have been at least plastic.The mini figures are made out of a super soft plastic and as a result, a bunch of them were deformed out of a brand new, sealed box.The inside of the box isn't designed in a way to actually deal with all it's parts. There's tons of loose tokens and parts and there just isn't enough space to store and organize the parts in any useful way.If all the pieces were made out of more durable material, if the miniatures didn't come out of the box deformed and if they would have put more thought into the storage of loose parts, it'd have been a 5 star product.

Impeccable Game with Lots of Replayability
","

  My friends and I have played this game a lot over the past couple of years and have absolutely loved it. The atmosphere built by all aspects of the game is fantastic, and the variety of characters, rooms, and cards makes for a unique experience every time you play. We have absolutely loved the dynamic of the game, where parties start off neutral and later are turned against one another, and we have played through each of the game's 50 unique haunts. One of my complaints about the base game is how hard it is to escape the basement (the expansion pack negates this issue), as well as a lack of spare parts (we have lost several pieces over time, but we have made it work. The game's mechanics offer a great challenge of strategy where almost every action has its consequences. I like to think of it as a simpler form of Dungeons and Dragons where the campaign always involves a haunted house. I would give this game six stars if I could, and I would suggest it to anyone who loves strategy board games, creepy stuff, and Betrayal.

Decent game, poor components
","

  I bought this game for our family after watching it played on Tabletop.  The game play is almost entirely a game of chance.  You basically roll dice, move around revealing tiles/rooms, roll dice again, etc, hoping to get some decent items until a haunt roll is failed.  The game gets more interesting once the haunt begins, the betrayer is discovered (even to him/herself) and a short story ensues.  The haunts we've played so far have been very different from one another, so there is definitely variety here.  Unfortunately, the haunts don't seem to last very long.  It's all over rather quickly, for one side or the other.  Even so, it can be a fun light game.  My 9 year old really gets into it.My biggest gripe is component quality, specifically the character wheels.  The ones on the show were big and sturdy, the sliders attached well and stayed in place.  They looked really cool and unique and their ease of use was part of the reason I was interested in this game.  The ones in our box are large but also very thin and flimsy.  The cheap plastic clips to use as sliders DO NOT STAY ON, much less stay in place.  The slightest shift anywhere near them makes them slide around and if you pick up the wheel to look closer, most of them fall right off.  Since many events in the game require moving the sliders, and each move may or may not actually change the value of the stat, it can be a real pain to keep track.  Aesthetics aside, components need to at least function properly, especially at this price point.

  This is a great board game for only the most avid group of players. If you have friends that are not willing to putforth what can potentially be a long game (one of our games took 4 hours to finish) than you will be disappointed. It does take a while to get the mechanics of the game but once you have played through it a few rounds it flows very smooth. There is a shift/twist in every game that changes the mechanics of play slightly but keeps the game fresh and repayable. If you're an avid fan and have a good group of friends who are the same, this is a great pickup for your collection. Quality of the parts seem to be good and the card stock isn't bad. You will need a big table for this game as you are exploring a multiple floored mansion.

  Fun game but the pieces have such a horrible paint job. Probably pretentious to whine about that but seriously so ugly. Each figure only had 3 colors. I'm repainting them because I hated it so much and even if you don't have painting skills, it's mandatory to at least paint the base color to correlate to the piece color since pieces like purple only had a tiny purple tank top, and red has just as much blue  as the blue piece.Pic included shows 1 I finished (green), 2 WIP (yellow is almost done and purple just started), and the last 3 I've only added a bit of flesh tone and base primer.

  I've been wanting this game for awhile and just bought it as it was on a good sale.  I loved the idea behind the game and knew it would be a fun game to play.  Thankfully I wasn't disappointed!We played it for the first time last night with 5 players and everyone enjoyed it!  We all agreed that the way the ""board"" changes as you choose which rooms to explore was an interesting feature.  The game isnt too difficult to learn and we only needed a short time to go over the basic rules and begin playing.  Our first game took about 1.5-2 hours which wasn't bad for a brand new game none of us had played before.The pieces were all of pretty decent quality, the only small issue I found was the character pieces are made of a soft plastic material and one of them was bent at an angle slightly, but it was easy to correct by bending the piece the other way to straighten it out.One thing to note is you may want to get some of the small Ziploc bags (snack size would work well) to separate the smaller token categories as there are a LOT of small tokens of different types and keeping them organized looks like it could be a pain.  We spent a lot of time both at the beginning of the game and at the start of the haunt phase sorting through the tokens to find the ones we needed for the scenario.Overall I would say this game is more than worth it!

  We have had this game for roughly three days now and have played Throw Throw Burrito every night since receiving it in the mail. My family has multiple closets full of games and this is our favorite, hands down, better than Pictionary, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, Operation, Jenga, Boggle, Scrabble, ConnectFour, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, the Tempest, Hamlet, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona combined. Let me be clear: This...game...kicks...BURRITO. First of all, it's simple. You keep five cards in hand at all times and draw from a pile and discard into another as fast as you can, in order to make matching sets. Everyone draws and discards at the same time and usually the game is a giant mess. Second, you throw burritos at each other. You heard me. Occasionally someone draws a set of burrito cards, and then you have to throw burritos at your family members. Sometimes there are tears. Sometimes your daughter gouges one of the burritos with her overlong fingernails, triggering your obsessiveness to keep things looking brand new. Sometimes she gets so angry that she pummels you repeatedly with one of the burritos until her father tells her to stop beating up her mother. Sometimes the dog jumps up and down thinking you are screaming in pain when your are only laughing hysterically as your husband bashes you with a foam burrito. Let me be clear. This is a card game. This is dodge ball. It is the best thing that has happened to our family since the birth of our child.*not really bruised

  We're hosting an extended family game night next week and I wanted something new & different to play that everyone would enjoy. Our family loves rummy, PIT! and other card games so I figured I'd give 'Throw Throw Burrito' a try, even though we've never played or purchased 'Exploding Kittens' or any other of their games. And also even though someone in my family tends to injure themselves every single time we all get together.Yesterday when this arrived, my husband and I sat down to learn how to play so that we can teach everyone else on game night. It is easy to learn and appropriate for all ages. It was great fun playing this, even with just two people, and it'd be a lot more fun with a bigger group.So I matched the 'Burrito War' cards which means everyone grabs for a burrito and throw it at another player. I whipped a burrito at my husband's chest except it accidentally hit him in the face because 1) I have terrible (or great?) aim and 2) we were sitting at very close range to each other.Consequently, he informed me that 'we' are not allowed to play this game anymore. When he said 'we' I knew he meant me. I am not allowed to play because I cannot be trusted to not hit him in the face with a squishy burrito. He hid the box but I know where and I am totally breaking this out on family game night!

  We tried this game for the first time at a work party, with eight adults spanning four decades in age. Needless to say the ensuing play was hilariously funny and after playing six rounds of the game we were coming up with crazy ideas as to how we could turn it into an all day office game or even take it outside and play across larger distances.Other reviews have called the game ""immature as heck"", but our group found it to be completely hilarious and appropriate for all ages.Note that we played with eight people at the table despite the game only being made for 2-6. I would recommend playing with no fewer than 4 as the rules get modified to accommodate fewer players and it would be significantly less fun. On the flip side, although the game say up to six players, we made it work for eight by reducing each player's personal draw deck that is dealt at the beginning from 15 cards down to 10. It works, but one or two ""slow"" players can lead to all of the cards ending up at one end of the table and the other end waiting for cards to be passed. I wish they had an expansion pack to add more cards and more burritos for an all out ""burrito war"".

Was easy to learn and play. My 5 year old was a bit too young so we just team up and he is my burrito wing man. I'm hoping the burritos last and the dog doesn't get one during the action of the battles. They seem not so durable as they are made of foam, as to not hurt anyone with the flinging, but super cute.

Expect your kids to find joy in throw throwing the stupid burrito in your face
","

  I may or may not have cussed a few times playing this game with my kids. My older son had perfect aim at my face and has won every single time we have palyed. If your family has a secret revenge they are trying to find an outlet for, dont buy. This game could possibly break your family apartWe had a lot of fun, apparently I play too slow, and my kids enjoy throwing things at me when given the opportunity. Now I only play when I'm ready to be smashed in the face with a burrito. Good thing the burrito is super soft, so at least it doesn't hurt (only my feeling and ego).

Easy to learn, really chaotic
","

  The game is basically spoons with a twist, so it is easy to learn for all ages. Great for kids, but not so fun for slower grown ups, hahaha. The game pieces are high quality.That said, it is frustrating to play in a small space, and dangerous around nice things. So, we basically have to take an inside card game outside in the wind and elements, OR play an outside dodge ball game inside the house and risk injury or damage to our stuff. So, it is more of a novelty than a game we will be playing often.

Love It, But Do Not Underestimate the Size of the Extreme Outdoors Edition üòÖüòÖ
","

  Got the game today (sorry for taking the pics in the bathroom, only place in the house with good lighting).Immediately upon receiving this game I was excited. I opened the box and blew up the inflatable Burrito and boy did not expect the ginormous size üòÖ. I know they said ginormous in the description but I was expecting like 1 foot. I was wrong. This thing is 3 feet tall and it is a feat in itself just trying to blow it up (took me stleast 10 minutes)! But let me tell you, when you do get it blownup, you cannot wait to throw it at someone! Just the thought of chucking this ginormous burrito at someone was enough to make me so excited for my next game night! I was worried about being able to throw it, because of it's size and that it is full of air, but it has just enough weight to it that you can definitely throw it at another person and have it actually travel.This version of the game comes with 2 Burritos (pictures for scale (I am 5'7"" with 2"" boots on in the pictures)), 2 decks of oversized cards (pictures for scale), and what feel like rubber game pieces (flimsy, bit very solid). The Burritos have two air holes (one at the top to fill the burrito toppings section and one at the bottom to fill the whole burrito). The Box that the game comes in has great storage inside and even has a handle on it for easier travel.I love this game already. I havent played it yet but wow I cannot wait to try it out with my friends next game night!

  My 11-year-old daughter really wanted this game for her birthday. I had low expectations (card game + dodgeball??), but I got it for her, knowing full well I was going to end up having to play it many times because that's just how it is. OK. Turns out, though, it's actually pretty fun, even with only two players. And I'm not even a particular fan of games overall. Who knew throwing a squishy burrito at the person you love most in the world would be so cathartically hilarious?P.S. We enjoyed it so much we ended up sending one as a gift to another family as well.

  I only took away one star because this has ended with angry players on several occasions.  One occasion with crying.  I suggest making a house rule that head shots are off limits if you play with kids or anyone who doesn't like getting hit in the face with a foam burrito.  We haven't had a bloody nose yet, but I do think you could get a bloody nose if you were hit just right with enough velocity.

  Fun game!  I bought it for Easter to give to our daughter, figuring we would ah e lots of town to play games during quarantine.  She had played at an American Heritage Girls meeting and LOVED it so I knew she would be excited.I was right, she was bouncing up and down like she just won the lottery!The game was intense.  A kid won.  Fun was had.  Burritos were both torn after ONE round.  Bummer.  One was a tiny tear (lost some burrito toppings)  the other was pretty bad so I tried super gluing it back together.  Now we have a hard sharp spot on one of them, that we hope doesn‚Äôt give us a scar above the eyebrow.  I mean for the late great Luke Perry it would work....me?  Not so much.Maybe we are just too competitive a family?  Stick to things which do not require throwing?

  We have been bored with the same games for family game night and I bought this for same day delivery. Received it and played last night, SO WORTH IT! This game is a blast! We played with 3 players and there were laughs all around. The instructions seem a little overwhelming when you try to read them so we watched the video, like it actually says to do lol. Even the video was kinda long, but the instructions are simple enough and you get the hang of it after 1 round. Great family or party game. In fact, I may buy another one for when we have guests we have more burritos to through for the burrito wars.

Very fun game, I think I would consider purchasing the tabletop version over this outdoor one
","

  Purchased this and took it right to a family party. It was incredibly fun for those who wanted to be very active and have a laugh. For others it wasn't as well received as the pace can be overwhelming for new players. I will say the biggest let down was the durability of the burritos. One burrito only lasted 3 games before getting punctured by a tomato plant..... To be fair it was a very ominous looking tomato plant but it was rather shocking that it would become damaged so quickly. The game comes with a patch kit which was needed and I'm grateful for but as the instructions state you should wait to play with the burrito until the patch has cured which ended that game for the day.With that being said the game is a lot of fun. I wish the cards were a little more durable and maybe a little smaller even for the outdoor game. Would recommend to players of the original game.

  This is an easy to learn game that our 10 year old son LOVES.  It's a basic match three game, but with random dodge ball matches breaking out!  The only issue we struggle with is that with a three person game, and around an average sized dining room table, burrito wars resolve themselves without anyone even moving from their seats.  I bet this will be an even greater game for our son to enjoy with his friends in a larger group post COVID-19.

  I love this game. It was first introduced to me at a get together we have once a year with the boys. We play games online together all year around, but once a year we get together in person to play physical games. One of the guys pulled this game out one night when we had a little too much to drink and it was the funniest game of the whole weekend. I bought it as soon as I got back home. I have not been disappointed. It's easy to transport, easy to explain, and easy to play. Makes for a great party game.I got hit directly in the eye(lid) with a burrito and it's so soft my only reaction was to laugh. I don't think it's possible to hurt someone with these burritos. I don't know what they're made of... they're softer than marshmallows yet they will last forever (unless your dog gets one maybe?).

  I have no idea how to play this game.  We played with a 3 year old and a 6 year old and managed to adjust the rules so that everyone was able to keep up, we went around the circle and dealt a new card to each person and announced matches (rather than everyone sorting through a pile and setting aside matches for themselves).  Anyway, lots of easy games to invent loosely based off the suggested rules.  As long as you keel the ‚ÄúDuel‚Äù, ‚ÄúWar‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrawl‚Äù part everyone will be happy.  My 3 year old was very much excited to be allowed and actually encouraged to throw something at someone.  I actually think this helped us all get some aggression out in a fun way.

  I haven't heard my daughter laugh so hard the whole time school has been canceled(except maybe when she's making videos of herself), and we haven't even played the game proper, yet. It's a dodge ball card game where you throw squishy burritos at each other. So far we've only been throwing one back and forth at each other and she's the definition of delighted. Highly recommend for quarantined families. Keep it away from your dog, though, he could probably rip it up.

  We like to have game night with our teenaged nephews and their parents and this game was a hit. Prepare to do more than sit on your rear end though, because duels are full-out contact sports ‚Äì at least that's what they turned into in our family. The basics are easy enough to comprehend, but with trying to remember what the rules are for a ""battle"" vs a ""war"" vs whatever else the rest of them are, it can get a bit confusing.

  We‚Äôve played this several times as a family, and it is hilarious. I would think carefully about playing near flat screen TVs or other breakable objects, because some players may get jumpy, and things could get bumped. The burritos are pretty light and soft/squishy, so the only real damage they could do is knocking a glass over or hitting something small. It‚Äôs the players that could do damage, in our house!If you like this, we recommend Exploding Kittens and the expansion packs, as well as Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza. All fun, with very different methods of play.

  When I got this game is was anticipating a fun couple plays, maybe I would even enjoy it. I was so unaware of the chaotic fun that was waiting.

  So far the game works fine. It has all the pieces, and the buzzer and light works well.I was glad there was a classic version available, but I didn't remember the ice cream cone in the head. I looked it up and saw that the ice cream came along in 2004; that's pretty late to be ""classic."" I wish it was exactly like the one I had as a kid. I wonder why companies keep making ""classic"" and ""retro"" editions of games and toys but including changes that make the game or toy not the way it was. It's still better than playing on one of the new boards, but the fake parts in the classic/retro games are sad reminders that we may never again play the same games we played as kids.Dear Milton Bradley,Please stop with the ridiculous Star Wars and Frozen and every-Disney-movie versions of all of our old games.

Kids, this is NOT your parents' Operation Game...
","

  I was soooo excited to gift this game to our 5yr old daughter. It was my favorite game when I was a kid. So, when I saw the classic edition, it was a no-brainier. Although the appeal of the game has stood the test of time, the quality of this game is less than acceptable. The small white playing pieces are made so much more cheaply than the original game. Many of the pieces cannot be played the same way we did as kids. For example, as a kid I would remove the butterfly by pinching the raised worm-body - that piece of plastic is no longer thick enough to grasp. The same can be said for the spare ribs and the water bucket. What is odd is that the ""new piece"" of an ice cream cone representing brain freeze is visibly thicker than the old pieces and can be played by grasping the details on the cone rather than the edges. Most upsetting is that the sides of the all the pieces are slightly beveled, making it REALLY hard to grasp with the tweezers when they are face up. In fact, the charlie horse is so beveled that it is UNPLAYABLE! I'm taping over it in so no one will even try to remove it because it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove and only play with this piece only ends in tears. There is obviously a problem with the way the white playing pieces are being manufactured - a result of corporate greed, no doubt. I am very displeased with this new version of the game and will seek out a vintage version at thrift shops and antique stores to replace this major disappointment. I gave the game 3 stars because it is still a super cool game, but if I could, I would only give it 1 star for quality of play. I give the original game 5 stars.

THE ORIGINAL!
","

  I bought my son an operation at Toys R Us last year.  When we first played it, I thought he had a career as a surgeon.  He was able to clean out all of the bones and body parts without a single buzzer.  I remembered that when I was a kid, it was nearly impossible to get the parts out of the body without setting off the buzzer.  I was also a little annoyed that instead of realish body parts, the game was full of cell phones and head phones and other silly things.Then I discovered that the game had been changed and made much much easier.  Thus started my hunt for the original operation, which THIS is (although there is an added piece in the brain that was apparently added in the late 2000s.  THIS version is what I remember from my childhood: difficult bone removal with an almost guaranteed buzzer, parts that slide so far out of reach that you can barely see them, and an actual challenge.

  It is so lite in weight that you can't play it without securing it to the table. It used to be a loud and obnoxious game, but now the buzz is so underwhelming you barely flinch. When you do touch the edges the buzz starts real slow and hardly revs up. Maybe my childhood was just so flippin' awesome that I didn't notice this game was actually like that when I was a kid, but I don't think so.

Get the ""classic"" version sold by amazon llc
","

  This game was recently updated to include stupid things like a cell phone, a green gas cloud coming out the back end and a toilet. Seriously? I feel like I'm living in the movie ""Idiocracy"" where everyone giggles every time reference is made to farts or butts. It took me some time, but I finally found a CLASSIC version sold by amazon. There is still one change from when I was a kid in the 80's - they've added an ice cream cone in Sam's head for ""brain freeze."" This version, unlike the ""gas"" version, still comes with the ""operation"" cards and money. This is apparently something that was done away with in the newer version. Love the classic game, it works beautifully and I would buy it again.

~~ A classic that is still worth playing! That Charlie Horse is still the hardest! ~~
","

  If you played this years ago as a child you can rest assured it is the same today! My original version was lost many moons ago and so we purchased this for our 7 year old's birthday. What a blast from the past!There are 12 body parts to remove and one (ankle bone to the knee bone) to connect. Yes, Sam's nose still buzzes and goes red if you touch the metal with your ""operating"" tool! 2AA batteries (required) are NOT provided.The body parts come all attached on one piece of plastic so you will need to remove these before play can commence. I would also recommend a ziplock bag to keep the money and doctor/specialist cards in as there is no compartment in the game. The playing board measures approximately 8 3/4"" x 15"".We purchased this at full price. We were not required to write a review but chose to do so. Thanks, Liz

","

  I bought this for my kids for Christmas. I knew I wanted to get the classic version from the beginning, and i'm glad I did. It is so much better. Tue new version is too easy. The holes are bigger and the pieces are bigger. Not to mention, the pieces are weird items like a cellphone and frog. Also, the new version doesn't come with the cards or money the classic one does. I highly suggest if you're looking into getting the Operation game, that you get the Classic version. My only complaint is that the game itself is very light weight. So when it buzzes, the whole thing moves a bit. I don't remember it being like that when I was a kid, but maybe it was. All in all, this is a very fun game. We all love to play it. Both of my kids can play, ages 3 & 6.

Total disappointment - the buzzer doesn't even work anymore, which makes this really lame...
","

  ""Back in my day"" we played operation and if we touched the side we literally jumped in the air because the buzzer was so loud and intense... With this in mind I thought it'd be a great game to play with the 8 year old. However, when we got the game I touched the metal and was met with a very quiet ""buzz"" that needed to ""rev"" up before it was actually a ""buzz""... The version I remember playing would buzz the second you touched the metal - this version is totally lame.Avoid at all costs and make Amazon fix their stupid ""Amazon Exclusive"" version.

Childhood memories

  I was planning on saving this one for Christmas, but I just couldn't wait to let my boys play with it. This game freaked me out as a kid so as any other good mother would do I wanted my kids to experience the same fear that I had playing this game. We opened it up today and the game did not disappoint. My boys shrieked in laughter and excitement trying to perform each operation. The game doesn't scare them like it did me as a kid, but it's still fun to watch them play.

  Batteries aren't included if you can read definitely do so because it clearly says it in their description, but anyway it came in such good condition,it was wrapped up nicely, the money and cards were also wrapped up nicely, I have no clue what the people in the reviews are talking about that it was a mess,nope straight up lies.Everything is just great but the buzzer isn't that loud unless if you hold it on the metal thing for too long.

Not what it used to be

  First of all there is no buzzer sound. It just vibrates and the nose lights up. There's no sound. Problem is because they are using a Vibration it shakes all the pieces and they slide under the space some vanishing from site all together.The board is flimsy and bows if you put any pressure on it.Young kids might not care but it doesn't work the same as the classic and is very flimsy obviously to cut cost and increase profit.It required 2AA Batteries not included and you need a very SMALL screw driver to get the battery cover off to install them.

It'd be more ""proof"" to my little kids when they touch the sides, and have to ""let the specialist take over""!All-in-all, it is a fun game, requires 2x AA batteries, and is a true ""blast from your past"" game.

Very disappointing
","

  I wish I had bothered to read the reviews before ordering this game. Paid $ 40 to get the ""original"" version of this game and instead got the so called updated version which has large holes and rubbish items to take out and that's it.Applied to return it but couldn't without talking to customer service. After explaining the problem she said she would issue a return slip and send the game I had ordered, which by then had gone up an incredible $ 20  to $ 60. She did agree though I should have it at the original price I ordered it for and was going to issue a $ 20 credit to my account.I presumed the matter was sorted until two days after when I received the exact same game from Amazon. I again could not return the game without talking to customer service but was unable to explain anything more than I wanted to return the game. The fact I still wanted to order the original game did not sink in with the cs agent. The agent merely commiserated with me when I said I still wanted the game and could I get it through Amazon or not as so far it didn't seem likely. The ""I understand how you feel"" comment I got made me decide to give up, particularly when, as I was chatting with the cs agent I noted that in the last two days the price again had risen by another $ 10.I've now bought it through Ebay, at least I hope I have. It's a shame as I never had an unpleasant experience with Amazon before.

Higher quality than most new board games

  I had this game from when I was a child in the late 80s/ early 90s.  I was disappointed when I pulled it out to play with my 4 year old and it didn‚Äôt work, so I bought this one and I am pretty satisfied.  It is identical to the old one except it has one more piece.  It is pretty close quality-wise.  Just a little less plastic in the base but way higher quality than most of the new flimsy board games.  I buy a lot of vintage board games on eBay bc of the low quality of newer games, but I am happy when the purchase and my daughter loves playing.

Fun But

  I had one many years ago and loved it as a kid. But I forgot how hard it is, plus they have made it harder to play I think.. They have made the tweezers rounded with a little knob on the end (safety? - silly) that makes it very hard to get them in the tiny slots, much less open them and grasp the items. Really need to make the slots bigger. We don't play it much because it is too hard and the kids lose interest fast.  Our Grandkids, age 7 and 5 can't do it very well.

  This is pretty much the Operation I remember. Or at least as close as it's going to get. Avoid the other version with the horrible reviews.

  Game is very good and teaches little hands how to get a grip (!), so to speak. Circuitry works great.Problem is the pieces are so small that you tend to lose them easily. I think the set comes with 15 pieces and within one week my son had lost more than half of them. The pieces are cheap plastic, why not just include a couple of spare sets with the game (wouldn't cost 10-20 cents more for the manufacturer to include spares).

Wrong Game

  We love the game Blockbuster, we played it with friends and then ordered it for ourself. However, we didn‚Äôt actually receive the Blockbuster game we ordered. Instead we received a game called Chameleon. Once my children saw it they asked me not to return it because it looks fun. But we are a little disappointed that we didn‚Äôt get the game we has ordered.

  The main reason why I decided to write this review is because I wanted more people to know that this game is conducive to ""remote"" gaming with friends. We are still sheltering in place due to COVID-19, and were able to play with friends using a conferencing software, whichever one you have (Facetime, Zoom, Google Hangouts, or other), even though only one group physically owned the game. Super fun! Hope an expansion pack is coming soon!

  My family absolutely loves this game so much fun! Head to head battle cards are a heated competition in our house. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that you go through the 200 movie cards pretty fast. They need to have an extended movie card pack with at least 200+more cards. If they sold more movie cards we would definitely buy those.

  its intense.. since everything is timed but its super easy to learn and really fun. we ended up making a couple of our own rules like... sequels are ok to say but only if they have a unique title. Saw  and Saw 2 wouldn't be ok. Rules say first to get one in each genre wins, but we play til the end of the round still.. if there's a tie we do a final head to head but the entire team gets to go in on it.great game, great packaging... the nostalgia is strong with this one.

Surprisingly complex
","

  I've only planed as a 2 person game with my husband. The first few times I played it, I thought, ""eh, it's fun, but not much to it strategy wise"". Boy was I wrong. The real strategy for us comes from trying to take over and block each other's cities. It becomes intense hoping to draw the exact card needed to either block our opponent from from connecting the cities or hoping to draw the card that does connect the cities that either neutralizes a high scoring city your opponent has created or taking control by having more meeples on the connected portions. The  abbot meeple that can be removed at any time also allows for strategic point building. Also, I like to block my opponent from being able to complete cities by placing pieces with roads pointing in certain directions that make it more difficult for a city piece to fit. The way we play it, this game is anything but boring. For the reviews that say it's boring or not nuanced enough are probably no playing as ruthlessly as my husband and I. :-)Despite everything said above, this game is also a great game for families with younger kids as it can be played in a more relaxed and less cutthroat manner where each party focuses on building their own cities and roads. I give this game a two meeples up!

Want to encourage critical thinking in kids?  Buy this game...
","

  This is what I was looking for.Having only recently gotten into board-gaming, I immediately set my sights on ""heavy"", strategy-focused board games.  Unfortunately, those almost all proved to be too intense for my wife, and so my new goal is to get my daughter into strategy games, so I'll have someone to play with.  :)Unfortunately, so many kids games are luck-based, relying on dice or spinners (I hate spinners) while not requiring a single ounce of skill.  Candyland, Sorry, Chutes & Ladders - these are the bane of our existence...With my daughter recently turning five, I wanted to find a game for her would require her to think, to plan ahead, to strategize, and to consider aspects of the game happening in her peripheral.  This game does just that.  It's hard for her, and that's just what kids need - a challenge.Gameplay is ridiculously simple - draw a tile, and place it anywhere on the board.  If your newly placed card finishes a road on which kids are shown playing, you place meeples matching the colors of those children on their icons.  The first player to have all (8) of their meeples on the board wins the game.A kid of course draws a card, sees their color depicted on the tile and gets excited.  But the ability to plan ahead and strategically aim to place that or other tiles in order to score points doesn't come as naturally.  Furthermore, seeing where another player is close to earning points and strategically playing to earn points alongside them (a closed road allows ALL players to place meeples where applicable along said road) is a difficult gameplay tactic for kids to grasp.  But, as I see it, losing a few games - and helping the kids to understand where they could have taken advantage of opportunities - will open them up to those concepts and help them learn.The only down-side I've experienced is, since this game isn't really ""branded,"" it doesn't contain any relatable elements to encourage my kid to play.  I have to wonder if a ""Disney"" version of this game would do wonders to get my daughter to play it more often.  Still, I encourage play often, and watching her eyes flick over the ever-building town of tiles as she thinks about the questions I pose to her during play is exciting.

Fun for Five or for Two
","

  There has been a board game renaissance here lately, and I have missed out on it.  So I thought hosting family for Christmas would be a good excuse to check out some of the new board games.After a trip to Barnes and Noble derailed by sticker shock and a certain misunderstanding between me and my wife over what I meant by ‚Äúlet‚Äôs buy a board game,‚Äù there were two conditions.  One, we needed a game that five players could play (so Settlers of Catan was out).  Two, we needed a game five board game beginners could figure out on the fly (so the Game of Thrones board game was out‚Äîone reviewer suggested each player watch the instructional video and one player read the instruction manual cover to cover twice).  Carcassonne met both conditions and was priced to sell so we went for it.It turned out to be a great choice.  For all the medieval trappings it is, as my father-in-law pointed out, ultimately a real estate game.  It‚Äôs a straightforward set up.  Each player places tiles with some combination of three features (road, city, abbey) and places ‚Äúmeeples‚Äù to control features.  That‚Äôs it, tiles and meeples.  No paper and pen are necessary and scores are kept by meeple on an accompanying scoreboard.I‚Äôve played three games so far, two with five players and one with two players.  The first game we tried to play on the fly and, well, we screwed a bunch of the rules up but it was fun nonetheless.  I read the short instruction manual between games and by the second game we had everything figured out.  Five player games are hectic.  You only get to put down so many tiles, and your plans will constantly be affected by moves by other players.  This was the most fun part, as every other turn devolved into half-shouted attempts at cutting backroom deals (we had been drinking).  This is in contrast to the two player game I played with my wife, where we mostly played our own way, occasionally trying to place a tile to thwart the other‚Äôs plans (which seems tough to do).The replayability, I think, will be high.  My wife is up for more Carcassonne game nights, and we already have a request to bring the game for Christmas.  Three or four people is probably the ideal number to play, though.  There is a lot of luck involved (i.e., the tiles you draw), but there are enough different ways to play tiles to keep it interesting for a while, especially with more players.  The biggest flaw, I think, is that there is no penalty for failure to terminate roads and surround abbeys, only for failure to wall off cities.  Board Game Geek lists the playing time as 30 ‚Äì 45 minutes, but each of our games went well beyond that (we should really introduce a chess timer).  The basic set comes with river tiles and an abbot meeple that we haven‚Äôt played with yet (two separate mini-expansions).UPDATE:We played another 5-player game with the river expansion tiles.  The additional rules are admirably straightforward (and the reason we started with that instead of the abbot).  It did make a big difference.  It really spread the game out.  For a 5-player game, that meant a lot less of the wheeling-and-dealing and backstabbing I talked about above.  It was difficult, though, to do our own thing with so few turns and tiles per player.  I think I prefer it without the river tiles, but that may be a bug or a feature, depending on your perspective.

  Having enjoyed the basic Carcassonne game, we decided to take up the difficulty a notch and add some novelty to the game.  This game series is fantastic because of the expansion options.  Based on Amazon reviews, I chose Inns & Cathedrals to be the first expansion set I would experiment with.  I am happy with the end result.  I am considering adding the Traders & Builders s expansion to my set, but I feel like this will make the game more like Catan.  If you like Catan, that might be the better expansion to start with.  Overall I think Inns & Cathedrals is the most logical step forward in the Carcassonne universe, and Traders & Builders would be next.When I ordered the item, I was concerned about two seemingly opposite issues. First, I wanted to make sure the art would match up with my Carcassonne base set.  I have the original set with the newer art, not the older, classic art of the first editions.  Second, I worried that the Inns & Cathedrals tiles would blend so well into the game that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to pull them out and separate them again.  Fortunately, neither issue occurred.  The art matches well and the tiles blend in seamlessly, however, the expansion tiles are each tagged with a tiny meeple shadow somewhere on the face of the tile so you can see which tiles are from the expansion set.Regarding actual game play, the addition of new tiles does take some getting used to but even beginning players will be able to figure it out.  It adds a new dimension to the game and makes things more excited.  The games don‚Äôt last much longer than the original game, I would say maybe 10-15 minutes longer on average, but I am not yet an expert on this expansion pack so I‚Äôm not sure how much time it will add to the game in the long-run.  The addition of the ‚Äúsuper meeple‚Äù is also fun.A note on packaging -- I think the packaging is somewhat wasteful, as you receive a fairly large box that contains a few sheets of tiles, a bag of meeples, and quite a bit of empty space.Bottom line:  It‚Äôs a great expansion to the game, probably the first one that I would choose if you are looking to spice up your Carcassonne.

My wife and I have a new favorite game!
","

  It did not take long for Carcassonne to become my and my wife's favorite game.  The concept is simple: place a tile, place a meeple, score a feature.  A typical game with the base game only will take us 30-40 minutes.  However, with the addition of multiple expansions created for Carcassonne, we have held 2 hour + marathons of pure enjoyment.  Simple to learn, simple to play, but difficult to master.  The game changes every time as you are creating the board as you play. It is a wonderful concept, and provides a great experience.  The many expansions add a ton of replayability, and we enjoy mixing a few of them in with this original game to keep it new and exciting. Highly recommended... a must have for any game shelf!

Must have expansion
","

  This is a must-have expansion for Carcassonne. It really adds to the base game in needed ways. This expansion makes working towards roads actually worth going for, as the inns double the amount each road is worth. It also makes building large cities a worthwhile strategy if you are able to get a cathedral tile in the city. The expansion also includes additional much needed basic tiles that help complete cities that bump into roads or other obstructions. Anyone who has and enjoys Carcassonne cannot go wrong by adding in this expansion. Plus this expansion does not change the basic gameplay of the game like many of the other expansion tend to do. I never play Carcassonne without this expansion.

Another great expansion pack for the 2015 edition base Carcassonne game
","

  Another great expansion pack for the 2015 edition base Carcassonne game. The builder meeple makes completing large cities much easier with the extra turn you get when using it. The pig changes the point value when playing the farmers in the fields from 3 points per city to 4. The extra tile pieces are great. The goods (wine, wheat, and cloth) are extra points at the end of the game, 30 points available, 10 each if you have the most of that particular good, shared if there's a tie. And the bag for the tile pieces is very handy, it's large enough to hold all the tiles from the base game and expansions 1 and 2 (that's our regular game play). This is our go to game right now and the expansions for it make more interesting and challenging.

Great Game for 4 - 6 Year Olds
","

  SUMMARY - My First Carcassonne is an excellent game for young children that teaches some basic strategy and is still fun for adults.HOW TO PLAY - The game consists of large chunky tiles that have a road on each side - some roads end and some connect to another side. Some roads also have children of one of the four colors.  When a road is closed on both sides, a meeple can be placed on all children on the road.  The goal of the game is to be the first to place all your meeples.The light strategy in the game is deciding when to close a road.  I can close this road and place one of my meeples, but my opponent will be able to place two - not a good move.WHO IS IT FOR - Families with young children.  I'd say 4-6 years old is about right - older kids are ready for the full Carcassonne.PROS - Quick playing, beautiful artwork, and not just blind luck like most children's games.CONS - I think this appeals to a limited age range.CONCLUSION - My 5 year old son loves this game.  He really enjoys being able to build a little town out of all the tiles.  Very highly recommended.

quick! to the boats!

  So this is another great addition to the global tour of Carcassonne, and meshes some game dynamics from ""hunter gatherer"" and regular Carcassonne.jungles, villages and tributaries score you points much like fields, castles and roads did respectively, but the amazon river itself adds some new levels of chance. the immediate scoring of ""river tiles"" means that points can come out of nowhere for your opponent or for you when drawing one of these tiles. It adds a rather more race like feel to part of the game as you try to keep your boat in first place to get these points.absolutely wonderful game though, great art, and just wonderful to play. hope this review helped.

Carcassonne is a Winner in the Game World
","

  This game is a wonderful option for those who like simple and complex games alike. The game is for 2-5 players, and it is equally fun regardless the size of your group! The game comes with a base city/road beginner piece for simplicity, but this particular version also has The River and The Abbot Mini Expansion Pack. You can choose to play with or without the expansion. Game time is anywhere from 15-45 minutes depending on number of players and whether your group plays fast or likes conversation and enjoying a glass of wine or bowl of ice cream.It's a great family game, too. The box suggests 7+ years old, but we had a 5 year old play along with us just fine, and it's his favorite game now (he is a quite strategic little fellow, though). The rules and game play are relatively easy to figure out, and any rules not clear in the directions (there aren't many) can either be cleared up by a quick web search or the game owner can choose their preference and claim ""house rules"". ;)SUMMARY:Lots of fun, can be simple or complicated, great for kids and adults alike, fast game play (no waiting for long turns to be completed), easy-to-learn/easy-to-follow rules, bright and beautiful colors, and no game is ever the same! Never gets boring!

Finally back in print!

  This is a reprint of The Kids of Carcassonne.  My husband and I are big fans of the Carcassonne games and wanted to be able to share the games with our 4 year old.  He loves games and this is a great way to introduce tile-laying games to young kids.  The tiles are large, thick cardboard, and are beautiful.  They are easy for kids to pick up and move, and they seem very durable.  The kid meeples are large and made of wood.  Players randomly choose tile to lay as they try to complete paths and then place their colored meeple tokens on the tiles.  It encourages kids to think about how to place the tiles so they can finish paths with their color.  The player to place all of their meeples first is the winner.  The game plays in about 20 minutes and it's more fun than many of the games aimed at 3-7 year olds.  We've already played a bunch of times and I'm very glad this is back in print.

Long Live the Meeple!!

  Considering we have more than 150 recorded plays of this game (when you add in every mini-expansion and variant) you'd rightfully assume it to be among our favorite games of all time. . . you wouldn't be wrong. Carcassonne has all the hallmarks we look for: easy to play, learn and teach gateway tile laying mechanic with more strategic depth than at first glance, great art and theme, plays quickly with evident scoring and above all it's fun! Whenever we tire of the base game it's so easy to refresh by adding in a full expansion, or mini-expansion or two or three. When we want a more novel tile laying experience we get out one of the superb variants like H & G or South Seas or Gold Rush. We feel this pioneering game should be the cornerstone of any great gaming collection. Long live the meeple!

  I have been looking for a boardgame that is not LEGO for a while- (we play the stuffin out of our LEGO boardgames). I've looked, and Pintrest'd more than I should have. I stumbled on this game by chance on Amazon, and bought it. OMW! This is so incredibly fun/challenging. My 8 yo son loves it! and picked up on it right away. He played with his friend the other day, and explained the rules of play easily. We play with just the Basic game, have not played with Rivers/ abbot yet. The box/ tiles are very sturdy- although storage for all those tiles are a pain. (There are little boxes that you can printout for all your tiles- search TUCKBOXES). The game is fun, never the same. I definitely recommend this game for families/couples. We will play soon with the Rivers expansion set, and hope to add more expansions on later. This game will not get stuffed in the game closet, it's been in use most days of the week- fun enough to keep both my kids off the computer/tv, and asking to play!

Strategic yet understandable - fun for kids and adults
","

  Simple enough that my 3.5-year-old quickly understood how to play, but deep enough that my husband and I really enjoy it. The little one doesn't really understand the strategy, but it's great to talk him through it and help him understand that he needs to finish his roads and not helps us finish our roads.As far as comparison to regular Carcassone, it is roads only. Every tile has roads on every side so that they all fit together in any combination. Each tile has pre-placed meeples (or rather, children) so you don't decide whether to place at the end of your turn, and when you finish a road you can use your wooden meeple to mark that it is completed. You need to finish roads with 8 of your color children to win. Often you are forced to place other players' children.

Best board game ever
","

  I guess this is a board game because the pieces are cardboard, but it's not a board game in the sense that you move pieces around and advance ahead on a board.  This is a fantastic tile laying game and my husband and I are addicted to it.  You take turns laying a scene down, one road, one field, one village at a time.  As you lay the pieces down, you claim that particular space by placing your pawn or ""meeple"" on it.  You have only 8 meeples, so you have to use them judiciously.  But once you have completed laying a road, for example, you can move your score ahead and remove your meeple to use elsewhere.  The tiles are sturdy, the artwork is bright and attractive, the meeples are durable and bright as well.  My only HUGE complaint about this game is the ridiculous scoreboard they give you.  This little board only goes up to 50.  If you score beyond that, you have to sort of lay your scoring marker down, so as not to confuse it with another player's marker who might be well behind you.  Let's say your opponent is only on the 30th space on the scoreboard, but you're well ahead of that--you've moved past 50 and have 30 more points.  Now you're sharing the space with your opponent, but his meeple is standing up and yours has to be laying down.  And if you forget to lay him down once you've moved beyond 50, then you're out of luck and it's hard to prove later on who's got what.  Anyway, this is confusing, I know.  It's a big mess and one that could have been avoided with a better scoreboard.  I made my own that folds out in a trifold and it goes all the way up to 150.  So four stars for a fantastic game, but I'm taking one star off for poor design of the scoreboard.

  I bought this expansion because I wanted to be able to add another player to the base game. I'm happy ""Inns and Cathedrals"" accomplishes this feat because it allows all of my friends to play Carcassone at once--no one has to sit out on game night.With that being said, the new tiles don't add much to the game. Their art style matches the base game and the other expansions I've seen, which is to be expected. But their colors are a little more vibrant.On the down side: the meeples are all different sizes. It's not particularly noticeable, but some of them are a bit taller than others. Some are a bit wider, and a few have stubby or lopsided arms. If this is the sort of thing that bothers you, I'm sorry. Furthermore, I wished the new tiles added a little more depth to the game.Otherwise, this game was a nice addition to my growing collection.

Great Carcassonne inspired kids' game
","

  I was excited to buy this game since I'm a fan of Carcassonne and other similar games.  I have a 3 year old and bought this in preparation for his graduation from Candyland and other mind numbing games to something a bit more bearable for my adult tastes.  So, I'm going into this possibly a bit of a gaming snob.Immediately I was impressed by the quality of the product.  I let my son ""play"" with the pieces as I opened the box.  The pieces are very large, heavy, and durable most likely able to withstand abuse from younger children who may not be as tactful when handling game components.  There was also a fair amount of pieces, so game length is a sweet spot where its long enough to have fun and let the game unfold, but not too long where it drags on.  The art was in style with the original Carcassonne with some additional details and colors that I would imagine would be well received by kids.The game is played a bit differently where kids wearing different colored outfits are running along the roads and every piece is a 4 sided option with some ending roads, some turning, and some continuing straight.  No puzzle piecing pieces together - every piece fits every other piece, so even small kids who may not grasp the concept of continuing a road can participate by placing pieces wherever they want.  The goal is to end roads with people wearing your color so you can place your follower/meeple/kid/gamepiece on them.  First one to get rid of all their pieces wins.  Simple.My 3 year old was capable of playing.  He had no strategy whatsoever and didn't really care about winning or losing.  He just wanted to place the roads down and ""make people walk"" on them.  But he managed to finish 2 games, which is a testament to the game's design around simplicity.  All I would recommend is the kid be able to know colors and the concept of turn taking.  With age I'm sure he'll be able to play more legitimately with strategy and that's where I would imagine things will be more fun.  Not to say the game wasn't fun, but games like this are fun because its about how your pieces interact with other people's and how our decisions ultimately lead up to the game's ending, which I'm sure will lead to some great times as soon as my kid is old enough.

Adds needed and useful improvements
","

  This is Z-Man Games 5th official expansion for Carcassonne. The game comes with 12 new land tiles, Abbey tiles for each player, as well as Mayor, Barn, and Wagon maples for each player.This expansion adds 4 new and interesting mechanics to the game:ABBEY. Each player is given an ""Abbey"" tile. It is essentially a monastery tile accept that all 4 sides are walled. This tile can only be placed when their is a ""hole"" in the board, i.e. an empty space surrounded by all 4 sides orthogonally. It matters not what structures are around it, it fills in the space. You can place a follower on it and it is scored the same way as a monastery. It solves the problem of what to do with those annoying empty spots.MAYOR. This is a slightly larger meeple, whose shape has earned him the nickname of Mayor Fattypants. on many websites. It can be placed in a city like any other follower, however, the mayor is equivalent to how many banners are in the city, e.g. if there are 3 banners in the city the mayor is equal to 3 meeples.BARN. This meeple can be placed where 4 field corners meet. Upon placing, all farmers in the adjoining fields are scored immediately. At the end of the game, the barn receives 4 points per completed city that the fields touch.WAGON. This meeple can be placed like any other meeple with the added ability that once the feature is completed, instead of being removed, it can ""roll"" to the next adjacent uncompleted feature.All in all, this expansion adds some useful and neat tricks that help add to the enjoyment of the game.

Interesting game for all
","

  This is a very fun game that is easy to learn the rules and offers different game strategy each time to keep it fresh.  The quality of the game pieces (heavy stock cardboard tiles and wooden meeples) is excellent and I expect it to last many years.  Depending on the age group of your players, you can just follow the rules of the original games or add rules for the rivers and other expansions.  The goal of the game is to maximize your score by figuring out whether to add your meeple on a road, in a city, in a field, etc. while placing the building tiles in different locations to maximize your options.  Check YouTube for the complete rules and watch how the game is played.  Highly recommend this game for yourself or for gifting.

  Looks like I got one of the counterfeit copies.  Inconsistent print quality, irregular meeples, subpar box quality.  Tile backs are much lighter than official game and expansions. If a warehouse deal seems too good to be true it just may be.  Carcassonne is an amazing game but the product I received is garbage.

Great addition to the original game
","

  We love the original Carcassonne, and had wanted to add an expansion, but had no idea where to start.  Under the Big Top was on sale for a great price, so I couldn't resist.  It adds 3 new circus-themed elements.  The acrobats are ok, in my opinion, and the ringmaster meeple can be helpful, but our favorite is definitely the actual big top circus tent itself.  Every time a circus tile comes up, you put one of the tiny animal tiles upside-down underneath, so you don't see its value.  Then, the next time a circus tile comes up, the traveling circus moves to the next tile, and the animal piece is revealed, with points from 1 (ant) to 7 (elephant).  Any meeples on adjacent tiles score however many points are on that animal piece.  It's such a fun element, especially for my kids (4, almost 7, and 10), who are all so excited to see if the high-scoring elephant will be hiding.  This game expansion is great for adults and kids.  Glad it was the first expansion we decided to buy.

Difficult learning curve and scoring takes place mostly at the end of the game
","

  I took out the material and read the rules to my family members, then each of us tried playing, within a 45 min interval everyone began to lose interest. Keep in mind that this games fun level all depends on the type of person you are playing with. My family isn't much numbers oriented so they hate doing the math each time to score, I love math and I genuinely love the placement of the map markers as part of the strategy. So I would recommend this game to players between the age of 15-35 and it really depends on if you are strategic and well versed in Math. If you want a quick game then this isn't for you.

  It's a fun game and can be as competitive and strategic (or not) as you want it to be.A hint: The starting tile has a different background than the other tiles, but it is the same background as the tiles for the river expansion (which is an alternate starting method).  Therefore, we keep the starting tile in the bag with the meeple so that we can find it fast and easy (especially since it's such a generic tile) and just make sure that the river tiles don't get mixed up (but they're pretty easy to separate as there are no other tiles with water).As mentioned, there is both a river expansion and an abbot expansion included in the box.  The river expansion is fun to change things up a bit in the beginning and get things spread out and I haven't used the abbot expansion yet so I cannot speak to how that adds to the game.  The abbot concept, however, seems simple enough and I think will be easy to incorporate when we want to.

  Bought this for my board game loving husband for his birthday. Not going to lie, eyed it for a while as an idea just based on the medieval theme because we are nerds for that stuff, but had no idea about the game at all. Reviews looked fantastic and theme looked up our alley and STILL i worried about how fun a tile game could be. Boy, was I dumb to worry!! Both hubby and i LoVE to play this, we have had it since his bday in May and play it as-is a few times a week without having opened the expansion pieces yet. Our 8 and 11 year old loves to play with us as well! It is a calm, relaxing but fun family game we all get into. It is fun to try and steal others' cities with mulitple meeples and it is great to see each other work together at other times to complete a map with no holes. We just really enjoy this game!

not easily mastered, and unfortunately
","

  Although definitely very similar to classic Carcassonne, the new River Mechanic is quite different, not easily mastered , and unfortunately, not clearly presented in the rules. Well I mean it is explained, but you have to try it a few times to get comfortable with this powerful new method of scoring additional points. I am delight to see that Z-Man Games is maintaining the same excellent quality in the production of the Carcassonne series that was prevalent when Rio Grande Games had the USA publishing rights for it.

  Very easy tile placement game! Players take turns drawing a tile and playing it based on matching sides (roads to roads, fields to fields, etc.)  After placing tiles, players may choose to place a meeple on the tile to claim roads, fields, cities, or various other features. Placing meeples is the means to scoring.I've introduced this game to my younger children (6&7 yrs.), and they enjoy it. They are able to play fairly, but they don't apply much strategy when placing meeples. It's a fun matching game they can play with the adults.I like to play using a house rule where players draw three tiles, then have a choice which tile they choose to play on their turn. It provides opportunity for a bit more strategy.There are lots of expansions that change the game up providing a huge replay factor. This will one day be a classic like Monopoly. There should be a copy in every home, in my opinion.Happy gaming!

Yay for the Abbey!  Yay for the Tiles!  Meh for the Mayor
","

  The Abbey is a fun addition.  You can fill in a hole in the board with an Abbey, finishing off the surrounding features and scoring the Abbey like a cloister.  You get one Abbey for the entire game.  The interesting strategies that come from this are significant enough that I include the Abbey in most games now...which is why I'm going to give this expansion 4 stars.  Even though that's a small part of this expansion, it was worth it to me.Possibly the best part about this expansion, though, are the new tiles.  While they don't quite match the other tiles I have (the color saturation is noticeably off, which was probably a printing error), the tiles are interesting and new, including a tile that has two shields on it!  Other fun tiles include a city-ender with a shield, additional weird city-over-city tiles (see picture; it's hard to describe), and a roundabout road that turns your road into three continuous prongs and make for absurdly long roads and fun competition over Inns (if combining this with the Inns & Cathedrals expansion).  I'm really into diversity of tiles, so that bops this expansion right up to 5 stars for me.  I'm including a picture of most of the landscape tiles so that anyone else interested in diverse tiles can see what I mean.The wagons are interesting, too.  You can use a wagon to claim a feature like a meeple, and once that feature finishes, the wagon can be moved to an adjacent, unclaimed feature.  A simple, but sometimes fun mechanism.That said, I just didn't get into the Mayor or the barns, which create city and farm complications, respectively.  (I'll let other reviewers explain these mechanisms, so that you can decide for yourself on these.)

  A FB friend suggested this for our 7-year-old who had just learned (and beat me on) Catan. Yeah, this is totally different but still a great strategy game, a little less involved than Catan. Game play in 75-90 minutes with 3 players. We have not added the rivers yet but are planning to next time. I love how you can use different strategies to win: Get small points quickly and easily, or claim the farms and wait until the end, or anywhere in between. I have recently learned the art of sneaking in on someone else's city, farm, or road. It's truly and art, and truly fun when they realize that they can't always stop you. One of my top 5 favorite games.

  This is my new favorite game.  I would literally play it over and over again if people would play with me.  My husband and I have a whole cabinet full of games, but this is the one we *actually* use on a regular basis.  It‚Äôs just the right balance of strategy and luck.  Everyone we‚Äôve played it with has enjoyed it.  From gamers to casual party game players it seems to please everyone.When our young kids want to play we just eliminate ‚Äúfarmlands‚Äù and allow them to place meeples even if something is already controlled.  This makes a much simpler version of the game.  They are 4 and 5 and enjoy it with these modifications.This set comes with expansions so just when you feel like it‚Äôs getting repetitive you can try out a new addition.  I have loved Carcassone since I first played it several years ago and I‚Äôm glad we actually own it now!

The rules are simple, the play is fast paced, there is strategy involved, but also randomness can play into it.  It's fun for children, too!  I have a family of 5, and this is the prefect 5 player game.  Games take about 30-40 minutes to play, so even kids can stay engaged.Because the game is built as players draw and place tiles, there is great replay value: you always get a new game, every time!Tiles are varied and the art is wonderful, too.I haven't played the Abbott add-on yet, but I'm sure it will add more value, variety and strategy as we play it more and more.

  One of the criteria for great family games is how easy they are to teach. This game has been around for so long but I ignored it for too long. I finally got it and I am upset at how much fun I've been missing on. I taught this game to my family. including an 8 year old, in only a few minutes. It is also a great introduction into other games. I already have a lineup of games to bring to the table after a few more plays of this. My only tip is that you play on a large surface because you never know where the tiles will end up. The first time we played on a small table and felt constricted by the space but we learned our lesson. Get this game!

  Honestly I don't know what more I can say about this best-selling game that hasn't been said already. If you're on the fence and looking at new reviews on Amazon allow me to say this in an effort to sway you:If you like board games, you'll like Carcassonne. It's as simple as that.I'd even go as far as to say that this could be a game that gets people into playing board games.It's simple. Strategic, but not overly heady. It looks nice. It's fun to place the tiles. There's a ton of expansions to advance the strategies and complexities... but even the base game has a good amount of underlying strategy that makes it really fun to be competitive over if that's your preference.If you're like me - you'll end up getting the game.

Bad quality,  possibly counterfeit- Mpp sent better replacement
","

  Was introduced to this game through my brother. he had the big box expansion but I ended up getting this version for now.  however the quality doesn't seem to be as good as his.  you can see some of the meeple pieces are weird shapes and on the back of the land tiles some are lighter and some are a little darker (They are much lighter than they actually should be which became an issue as noted in my update below)  they were also hard to punch out of the sheets and had to be done carefully to avoid ripping the backs.  Also  I guess this version doesn't come with the 50/100 tile point markers so it's a little hard to keep track of points.  I believe they come in the inns and chapel expansion. I was expecting better quality...Update: so we bough the princess & dragon expansion.  As you can see the quality of the printing on that set is better and the backs of the tiles aren't even close in color...  We can clearly tell what were going to be drawing next which spoils the game a little.  I would call this base set product defective and will be seeking to return it for one of better quality.  We are now thinking it may even be a fake. Changed original review from 4 to 3 stars for these reasonsUpdate 2: so I emailed the seller MMP Living and they agreed the quality isn't up to par and sent a replacement- The customer service was very prompt in responding. These items ship from amazons warehouse so there was no way for them to check the quality before shipping, however he said to keep him posted.Update 3: OK- last update. So we got our replacement from MPP living and the quality looks better. The back of the tiles are almost identical to the expansion- the meeple look better. Very pleased with mpp livings customer service. Since they took responsibility for the defective product and sent me a new one and no extra charge and told me to keep the old one. I will change my review back to a 4 (not a 5 because of the mess but the customer service really was great) My sister In law was looking more into bad quality bored games, and its not uncommon when they are made over seas, for the night shift to take defective product and re-sell it for profit. She thinks that's what happened here.

  We have been enjoying Carcassonne and were ready for an expansion.  This one makes the game even more fun.  One of the things I like the best about this expansion is the little bag that comes with it and holds all of the tiles.  It just makes the game easier and more efficient.  We find the game to be more interesting and more competitive with this expansion.My favorite part of this expansion is the builder.  If you place your builder properly, you can change your game dramatically.  But, if you place it the wrong way, then you end up being frustrated!  The builder makes the game so much fun.Not as excited about the 'goods' aspect of it, but it does add a nice little twist to this fun game!

  This is a fun game, and I've taught it to quite a few adults. The only person who struggled with this game, said she had a hard time visually matching the features.The only complaint I have is over the monasteries...if one player gets (by chance) all the monasteries, he/she will undoubtedly win the most points...especially if every monastery tile gets placed one next to the other. So you can double-up on points in the surrounding completed tiles. I have suggested that we make an impromptu ""rule"" that monasteries must be at least 2 tiles apart...but this has been a problem if there are too few potential placement possibilities.

  The recent German editions and the recent US editions are not exactly the same.  There are color differences in the grass ('farm' areas) and the spires on the buildings in the cities, and so on.  So if you are going to mix two sets together, or buy add-on sets, stick to either the German or the US, unless this would not be a problem for you.  My BF and I prefer the US edition: the grass is a darker hue and looks better, in our opinion.The original German edition (which does not include the River or the Abbot) are different from both of these.

Also great is the fact that if it starts to get stale there are many different expansion sets that we could get to freshen things up.

  Fun, easy game to pick up with no set up time. It plays best with two. Requires a table to play. Our coffee table couldn't contain it at times. It gets a lot of play but am lowering to 4 stars. Why? After many plays and memorizing the tiles it feels volatile like poker. Kind of 50/50. Over multiple games the better player should emerge but it's just too darn random for my liking. It becomes a game of betting over a shared probability puzzle. Adding a hand of tiles dampens this some but reduces tension and allows players to stray from blocking. Not a bad game and easy to tweak. The Traders and Builder expansion is pretty good to expand the game and we play with it often but in the end it's just more Carcassonne. I'm happily keeping it but it falls between the trebel and bullseye.

  There are different degrees/tiers of play. When we were first introduced to Carcassonne, our friends had added one or two enhancements. We found the game difficult.

  I bought this without buying the first expansion, and it incorporates to the base game flawlessly. It adds many more tiles, builder meeples, and pig meeples. Builders let you take a second turn if you add onto a road or city your builder is on. Pigs increase the score of farmland you own. This is good, because farmland is how you win. That is the secret.Oddly, it included pink pieces... which the base game doesn't have. Maybe the first expansion comes with pink meeples to increase the player count? I'm not sure.

  This game is awesome and truly does teach strategy and thinking a few steps out. As an adult I really enjoy teaching my 3 YO the thought process behind where to put the tiles. It is a bit advanced for her but she will definitely grow to understand how to play strategically. I had to youtube how to play this Bc the instructions weren‚Äôt super clear. I even played a round incorrectly and then midway through We realized we had to have two dead ends in order to put a pawn down.

Love the game...feel I paid too much...should have bought the cheaper one
","

  The reviews are misleading...I was expecting 13x13 board which I did not get.  The one I received has a board that is almost 12x12...actual playing area is 11x11.  The board is grey and comes with zip bags to separate the colors into.  If the zip bags and slightly bigger board are the only difference I don't see what makes it deluxe.  Wish I had gone with the cheaper one.  I guess I paid $10 extra for cheap zip bags.  I ordered the one that says Deluxe Blockus Game sold by Amazon and fulfilled by Amazon.  If I was giving stars only on the game itself it would have been 5...we love this game.  It's only the confusing descriptions and reviews that made me rate it a 4.

Great game; verify package size to confirm gameboard size

  This review is for the 13""x13"" product.  Reviews for this product and the 10""x10"" product seem to overlap/be mixed up.  I wanted to make sure I bought the larger size format.  For anyone else in the same boat, I had success by verifying the size of the item in the description section.  The box size neatly correlates to the game board size.  If the box is listed as 10""x10"", a 13""x13"" game board does not lie within!As other reviewers have noted, this is an excellent game.  It was new to me and my 6-yr-old and we both learned it quickly. There are layers and layers of strategy, and it teaches so many skills related to visual/spatial acuity, math, and strategy, all within a really enjoyable game. I definitely recommend it. It's engaging for kids and parents alike in this household.

Fun game but warped game tile
","

  Bought this as a gift for my neighbor. We played it together and found one of the blue pieces is warped and does not sit flush against the board. We tried to gently bend it but ended up snapping it in the process. We super glued it for her as a temporary fix.I don‚Äôt really want to ask for the gift back in order to exchange it so I am trying to figure out how to replace just the broken piece. I could order the $4.00 bag of blue replacement tiles from the manufacturer‚Äôs website but 1) I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay more just it came this way and 2) I don‚Äôt know if the blokus ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù pieces are the same size as the standard.What a pain.Update: I ended up buying a second game so I could swap out the tile with my neighbor and then  I just kept the game with the broken tile. I‚Äôm glad that I did not order the $4 piece bag from the manufacturer. I visited another family over Thanksgiving and saw they had the original, non-deluxe version that is available in store. Holy smokes, that board is tiny! The pieces are tiny! I wish I could have done a by side photo, the replacement tiles would not have fit at all.So, in the end we kept the game with the defective piece. We think of our friends every time we see it even though they moved away. Having now seen the original version, I would NEVER buy it or recommend that anyone else buy it. It is microscopic in comparison and would only be good if you are an ant. Buy this deluxe model, check all the tiles, and you‚Äôll be good to go.

Tiles slide all over the place, making this difficult for little kids
","

  I was expecting the nice version of this game that my son had at his preschool. Unfortunately, this is a much more cheaply made version, where there are almost no ridges for the tiles to sit in, so the tiles end up sliding around very easily. Super-frustrating for little kids who are still working on their motor skills. I would not have bought this if I'd realized this would happen.

Great game for families to play!

  I went on a hunt to find age/family appropriate games. My children are 13 and 11 and we like to play games, especially those that have an ""even"" playing field (vs trivia, etc.). The reviews were good for this and I'm so glad I bought it! We were able to open, read the instructions and start playing quickly (I can't stand when you have to consult the directions a ton of times because people are confused). It starts out simple enough but towards the end, we all realized how much more strategy we should have used from the beginning! The second match was much more interesting once we ""got"" it.My son even played it the next day by himself, trying to place as many of the pieces as he could on the board.

Where has this game been all my life?!
","

  I have watched bloggers and instagram influencers rave about this game.  I didn't really think we would love it that much, and wasn't excited about dropping $25.00 on a game, but then Covid happened and we needed some new games.  So I took the plunge.  With that being said, it's a REAL HIT!!  It gets used at least 5 days a week currently and we can play for up to two hours in a sitting.  The games are pretty quick, so in that two hour time span, we can average 4-7 games.  Our son is 15 and our daughter is 9, both of them highly enjoy this game, as well as my husband and I.  The rules and instructions were super simple and basic.  By our second time playing we felt like pros.  I'm not sure where this game has been all of my life!  Super fun, and really gets your brain thinking constantly to you next moves.I do think that $25.00 is a bit much price wise.  $15.00-20.00 seems more realistic, but considering how much playing time it is getting, I'll chalk it up as a win.The plastic pieces are great quality.  I do worry that the grey playing board will eventually crack, so we are just being careful with it.  Also the box seems a little on the flimsy side.  Minor yes, but once a game box is ruined that's bothersome to me.  So we will treat this with extra care.Aside from me thinking the price is a little high, and the flimsy box, I would not hesitate to gift this game to our family friend to enjoy as well!

An adequate version of this game.
","

  The board in this set measures 11 3/4 inches square, not the promised 13 inches square.  The board does have the full 400 squares.  The pieces are less substantial and a bit smaller than in the original version, although I wouldn't call them fragile.  There are 21 pieces of each color, as their should be.  So this may not be the version, physically, you are thinking about if you have played this game somewhere else.  However, this is still the same fun game to enjoy with friends or family.  Keep in mind that Blokus really is a game for four players.

  We bought the game because we had fun playing it with friends. The game itself is great! I highly recommend it. What I am not happy about is that Amazon affixed the three shipping labels directly to the game box and just taped the game box shut (not even any plastic wrap between the stickers and the box). After a few aggravating moments I was able to peel the shipping stickers off, but now I have sticky residue all over the box.

  Our 5-year old can play it but it's also lots (more?) fun for us adults! The only issue we have with it that it is for four people. If you play it with three people then you have to take turns (across rounds) in playing the fourth player. The person who is in between the two other real players has therefore a disadvantage! So unfortunately, we have stopped playing it. Bummer!

... Deluxe Blokus Game for my family and we absolutely love it. This game can be played by everyone
","

  I bought Deluxe Blokus Game for my family and we absolutely love it.  This game can be played by everyone.The game is played on a square board divided into 20 rows and 20 columns, for a total of 400 squares. There are a total of 84 game tiles, organized into 21 shapes in each of four colors: blue, yellow, red and green.  The game tiles have 1 to 5 made up of different shapes.  The idea of the game is to strategically place these odd shaped tiles on the board and try to get rid of as many pieces as you possibly can.  In order to put down a tile it needs to touch the corner of the same colored tile that you are playing.  You can play this game with 2 to 4 people.  Each person getting the same amount of tiles and each person is represented by a color.  Once you cannot play any more of your tiles you are out of the game.  The individual with the least amount of tiles in their hands wins.  It is a game that can be played on many different levels even up to the highest of strategies.  I would recommend this game to anybody who is looking to find a fun family friendly game.

  Blockus is a classic game, but after the initial release, Hasbro sold a smaller version that was just annoying. For many years I felt I couldn't gift this game to anyone because it was too small and that made playing it difficult.Finally, after years of waiting, they've re-released the bigger version. It's still not ""quite"" as big as the original, but it's close enough for me to feel comfortable buying again. My girlfriend was overjoyed when this showed up on her doorstep!

Blokus helps kids be smart
","

  I am an instructor for the Summer Institute for the Gifted and at SIG I teach game strategy to 5-6 year old gifted children.  One of the games I use in this course is Blokus.  I highly recommend Blokus to any parent who wants to help their 5-7 year old have fun learning to be smart.The beauty of Blokus is that the rules are incredibly simple so a young child can learn them quickly, in under two minutes, and yet the strategy and thinking levels needed to get increasingly better at this game are quite complex.  This combination is exactly what makes a great game to teach critical thinking skills to young children.  Specifically, Blokus helps children develop spacial reasoning abilities, problem solving and perseverance.  It also can begin to develop thinking ahead skills.  But, this game is as hard as your child is ready for in that a child can play it and have fun before these capabilities are fully developed and have a blast while improving these skills and as their skills increase they can engage the game at higher degrees of complex thought.  With repeated play, you will see your child's thinking skills improve.My oldest daughter just turned five and we gave this to her for her birthday yesterday.  We have already played four times.  She loves it and we love seeing her work through the spatial constraints and opportunities the board gives you each turn.  You will hit a homerun if you give Blokus to your child as a gift both as a fun parent and a parent who helps to raise a smart child.

Fun For the Whole Family

  I bought this game along with a batch of other games for the holidays to have for family and friends to play after meals and by far, it was the one that received the most play time over Thanksgiving.  I wanted to have games that had quick rounds (~20-30 minutes) so that everyone could play and rules that were easy to learn and explain.  It's a great little game to have on your shelf as it's easy to jump in and play and easy for players of all ages to enjoy.While the concepts seem simple at first blush, the great thing about Blokus is that there's really no one right way or one right strategy to winning the game and everyone has a chance to win a round because of the dynamic nature of the game.My wife and I bust it out and play two-player rounds by the fire once in a while as well.If you like this type of game, I'd also recommend Rumis which is very similar to this game by plays in 3-dimensions instead of 2.  It's another great game that's easy for players of all ages to jump into and play.

Simple yet intriguing!
","

  I purchased this for my family for Christmas after reading all the positive reviews and awards it has won.  I wondered how anything this seemingly simple could be fun and hold the interest of kids who are conditioned to instant excitment from video games and adults whose choice of toys are electronic devices of some sort.  Let me first say that this is not one of those games where everyone will be chomping at the bit to open up and play after unwrapping it at Christmas time.  The game is basically a gray plastic box with a grid and various plastic shapes grouped into 4 different colors, similiar to Tetris pieces that you place on the grid.  Nothing fancy to look at and kids will probably push this present aside until all the other ""flashy"" toys are opened and played with.  But once they do, everyone will enjoy this very engaging, thought provoking, challenging, and addicting game and will want to play it time and time again.  It's rare to find such an intellectual game where all ages can compete.  The box says 5 to adult but to really appreciate the strategic content of the game, I would say that 8 to adult is more accurate.  It can be played as one game which takes about 15-20 min where the idea is to get rid of all or most of your pieces.  The ones left over are tallied with the player with the fewest points being the winner. Or you can play a set of games where points are tallied from each game and a winner is decided.  You place your shapes on the grid one at a time where they must touch another one of your pieces diagonally.  Play is then based on alternate pieces placed by each player..max 4 players.  Super fun, as challenging as the opponents are capable of, and a great framily game.

  I absolutely love this game! My oldest son is 7 1/2 and I am so glad that the days of candy land and cootie are gone and the days of blockus are here!!!!! This game is so much fun to play.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it had so many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  I was not disapointed.  The whole family likes it, but grandma, mom, and 7 yr old are completely hooked.  The strategy is addictive. I see the puzzle shapes in my sleep:) The more you play, the more strategy you pick up, but you don't even realize that until you've been playing for a while. I ordered qwirkle at the same time and we much prefer blockus! I especially like that it is basically self scoring. unlike quirkle, where you have to add up keep a running tally of your points.  Blockus is much easier for my 7 yr old to play with a friend or brother without adult assistance.The only negative I have is that the best way to play is with 4 players.  You CAN play with 2,or 3, but then the players have to double up and be in charge of 2 colors.  I would not let this keep you from getting the game, but just something to consider.

  The games itself is fun and challenging especially for a geometry challenged person like myself. The game box looked like it was used. The corners and edges of the box were slightly worn and there were tape marks on the edge of the box. With that being said I really wanted the original version of the game...the one before the company ""updated"" the playing board. Previous reviewers noted how the original version had a larger playing surface and that is what I wanted. All the game pieces were their and in good shape so I didn't feel a need to return it. My 16 year old who is not a geometry person either won the game the first time she played it...her challengers had all played it several times already. She is a visual person which helped her in this game. It is a great and unique addition to our game library.

  We love Blokus! I bought it while looking for games that would be educational. This game requires strategy to win but you can play with younger kids no problem. Unusually play it with my 10 and 6 year old. It is hardest to play with 4 people because it gets harder and harder to find spots for your pieces. With the three of us we could usually get all our pieces down. With the two kids playing on their own, much easier.I grew up playing games like Tetris, dr. Mario, bejeweled etc so I always look forward to Blokus. You don't put the pieces together like Tetris but it requires strategy in fitting all your pieces on the board.I like that it doesn't take that long to play a round and it is not too involved. Once you learn the rules you can quickly start having fun .

  We opened this early Christmas eve when we and the visitors - adult daughter and her friend  - were at the point when everyone had run out of news and other things to occupy the time.  We all needed a diversion.  Boy did this game fit the bill!  We are in our 60s, and my daughter and friend in their 20-30s, but it was a game all ages could really get into.  I suspect it would well down to early teen or younger.  All through the game my daughter's friend kept exclaiming, ""We're getting this as soon as we get home!""  Every free moment for the rest of this visit was involved in playing Blokus.  My daughter and her friend were so enthusiastic we finally offered to let them take the game home since it was clear they'd be inviting everyone over to it.  High points are that games are short enough, even with 4 players, that no one get's bored (maybe 20 minutes or so with 4 playing), nor stuck playing a game they need to or want to leave.  You can play nicely with 2, 3 or 4 people, though I think 4 likely works best.  But beware ""mature"" folks - your kids can likely beat the pants off you!

  From reading the description of this game online I was a little confused what they meant by only allowing pieces to touch at the corners because it wasn't readily apparent to me that most of the pieces consist of multiple joined squares in various configurations (think tetrus). Having said that, once you see the game the rules are quite simple and can be learned in a few minutes. Adults can play a challenging game, but 2 adults can readily play with 2 kids because the adults will focus on blocking each other in and hence the [ignored] kids could well end up winning. Best with 4 players, but 2 works pretty well too.Caveats: the playing pieces are bit flimsy, so kids who aren't careful could break some pieces, but replacement pieces are easily (and cheaply) available. Also, the scoring rules are a bit more complex than the playing rules, so when we play with kids we just say whoever is the last one able to make a move is the winner (and 2nd last one gets 2nd place, etc).

Fun game to play for 4 people
","

  This is a fun family game that needs 3-4 people to play.  I strongly recommend 4 people, as any less makes it too easy for everyone to win (thus having two+ winners at the end of the game).The object of this game is to get rid of all your colored tiles.  If you have any tiles left over at the end of the game, you count up the blocks, and that's your score.  The person with the lowest score wins.You can play this game with kids, wives, and buddies.  This game does not demand too much attention, so you can casually talk while playing this game too.  The game is strategic though, and also very addictive.  When you finish one game, you'll all want to play it ""one more time"", then ""one more time"" again.I bought this game for $30 in the local mall, but it's nice to see Amazon will delivery it with FREE SHIPPING for even less money (AND NO TAX).  I strongly recommend this game.  You'll definately look at it and say ""I bet it took $1 to make this game"", but the game is so much fun to play.  My family asks that I bring this game every time we have a game night.

Game Box Damaged

  I thought there would be some type of protection for this Game, like celophane, et al.  Both of the gift packages were damaged.  This was the first time I had opted for no box.  I will never do that again.  Both of the receivers had to scrap off the sticky shipping labels.  Really tacky shipping option.  Not a good PR move.  I was very disappointed.J. Miller

Great family game
","

  We played this game with adults and children as young as 6.  Everyone enjoyed it!  The kids may or may not fully grasp the strategic aspects of the game, but they can understand the simple rules and have fun playing it.  As an adult, I enjoyed playing a game with children that was also challenging for me.  (I don't like the typical kiddie board games.)  The game can be played in 20-30 minutes, so it's great for those who don't like long involved games, and people with shorter attention spans.  Highly recommend for both adult game enthusiasts and for playing as a family.

Fun for the whole family
","

  This is a fun and interesting puzzle game. I normally play with my two sons (5 and 8). The game is trivially easy to pick up and play even for children. The scoring rules are simple.This is definitely a challenging game due to the complex interactions between colors on the board. However, I found that even my children were able to grasp the basic strategies of leaving their options open for later in the game, blocking other players, and saving the little pieces for last when the board is so full you can't place the big pieces anywhere.I read the reviews before I bought it, and one person recommended shrinking the board by one square on each side for a three-player game and two squares all around for a two-player game. The board is clearly balanced for four players, but that idea works well enough.

our 4th set!
","

  This is a great game for the family, but after playing it two or three times, my family (8yr old girl, 12 yr old boy, husband and I) no longer play it.  Our 6 yr old, who is autistic, loves it though.  It's a great game for learning strategy, playing with shapes, and it's so versatile.  You should check out the ways people use this game on YouTube...from tetris-like (without the disappearing lines if you're playing it real-time), to making stories, to battling etc.  My 6 yr old is now on his 4th set because he kept losing pieces on the others (because he brings it with him everywhere - beach, restaurant, airplane rides, concerts, etc.  I do wish they only sold the pieces to replace missing ones, but they don't.

Blokus Makes You Lose Friends
","

  As one of my friends says ""Blokus makes you lose friends."" Our games can get pretty intense and stressful, which is all part of the fun! Or maybe it was the beer talking. Yes, we can turn any game into a drinking game.The game has simple rules, is easy to pick up, and actually involves strategy and THINKING! That's why it's MENSA approved. You can have fun and feel like a smarty pants at the same time! I especially like that each game takes less than 30 minutes so the game never feels tedious. If there was a negative, I think it would be that the game plays best with 4 people and isn't quite the same with 2 or 3.The board and pieces seem pretty durable and are sure to provide years of entertainment. Whether you're 13 or nearly 30, like we are, Blokus is a good time all around.

Fun Family Activity
","

  We decided to take our daughters (ages 10 and 11) to a real escape room for Mother's Day this year. We wanted to give them a little practice first, so we got this game. Our girls enjoyed the Jumanji movie, so it looked like a fun theme. This game was outstanding! This set comes with 3 different adventures with a battery operated box that counts down your time, plays jungle sounds while you play, and alerts you if you enter the correct answers to move on or not. It starts with a small 15 minute introduction game to get you used to have to solve puzzles in a time limit. These were easy enough for my 10 & 11 year olds to mostly do on their own. They got the hang of it pretty quickly and wanted to jump right in to the next adventure! The other 2 included adventures are both full 60 minute games. These adventures follow the storyline of the newer Jumanji movie where you get sucked into a video game and have to find your way out. The next adventure was not as easy. It was quite doable but we did get hung up in a few places. All in all, I recommend this for a family game night. You can reprint all the papers you write on throughout the game from their website, so I did and repackaged it up for a friend to borrow and do with their family. Great feature from this set so it is reusable to share. One con is that if you use the box to time yourself, every time you put in a wrong answer, it takes away a minute from your countdown. That does not happen in real escape rooms. So we lost a few minutes that way and only finished with 37 seconds to go! I would prefer it not take away time. I recommend using your own timer also so you can accurately see what your real time would have been, but the box is needed to check your answers and sets some ambiance with the jungle noises as well. Otherwise, I found this to be put together nicely, has cute puzzles that even kids can help with and enjoy, and follows the Jumanji theme very closely.

This version of the game CANNOT be used with expansion packs.

  This game itself was fun but it was not clear that the included game pieces would not enable playing of expansion packs. I purchased this expecting that the Chrono Decoder and keys would be the same as the original version of the game, but this version only includes 8 keys (versus the original version that includes 16). We got over halfway through the Funland expansion and then spent 20 minutes trying to resolve a correct answer because we only had half as many keys as we needed (so were missing a key to proceed to part 3). Very frustrating and disappointing experience. Why not just include the additional 8 keys to make this functional for expansion packs?

  I purchased this game partly because of the movie. I seen in a lot of other reviews that they said that the game was falling apart ours did not. Though the middle part is really cheaply made plastic if you were to accidentally put your weight on it it would break without a second thought. You have to take the card and slip it under the reader to be able to read what is on the cards some people may have difficulty reading it. With three of us playing in less than an hour we were completely done with the game. We did have some fun though. It's now in the closet and we may never play it again, may just have been a waste of money.

Made me feel like a big dummy
","

  I bought four of these (was I crazy?!) to use at my daughter's ninth birthday party so the girls could play in teams of 4. She loves the Jumanji movies and was so excited to try this out. Things might have worked if there were enough parents around to guide them. Definitely not for 9-year-olds to complete alone as the directions were confusing (they were meant to be to make it challenging). The timing factor made things stressful for them and cooperating in a group of four was just about impossible. And these are really smart (and maybe a little bossy) girls.  I had one leftover game we didn't use at the party so we tried it today. It wasn't impossible, but it took us way more than an hour. And though the timer continues to count if you go beyond the hour time limit, the machine shut off by itself in the middle of a clue so we couldn't check our answers. You can't run through the game ahead of time to be sure this would work for a group of kids since you'd then be tearing apart items and writing on the papers so it really is a one-time use game. And I admit, there were times we had three of the keys down pat, couldn't figure out the fourth, so we just kept guessing until the controller dinged that we had gotten the combination right.  Honestly, my daughter would not stop talking and making guesses during the whole thing that I couldn't concentrate properly! Lol! She was eager to try and didn't give up easily, but it was stressful even with just two of us working on it. I gave up after the fourth task and put my husband in charge of working the rest out with her. She kept at it and enjoyed it....even after 90 minutes.  Older kids might enjoy it, but even they might need a parent's help.

  Fluxx is my FAVORITE game. I have original Fluxx, Doctor Who Fluxx, and now Jumanji Fluxx. Jumanji Fluxx has the most durable cardboard box. It's beautiful. It makes a great gift for anyone who loves Jumanji and has time to play games. The biggest difference between the other Fluxx games I have and Jumanji Fluxx is that (because you get 3 lives in the Jumanji game) you can get eliminated and have to start over. (This also makes it easy for anyone to jump into a game at any time.) It adds an intriguing twist to Fluxx that I love. We will definitely enjoy playing this for years to come. I'm just wondering if they're going to create a Jumanji 2 expansion pack, now that Jumanji: The Next Level is out, because I would totally buy it.

Great variation of Fluxx

  I was very pleasantly surprised by how well this game balances still being Fluxx but also fitting with the Jumanji theme.This game is clearly still Fluxx (same general principles and gameplay), but it has a few variations that make it interesting (the danger cards and meta rules, plus labeling some keepers as adventurers or animals).As with other versions of Fluxx, it's playable pretty much by anyone who can read. I play most often with my nieces and nephews 9+.One thing to know is that with the danger cards, players can be ""eliminated"" which is kind of like dying or getting ""out."" Some kids might get upset about losing all their cards, but at least until you get through the first draw pile, players come back after one full round, so they don't necessarily lose when they get eliminated.

  Game came in less time then what was stated in shipping so that is always nice. I have only played a few of the Fluxx games and have enjoyed them. It is very chaotic at times due to the rules changing but easy to figure out if you read the cards. The Jumanji version has an a few extra twists like players being eliminated. But there are rules for jumping back in so no one is left out for long. Unless a rule is played to counter that.

  This is a larger game box, however it contains large amounts of space. The board inside folds into a square just like the cheap version from target.

great educational and character building game
","

  okay, hear me out. I know that the title makes it sound heavy but the premise of the game is that you can ""knock"" other players off the board and take their spot if you draw a certain card. Can anyone see how this might upset a 7 or 5 year old? I have one of each and we play weekly. They have come to understand that 'what goes around, comes around' and have developed each week a better attitude toward the times when they are 'down' as opposed to 'up.' They have also learned to be graceful towards a bad temporary outcome. Basic math is necessary and I have seen my 5 year old's counting improve since we started playing. I was really happy to see them enjoy the game and pleasantly surprised to see the character building value of the game. About the 4th time we played they stopped just trying to get each other back and started to think more strategically. Thanks Hasbro (please don't turn this into a movie)

A wonderful game
","

  I teach English as a Second Language, and I'm always looking for fun things to do with my students. My group this year is in high school. This is a wonderful teaching tool on several levels. First of all, I use dice instead of the cards that are included, and I make the kids count out loud as they play, so that it teaches counting.  Second of all, it's a great way to encourage social interaction. Because the idea is to land on someone else's token, the kids have to interact. My students have different native languages, and when they play this game, they don't need to speak each other's languages to have fun. As they become more proficient in English, they can also interact better verbally. Plus, the nature of the game is that it's so spontaneous and fun that they don't worry as much about mistakes as they do during structured class time. This is a great activity for Friday class periods when nobody wants to work much anyway, and they don't realize that their teacher is making them practice English. :-)

  Our family enjoys this game.  My youngest who can play is 5.5.  The cards must be read so he needs help with that part.  The game is about ""sweet revenge"" so there is a lot of attacking your enemy which means kids need to be able to handle that in a good way.  My 5-yr-old struggles with this.  We are working on it but we may decide he's too young for now.  It's very fun for older kids/adults.  Our only problem: the instructions were only in Spanish!

A Classic Board Game
","

  Sorry is a classic game that's been around for a while.  It's good for modeling patience, stategy, and frustration control!  I have used it a lot when working with kids.  It's not too complicated for kids.  It's basically a simple race around the board.  The strategy and frustration come in because you have opportunities to make other players go back to start, trade places with you, and things like that. What a lot of people don't seem to realize is, there are two sets of rules.  The way most people play, you pick a card up on each turn and do whatever it says.  There is strategy because you have a choice of which piece to move.  In the more advanced play you deal out 5 cards to each player so you have a choice of which card to play as well as which piece to move!  After playing a card you then pick the top card from the stack to replace it so you always have 5 cards.  It's one of my favorites, even though I must have played it a hundred times, and all the kids have loved it too!

Sorry! board game

  This is a fun game. It seems simple, the kid learns to play it fast, but it encourages thinking, planning, and strategy. It is also a great fun. My 7-year-old son enjoys it very much. Up to four players can play at a time, taking turns, so it's usually my son, me, my wife, and our cat. The good thing is that our son does not seem to be upset if he loses, as there is a lot of fun and ultimately luck that plays a big role, so you can be winning or losing until the last minute - therefore fun and intrigue are maintained until the last minute, while with other games it is clear who wins early in the game, and fun is lost.The only downside is that the rules that come with the game are a little difficult to understand, there are some ambiguous instructions, but as you start playing, you figure that out using common sense.

  I was able to get a copy of this game around Black Friday in 2019 for a good price. Shortly after, from what I remember, it was either sold out or the price was heavily inflated. I tend to wait for games to be more than 40% before purchasing, but I just had this feeling that this game would be worth it. And I was right.REWIND: Ever since I was young I loved playing board games even though I was an only child and I spent hours playing Sorry!, Jumanji, chess, Chinese checkers, Monopoly, etc. all by myself (I would call it research now). And the year culminated at Christmastime when my cousins would all come together and we would play board games together.FAST FORWARD: I played more computer games as I got older and then games on iOS. I found Ticket to Ride or Scotland Yard on iOS and I thought those games were great! Little did I know there were PHYSICAL board games of these games, until my neighborhood friend said he played Ticket to Ride too and brought over the real copy and my mind was blown away.I started sneaking into the toy section at Target and found Pandemic. I acquired some expansions on Amazon and that's where I was for 7 years. I played other games in the mean time but I didn't care to own them, because my friends owned them. I moved out of the country and was busy with school. I graduated and came back and low and behold it was Black Friday!I had to do research for prices for Black Friday and I stumbled on Ars Technica that mentioned Wingspan. I didn't care for birds...but the box was pretty...and what? All the cards had different art on them? That's what sold me.FAST FORWARD again! And here we are 6 months later down a rabbit hole with 80+ games, several game groups (mostly online now due to social distancing), and family who are stuck at home and have no other choice but to play games with me :) I also enjoy birding now and recognize the local birds. A silver lining with Covid is that it is during the Spring so I am able to see multiple different bird species flying around in my suburban backyard which fuels my newfound birding hobby.Pros:1. Wingspan is pretty to look at. Nothing ugly. Even the boring American crow starts to look pretty because it feeds the other birds in your bird ""engine"" - which is a combination of cards with birds on them that add on powers and help you on your way to victory.2. Even if I lose, I don't mind it because I enjoyed playing.3. It's fun to read the little info tidbit and learn something new on every single card.4. Information is from reputable sources.5. The game is pretty.6. It is relaxing...and at the same time NOT because there are so many possible combinations that could happen your brain cog wheels are always spinning. Or at least mine are.7. It has a solo mode.8. There is a Swift-Start pack - which are separate instruction mats for players with instructions to help everyone as a group learn how to play the game. This is a helpful tool for people who have no idea what they're doing or you want to teach this game to other people.Cons:1. This could potentially lead you to hobbies like board gaming or birding2. If you're a completionist/OCD and you buy this game, know that you're in for at least 5 more expansions3. If you love artsy craftsy stuff and find the fan-made things on Etsy...you might spend more money than what you thought you were going to spend4. The bird feeder dice tower is a cool gimmick. I say gimmick, because I let my dumb 12-year-old cousin put it together and it was frayed before I even played the game for the first time. However, my husband bought me a proper bird house dicetower from Etsy...and after you have one of those, why would you ever go back to that cardboard thing?5. The game tray. It's flimsy plastic...it looks nice...but when you start to plan on sleeving your cards (which I did after I had to hold back from saying anything while tearfully watching Frito fingers manhandle my cards) you end up spending a lot of time trying to figure out which sleeves to buy and if all the cards will fit in the tray...or do you buy a new tray...and the cycle continues.  Apparently these cards are American standard card size, because there is a European standard card size.  I got the cheapest Mayday sleeves which are also the thinnest, so all the cards still fit in the trays. BUT they feel so thin...and plasticky...They aren't like the NICE sleeves my husband got for Terraforming Mars. ROLL EYES. The cards from Terraforming Mars are wearing out though on the edges and the Wingspan cards are way nicer in quality.SO good luck to you if you choose this dark path toward pretty birds and board game nights.Seriously though, if you think you might like a pretty card game about pretty birds that isn't cartoony and has real information you can learn from, try out Wingspan!

Poor instructions and way too complex
","

  I bought this for my granddaughters that are at 11 and 9. It is way too complex for them or me, their grandfather or my 30-something son and daughter-in-law. The instructions are very poor. It was extremely difficult to try and figure out the game. However we found a YouTube video that gave a very good explanation yet after watching it for about 10 minutes and we were only about halfway through the video we looked at each other and decided this game was way too complex and we threw it back in the box and put it away never to open again.

Best new game in a spell
","

  This is a game that manages at once reasonably complex for the experienced player, yet nonthreatening and learn-able for less experienced gamers. And everyone seems to enjoy playing it. It has rapidly become the favorite of several groups I participate in, in a way that no other game has yet done.On a purely aesthetic level.. the game and all the makings are nice. Even the instruction booklet just feels quality in the hand. Only thing letting me down in quality is the cardboard dice tower. And even thats ok, in most games would be good, but is slightly under par compared to the quality of rest of this game.Only two minor gripes.1.. It comes with 4 little plastic bins. But there are 5 types of food, 5 colors of eggs.. slightly annoying to someone who likes to put things away carefully where they belong.2.. The instructions are good, but a few technical aspects of game play could be more clearly spelled out. Easily solved by house ruling, and either way you end up answering the questions, it doesn't break or even really inconvenience the game.All in all.. with hundreds of games in my collection, this is the only one I bought new and have no buyers remorse over.

Been trying to buy this game for my wife for Christmas for the past 3 years!
","

  This is an amazing fun game to play with 1-5 people.  I wanted to get it for my wife because she is an avid birder.At first, she was overwhelmed trying to figure out how to play the game using the instructions that came with the game.  She tossed the papers at me and said, ""You figure this out!""  I fired up YouTube on the smart TV, and we watched a couple of videos on how to play Wingspan.  30 minutes later we were in the middle of first game!  The quality of this board game and it's components is the best.  The only thing that could be slightly improved is the storage for the bird food and eggs.  However, I've already 3D printed a solution from Thingiverse that solves that minor issue.  Even if you're not into birds, you'll still enjoy this game.  It doesn't take long to play a game - about and hour for a game with 5 people.  20-30 minutes for 2 players.  Coming up with different strategies to win is where we are at now with the game!

  This game is stunningly well made in every way. The game pieces are all simple and colorful, and the card tray and game piece trays are all sturdy plastic. The game mats are extremely helpful and well detailed, and the bird cards are all beautifully illustrated. My favorite part is the little bird feeder dice tower, its made of good quality cardboard and makes dice rolling fun and tidy too. Everything can be neatly packed in the box with a helpful item placement guide on the side, which is an excellent addition.The game itself is also very enjoyable, and simple to learn. I played it with three people for the first time and they all did very well, one of them even won even though they only looked at the rule book once. All the bird abilities are simply stated and fun because they all pertain to the abilities of their real world counterparts. Vulture cards, for example, get extra food tokens when another player's predator bird succeeds in ""killing"" a smaller bird. The wide variety of bird cards makes building a strategically designed bird habitat simple and super enjoyable. You almost take pride in the little aviary of birds you hand pick from the pile, and pray that each round you find your favorite bird.

A woman‚Äôs review
","

  This is an outstanding game in every respect. I confess to having a strong preference for games with beautiful components and this game does not disappoint. From the sweet pastel colored eggs to the birdhouse dice roller to the carefully drawn bird deck, the game is a joy to behold. The bonus cards and special bird powers make for tremendous replayability. It‚Äôs not an overly competitive game in that each player plays for the most victory points and there is no combat. As for complexity, it‚Äôs a mid weight game - more complex than Ticket to Ride, but simpler than Agricola. Once you digest the rules, game play is smooth and not a brain strain, which is not say that it‚Äôs not a game that requires forethought and strategy. It does. It‚Äôs just not overwhelming. But perhaps my favorite thing is that too many games involve monsters and fighting and are otherwise designed to appeal to teenage boys. This is a game my husband and son-in-law also love, but it‚Äôs a game that will appeal to other women who, like myself, aren‚Äôt into the whole DnD theme. We‚Äôve played about a dozen times now, and we are all still loving it.

Love this game
","

  I am not normally a gamer. I don't do well in competition. I get angry if I lose, so I stay away from games in general (not good for my health and my mental state of mind). But this game is so beautiful that I realized during the first playing of it that it doesn't matter whether I win or lose. I always learn something about birds, which is one of my passions. BTW, I am not a competitive birder, either, in real life. Those people drive me (excuse the pun) cuckoo. I just love birds and always have from early childhood.This game was hard to learn at first, but I was playing with three veteran gamers  at our family reunion. I had bought it for a birthday gift for my youngest sister who loves board games and also loves birds.  I kept losing, but it didn't make me angry or despondent, my usual reaction to losing a game. The game itself made me happy. When my husband and I returned home, I bought one for us, and so far we've played it every day. Hey, what else can you do when you're stuck at home because of a pandemic?The artwork is fantastic, and the bird information on the cards is great. It has a learning curve, but that should be expected with a game that is built on strategy, not complete luck. Of course, that element is there too, especially when playing the Automa game (a solitaire game against a player who has different ways of getting points than you do). But luck doesn't overwhelm the game, which is something I really like about ti.I recommend this game to anyone who loves birds. And/or games.

  Not so sure about this game.  I was hoping to learn about birds and instead I feel overwhelmed by game rules.  Does one actually learn about the birds?  Is there a way to play a simplified game without so many rules?I am giving this game away.  I would not recommend it for older eyes.  Hard to read.  Tiny cards.

Terrific Family Game
","

  Terrific game, I half-expected this to be something that would just appeal to bird fanciers - but its just an all around good family game. The materials are all high-quality, it'll hold up to children playing the game with you. Play is simple (even if it seems complex at first). Its an excellent tool to help someone who wants to familiarize themselves with different bird species and their habitats (not an expert, but all the cards I saw were accurate in the general detail they give).The product indicates its for 14+ but that's conservative. I played it with my ten year old, he beat me in our first game. The strategy is pretty complex (its definitely an engine-building game if you know the term), but the randomized elements are enough that some chance just plays into it for people even if they're a casual player against a strategic one.The dice-roller is also a bird house. Terrific and fun; it kept the five-year old who didn't play entertained just rolling the dice for us.

Wanted to hate this game, but...
","

  I wanted to hate this game. I am a serious gamer and this looked utterly ridiculous. A gamer friend felt the same, but because he wanted to buy a game and the only way his wife would let him is if he bought Wingspan, he relented. He then had the audacity to bring it to my place and I gave it a try. Two hours after he left I bought it. I love the artwork, the birds are well represented artistically and the educational value is fantastic as it gives the genus of each bird. There is ample strategy to go around and as the game progresses your turns become fewer and fewer, which I initially thought would be an annoyance, which it is, but it is very strategic and prevents you from playing in a carefree manner, you need to plan, which is a great component. IT is pretty simple to learn, we taught our 7 year old daughter, though if you have kids that age, make sure they are gamers, as this would not be the game to introduce to young children. As the game progresses, decisions become harder to make and even though our daughter is an ""experienced"" 7 year old gamer, the later rounds she needs more time to think through the moves with so much on the board.That said, the learning curve is about a 2.5 out of 5, it has fantastic replay ability given the sheer number of cards, and the expansions just increase that replay ability.If you are on the fence on this, get off, it is worth a buy and will probably visit your gaming table fairly often.

Stairway to Bird Heaven
","

  The ONLY reason you shouldn't buy Wingspan is if you are broke. The Swift Start Pack makes learning this dummy proof! I wish more games would have this, especially the complicated ones. In addition, this Swift Start Pack bring 10 new cards which mostly rock! Its also a different kind of game when playing two players vs 3 or more players, not necessarily a better one, just a different game strategy wise.If you still need convincing...Pros:*It is VERY FUN! I never cared about birds, but seeing the artwork and the funny description on the bottom of the  cards just made me giggle and appreciate the hobby. The production quality of this game is some of the best in board gaming for the price.*Building your bird sanctuary feels VERY REWARDING, and the pacing of the game is excellent. High Replay value.* It is RELAXING! It is not a very tense game, and has very little interaction with other players, yet it still feels like you are competing to have the most ""actions"" on your turn. It feels great to grab cards, lay eggs, grab food, and finally hunt smaller birds ALL in one action!!CONS (These are more nitpicky things I can think of that can discourage some players):*You may have a bad draw through out your game and it can bum you out as there is little you can do to ""fix"" this., though this has not happened to us often.*Seeing someone take a lot of actions in one turn can be frustrating knowing in your turn you will only be able to grab just one measly worm.I am a teeny bit worried about the integration of the upcoming expansions, as the original deck is so large that I feel like the expansions will get ""diluted"" by the main game and its possible that the new cards don't even come up during an entire playthrough, but that won't impact your enjoyment of the base game one bit.**No birds were hurt in the writing of this review**

Cute Theme Conceals Very Strong Gameplay
","

  Cute, fun game with a really engaging gameplay loop. We played with three players and it was a lot of fun. Just reading out the bird names as they came up was fun! The action selection mechanic and the way all the different birds did different things for you was very fun and well thought out. The way the game encourages you to develop an economic engine by setting up a chain of birds on each action slot that triggers every time you perform that action is really excellent as well. We felt it was a very ‚ÄúEuro‚Äù game, with a fun, innocent theme and medium-crunchy mechanics. The art and production quality are also top notch; this is a very beautiful and well-produced game. We especially liked how the player-mats had a ‚Äúleather‚Äù looking design printed on the back side so when they folded up they looked like leather bound portfolios. That was a superb creative touch and something a lot of publishers probably wouldn‚Äôt have bothered with. We thought it added a little extra aesthetic zing to the game and it‚Äôs illustrative of the very high quality of all the game‚Äôs cards and components.Definitely recommend this for anybody who has a bird enthusiast in their family or gaming group. The game is more complex than Monopoly but not so complex that you couldn‚Äôt teach your mom or ‚Äúcool‚Äù aunt to play it in one sitting.

Great addition to my game collection

  The game is made from quality materials (except the birdfeeder is a little flimsy ). As someone used to playing this style of game ( i‚Äôm a regular player of Lords of water deep, terraforming mars, above and below, near and far, city of iron, Islebound), I picked up on it easily and quickly.  For someone not used to managing different resources it might be a struggle at first. But they provide helpful starter guidance cards to walk novice players through their first several turns allowing them to get the hang of what the actions and steps are. That was so helpful!.  It is a very pretty game. Unlike a lot of games I play with this one you can do fewer moves with each turn/round whereas other games seem to start slowly and then you can do more and more things with each turn/round. Put a nice different spin on things and help to really focus and towards the end of the game on what was important to accomplish

  so this game playing by myself, doesn't take long and is fairly easy to learn, playing with 4 players took 2 hours and we didn't even finish the last round. granted 3 ppl were learning how to play it. everything about this game is beautiful but it is a very long intense game. since its turned based waiting for others to go is hard but the benefit of playing with more ppl is their cards that gives everyone bonuses so its worth it. its very pricey for 6ibs of board game! i was hesitant to spend that much but only did because i can play it alone. my husband hates complicated games so i will be playing it alone majority of the time.

  Seriously, this is one pretty game! It's been on my wishlist since it was originally announced and I'm glad I finally got it. Compared to other similarly priced board games you get some really nice components and the art is beautiful. Storage is included for most of the pieces, including a box to store the (very large) deck in. Probably one of my favorite little touches is a diagram on the bottom edge of the box that shows you how you can store all of the components neatly in the box.Once you understand how to play it's quite easy to keep up. I'd recommend watching an instructional video instead of using the manual, though, as the instructions can be a little unclear sometimes. A quick 10 minute or so video will give you everything you need to play from start to finish.

Awesome strategy. Could even be good for kids with mods
","

  This is a great game. Lots of possible strategy. Comfortably complex, but can be easily simplified by removing certain elements. I think this could be a really cool game for kids by removing the ""personal whole-game goals"" and the ""round end goals"". It really makes for much simpler strategy that way, with less variable to keep track of.I love the vast number and variety of bird cards (including European expansion). Makes for very different games when cards won't repeat often.The only mechanic no one has really used effectively in our games are the predator powered birds. They are few and far between, and they aren't very powerful.European expansion introduces some really powerful cards, which might be a bit unbalanced, but so far the power cards get distributed pretty evenly giving everyone a fair go.

  We learned how to play this game from friends who already knew how to play, so when we received our set, we didn't follow the instructions to learn. For us, it was simple to understand, and we got the hang of it quickly. If you are used to complex games like Catan etc., then this is a great game! When we've tried playing with friends and family, it's taken others a bit longer to understand it/they struggle to play.For now, my husband and I challenge each other almost every night, which is a fun changeup from Netflix.Bonus, the illustrations are downright gorgeous.

THE BIRDS!
","

  Can a competitive board game actually be calm, relaxing and rewarding? Yes, and this game helps prove that. With similar elements to PARKS and Azul (both top 10 board games in my opinion), Wingspan has so many different components that make it such a wonderful experience. We got the Swift Start pack which has 10 new cards that are used with 4 easy-to-play starting guides. You can then, seamlessly, put those 10 new cards into the deck.We have only played the 2 player version of the game as it's just me and my girlfriend. There are different modes whether you want people to take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc for each of the 4 rounds or if you want it to be less competitive and just give points for each round's goal, so both people could earn the max of 5 points.The only ""confusing"" part was understanding that you use an action cube once, so in the first round you have 8 turns, second round 7, third round 6, fourth/final round 5. You place the action cubes on the end of round bonus cards, even if you got 0 points.We can't wait to try this with more people or even a solo game as they bring in other cool things to make that.Finally, the cards and the production quality is impeccable.

  I'm going to keep this simple.This is a very fun game. Its simple enough to teach to kids (there are some nuances) but its not a brain dead easy game. I say this as a person who likes complex games like Magic: The Gathering and Terraforming Mars. The production value/quality is top notch. The artwork, game pieces, card material/texture, and rule book material/texture add a lot to the games visual appeal. There's also plenty of 3rd party support to ""bling"" your game out if you wish.It seems like this game is pretty popular and stores have trouble keeping it in stock. There's a good reason for that.

  Rules are easy to learn, yet game play is fun every time with many possibilities.  The game just flows.  Learning the rules is in the low moderate difficulty range.  You can learn about many different birds, but you don't have to.  Every turn is not too complex and yet entertaining.  The components are pretty and well designed.  The box is full and does not feel skimmed or cheap, knowing that some other games are actually more than half empty.  I can feel the designer's commitment to details and perfection.  The card tray is big enough for all cards, but not enough if all cards are sleeved.  It's still ok since the goal cards can be put in a ziplock bag and put in the space in the middle of the box; or some cards can be stored in the tray that also comes with the European expansion, which is also a good to have.

  We were introduced to this game by my Brother and Sister in law and before our first game had finished we had ordered a copy for ourselves, and my wife's parents also have since ordered it.  This game has replaced Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne as our go to game for game night.  This game is both fun and educational.  I've really been impressed by the quality, craftsmanship, and thought that went into this game.  The instructions and appendix booklets are printed on quality materials and very detailed.  The game itself is an engine building/resource gathering type of game.  Resources being food, eggs, and of course bird cards.  There are so many possible strategies that you can use to maximize points.  Each bird has unique stats, abilities and versatility.  You combine birds in one of three different habitat types to create the resource engine that best suits your strategy.  We love how versatile the game play is and each game is different.  I personally like that the scores are usually fairly close, making each game competitive which keeps all players engaged rather than just losing interest.  Stonemaier has created a great game here and it's no wonder this game has caught on like it has.

Fun Engine-Building Board Game

  You will build an ""Engine"" out of bird cards that becomes self sustaining as the game goes along. The process is very satisfying as you reach the later rounds. This game is pretty non-confrontational. I recommend this for anyone who is averse to ""take that"" mechanics or plays with people who are. It's a very chill game and the components are extremely nice. The only exception to the component quality is the dice tower shaped like a birdhouse. It's made of cardboard and requires careful handling. But that is a small flaw in an otherwise fun and beautiful game.

  This game is wonderful and so beautiful. The pieces are crafted in such a lovely way and I've learned a lot about the birds include in the pack.  Yes, it's not a simple game, but if you follow the included swift starter pack you will get the hang of it in no time. You could also watch youtube to learn to play. I'd say this game would be best for eager 10 year olds and up but my adult friends and I play it happily again and again. We even experiment by changing up the rules (starting with more food, not counting eggs as points, only drawing from the deck etc.) which keeps it fresh and our strategies changing. Excellent game.

Worth the Hype
","

  I heard raving reviews of Wingspan before it even officially launched, and I never really like to preemptively jump on hype trains. I regret not doing that exact thing, because this game is really REALLY a good time. The rules are daunting at first, and I definitely had some glassy-eyed stares from my board game group as I tried to explain the mechanics. As soon as we had our first couple turns down, things clicked, and we were all surprised at how intuitive and stream lined the game is from start to finish. An average game will run you about an hour, give or take 15 minutes depending on how chatty your table is. It's a beast of a game with unique flares that inspire laughs as much as it does intrigue.#Brant4Life

The details are well done.this is a game that everyone can enjoy. The only issues is my older friends have trouble reading the small print on the card. There should be a jumbo edition for them. I would also like an expansion pack of birds from Australia.

Beautiful, Fun, and Challenging!

  This game is a success! It has beautiful birds, and it is fun (though occasionally frustrating) to play. I love playing with my family, and it is a game you can enjoy, even if you don't ""win"" with the most points at the end. I got this version: Wingspan with Swift Start Pack because it was on sale, I didn't really try the Swift Start, nor have I tried the solo Automata version, as I prefer playing with others. But the multi-player game is great, though it takes a couple of times playing to really get the hang of the mechanics. We are still referring to the Instructions and Appendix to get clarification on certain bird powers, bonuses and end of round bonus points; the complexity keeps the interest and keeps one player from devising a crushing strategy. It all depends on the birds you are dealt, the birds you keep and play, and an ability to calculate your best plays near the end of the game. I just got the European bird expansion and am eager to see how it adds to the play!

  We adore this game! It's so beautiful, the play is fast and fun and different every time, the components are high quality and my family enjoys that everyone playing has fun, learns something practical about birds, AND it isn't a cutthroat game with attacks. Every time we play the game is very different, depending on each person's cards and strategies and choices for the game. It's straightforward to play, but deeply satisfying! It's been a great addition to our boardgame lineup!

  This is a fantastic game for people who like nature. It has a steep learning curve, but is forgiving of mistakes (we played it incorrectly a few times and it was still viable and fun), and once you have it down it‚Äôs easy to set up and play. The plethora of detailed bird cards are fabulous and we vie for favorite species - and learn about species we are not familiar with, too. A well-balanced combination of luck and strategy makes it possible for anyone to win, and every game is different. My preteen loves Wingspan, and so do I!

  After a practice round or two primarily figuring out where to place our action cubes this has become the house's favorite game (for the time being).  You essentially accrue resources in the form of birds, food, and eggs.  The game mixes card collecting, dice rolling, and individual player boards to keep track of everything.  Inter-round achievements and final resource tallying make for interesting short and long term decision making.  Due to the variety of scoring, my wife and I are still trying different strategies, from utilizing predator birds or simply laying as many eggs as possible.  Our friends enjoy it as well.  10/10, I can see us playing this for years to come.  My wife can't wait to try the European expansion.

  This is my wife's favorite game. I enjoy it about as much as she does. I loved scythe and viticulture is one of my favorite worker placement games, but this is different. I have used the swift start pack with in laws and my parents; while it helps initially, it is a hindrance when playing the second game. The game is pretty straight forward. While the price is steep, the art and design are great. Tokens are cardboard but the cards and player boards are nice. My wife bought me an organizer for it off Etsy for Christmas and that has made an even speedier setup. One thing I will say is the game feel like once you finally have a good engine built, the game stops. But this is largely based off of card draws. But then again, it also depends on how you want to develop your strategy. This is one of the lightest games that has had me continuing to wonder what the ideal strategy is. I rated it a 8.5/10

  The game is fun and has a lot of cool aspects in the pieces (like the birdhouse dice tower). However, the box arrived damaged with the corner crushed in and slightly torn. This also crushed the corner of the rules book. I'm kind of bummed because it was brand new and arrived damaged. My group couldn't wait to play so we opened it instead of doing a return. I highly recommend the game but would suggest finding it in a store rather than online once possible.

  I have been playing games for 60 years, and this is my favorite. I was glad to find it at a reasonable price. It's the kind of game where everyone is playing along, you know exactly when the game will end, but the scores are usually close enough that you don't know who won until all the different ways to accumulate victory points are added up. I love the classy looking game boards, and everyone fights over who gets to roll the food dice into the bird feeder. This game is a blast, and it doesn't take two hours to play (unless you're learning for the first time).

which is a nice upgrade from the previous model
","

  I use this game in my work as an SLP. I have used the older style for years and was hoping to see some improvements in this new release. The legs now attach to a solid square base, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model. However the tabs that help hold the ice in place still feel somewhat weak (as I'm sure they need to be a bit to allow the necessary give to squeeze the cubes in), but I'm hopeful they won't break as easily. The penguin substitute for the bear is nice, as something felt odd about knocking a polar bear into the ""water."" He feels sturdy and is really easy to put into the larger ice block. The hammer redesigns feel much better. The box fits everything just right when you first open it, but storing the game in this box is a bit of a hassle as it has to sit just right to close. I have taken to just storing the main square outside the box as it is hard to fit it all inside. Hoping this new release holds up better than the older version!

Getting the game put back together is a challenge for my 3 year old alone so you'll have to help get the ice pieces in sometimes. Everything fits back in the box easily and stores great.

  I have an original game with the Polar Bear that still works perfectly. I'm missing one block of ice and use the game with a classroom constantly. I ordered this as a second game.

  We bought this for our three year old daughter who loves boardgames. I had remembered living this game when I was a kid in the early 90s, and knew it would be a great family activity. While the game itself is the same, the materials have been changed in the last 30 years and not always for the best. I find it's difficult to keep the detachable legs on when turning the board over to replace the ""ice cubes"", which to a 3 year old is frustrating. The material for the cubes themselves is very different than I remember, and instead of them easily being knocked out one at a time, they tend to pull the adjacent cubes along. The mallets likewise seem to be a softer plastic that bends easily. Nothing has broken yet, but we do have a few ""crooked"" mallets.Even with those issues, we still have a blast playing this game together. It's a quick game, so it's easy to play multiple rounds before young minds want to move on to other things.

  The only thing I really don‚Äôt like about it is that the penguin falls out at every turn, I‚Äôm almost considering ditching the game box and finding an alternative box to keep the game is so I can glue the penguin in the middle.But it entertains my 3 year old which is why I bought it.

  The other reviews are true, it takes more time to setup than to play.  However it‚Äôs a great game for my 4 year old that lacks the patience to play more structured games.

Great quality, Meh Gameplay
","

  As a child of the late 70's/early 80's, I really wanted to love this game. There's plenty to love,  mind you, just not enough for me to play it more than once.First of all, the production quality of the game is top-notch.  The board, the ghosts, and Pac-Man are sturdy plastic and will probably last forever.  The tokens are cardboard and are printed on both sides.  Pac-Man makes a single, delightful ""wakka-wakka"" sound when you press down on him (like when he ""eats"" a dot).So, up to 5 people can play this game--1 person as Pac-Man and the rest as ghosts.  Pac-Man goes about the board trying to score points by clearing sections of the boards, eating fruit and ghosts.  Pac-Man's turn is over once he gets hit by a ghost.The problem is, only the Pac-Man scores points.  Each player has to take a turn as Pac-Man while everyone else plays the ghosts.  Why is this a problem?  Well, you have to reset the entire gameboard for each player--and this can be a chore.  When Pac-Man ""eats"" a dot, he pushes a peg/dot down into the board.  All those pegs/dots have to be pushed back up to reset the board.  I found that this usually required the four sections of the board to be disassembled--meaning they have to be reassembled which is no minor feat.As far as game play goes, it is very similar to the video game, just slower.  I will probably be sticking to the video game as I am unsure if I will ever break this game out again. My 7-year-old liked it until he experienced resetting the board a couple of times.I will say that if you are a huge Pac-Man fan and love all things 80's, then you may totally enjoy this game--at least for the first few times.  The Pac-Man and ghost figures may find their way onto a display shelf while the game stays in the closet.

A New Classic Board Game
","

  Personally, I really love this game. At first, I was hesitant, because it‚Äôs not the old version with the four Pac-Men and marbles, which I loved when I was a kid. The pegs as pictured on the box just looked kind of boring. But, my 6-year old daughter, who is a fan of the classic video game via the Apple Store app kept begging for this, so I got it. I was pleasantly surprised, and, in fact, like this better than the old 80s version. My daughter also loves it, and we have played it a few times in the few days since it delivered. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:The gameplay really does a good job of replicating how things work in the video game, much better than the 80s version. The player(s) controlling the ghosts is/are somewhat forced by rules to move them in an erratic fashion, emulating the unpredictable movement in the video game.  Seeing as this is the case, the player controlling Pac-Man has to be ultra-careful where/how he ends his turn, or he can quickly be caught. Ghost controllers have to plan thoughtfully, as, unlike the VG, they cannot move ghosts through each other unless they have been eaten and are in their ‚Äúeyes‚Äù form. You can quickly get them jammed up so they can‚Äôt efficiently chase their quarry. And don‚Äôt stop the ghosts turn too close to Pac if he‚Äôs near a power pill!  Pac-Man must also use careful strategy. He‚Äôs controlled by three dice, but the ghost-monsters move by shuffled, pre-printed numbers on cards‚Äî there‚Äôs an average max spaces, so try to stop your turn as far out of that max range as possible. When Pac-Man is caught, just once, that player‚Äôs turn as our favorite yellow pie man is over, he joins the players controlling the ghosts, the board is reset, and one of them gets a shot as Pac-Man. After everyone has controlled him, the player with the highest score wins. The three fruits also tend to appear at the most inconvenient moments, like the VG. They change out via fruit cards shuffled in with the ghost deck. Clear the whole board (not common) and you shuffle in the Level Two ghost movement cards, which give them a longer movement range to replicate a higher difficulty level. All very cool. The only con, which I feel is minor, is that the pegs have to be pushed up from under the board after Pac-Man is caught. One reviewer said he has to disassemble the whole board to do this, but I have not found that necessary. I just reach under each quadrant to do it before placing all the pawns back on the board. But you do have to be sure they are all up sufficiently so they don‚Äôt slip down again during play, which would cause the players to lose track of what PM needs to still clear, yet not TOO far up, or some may pop out. A bit of a pain, but considering how much fun this game is to play, I found it workable. You just need to take it slow and be patient! Initial setup installing all those pegs was also painfully tedious, but once they‚Äôre in they can stay in and you won‚Äôt have to ever do it again. So, the goodness greatly outweighs the cons, and overall, this board game is a blast that my family will play over and over for many years.PS: I forgot to mention the alternate play method offered in which Pac-Man has 3 lives, tracked by 3 markers, but you start with the Level 2 cards shuffled in from the beginning. More lives, but faster ghost-monsters! We haven‚Äôt tried this yet, but older or more advanced players may find this more interesting.

Fun game. Some complexity. Well designed
","

  The game is surprisingly fun and my kids enjoy it. I think the game is pretty well thought out though it has a bias toward the Pac Man player by design (though I suppose it‚Äôs a little obvious). There are a lot of rules so may not be as fun for younger players (say 5 or 6 y.o)I took out a star not because of the product but because the box arrived damaged. Would‚Äôve been really nice to have a pristine box as everything is pretty well designed.

Missing pieces!

  I purchased this game to keep the kiddos entertained during these times, and once we opened the brand new box, we read the instructions and context of game pieces, only to find out we are missing some of the pieces from the game! Don't know if we received a faulted product, or if all games are the same?The biggest drawback is all of the pieces are not included in the game the stamped tokens of the blue ghosts are supposed to include 16 and their stamp machine only stamped 15 tokens into the pressed board. We are able to play the game without the extra piece, but would prefer to get everything in the box it states is included

Ghost are Over Powered. I recommend -2 move penalty to all they draws for balance
","

  Quality is amazing, but the actual gameplay is broken. The ghosts are way too overpowered. Also after eating a power pellet if you roll bad you are toast. What I recommend is a -2 move penalty to every ghost card for true balance (but never below 1 movement for a ghost). Fruit regardless of pickup still counts as a turn lost for the ghosts.

  For the price, I thought this was going to be junk.  However, it is wonderful!  My family just finished a round of this, and we had a marvellous time!  The entire board is made of high-quality plastic and assembles easily.The 40-card deck is made of cards at standard C.C.G. card size (63 x 88) so sleeving them was a snap.  If you want to sleeve, just use ""penny"" for Magic the Gathering available at any card or gaming shop.The rules are easy to learn.  The gameplay is fast and furious.

  This game is a sad version of the original. With a bunch of really dumb ""action"" cards that have nothing to do with the game. The money just pours in for various reasons so there is no reason to manage your $$$. Reslly lame & wish I could return.

Too many changes, not the same game!
","

  I am so disappointed in this game. It is far from the game I grew up playing as a child in the 90s. We bought this for my daughter and I was excited to play it with her. We opened it and ugh! It doesn't have the 3d pieces, it has more career cards (which is fine), but I hate that it got rid of the toke Life cards, replaced them with a matching token for your car and then you use it to spin. You no longer get to chose 3 cards blindly, instead it is chose from the first two cards on top the deck. They have added a card category of vacation. Also added action cards. The action cards make this game HORRIBLE. On almost every spot that isn't a Payday, or baby, it is an action card. And everyone gets to spin the spinner to see how much money they can get. Essentially everyone gets a participant trophy after every turn. Yay *eye roll* anyway had I realized there was this many changes I wouldn't have bought this version and would have looked for an older version. Which I have already done, and purchased. Waiting on it's arrival. But seriously if you are getting nostalgic and thinking this is like the game you grew up playing, you are wrong. It isn't. This game really should be renamed because there is that many changes. Oh yeah and let's not forget about the trademarks for Travelocity. basically they have ruined this game!

  I loved this game as a child and figured I would loved to play this with my daughter on our game night.The game is great and the Action cards make players dance, sing, tell funny jokes and some other fun things.Overall I love the game.Only reason I gave it only 4.5 stars in one my wheel(picture above) is out of line with the numbers, red and black squares...which makes it difficult to play when you have to pick between red and black. I have tried fixing but it keeps going back to same position it came in.Second per picture above I recieved 2 pink cars...according to the cardboard place markers(picture above) one car should of been silver...which isnt a big deal. Until you have to girls playing and both want pink. Then during playing game both land on same square and they can't figure which game piece belongs to them.I hoping my game was a glitch and others don't have this problemOverall fun game. Worth the price.

Spinner is poorly made and doesn't spin well.
","

  The spinner for this game doesn't work well, it binds up and the cardboard attached to the bottom isn't firmly attached, so when spinning for red or black the red/black part doesn't always spin.  Some of the occupation cards were also pure white with no printing on them.  The spinner also doesn't attach to the board firmly so when trying to spin it it slides around.

Classic Game
","

  My little ones asked for this game for Christmas and they had a ball playing with it. Life is a fun game because it doesn't quite start the fights you get from Monopoly or Risk. By the time you get to the end, everybody is pretty much ready to be done playing. The other thing is that even if you lose, you usually retire with several million dollars, so you figure you'll be okay. The only in game assault on another player is when they roll your magic number and you have to pay them 20k, or the occasional fine from an action card. But the numbers on these are minimal and don't cause hard feelings.

Socialism in a board game! üòÇ

  If socialism is what you want to teach the kids, this version of LIFE is for you!  You no longer have student loans if you go to college, you just start off with less money.  Everyone goes on vacation at least once (new travel cards are sponsored by Expedia) and Action cards ensure everyone retires wealthy at the end. It's hilarious üòÇ. I played with my 8 year old nephew and then bought the game just to play with my friends so we could compare it to the game we grew up with. Reality vs. Fantasy is how I'd describe the original vs. this version. It was still fun to play and way quicker.

  This is not the game we used to play.  There are no plastic buildings built into the board, just a super cheap, crappy working spinner that sort of slides onto the corner.  The monty haul character of the game is stupid and the ""life lessons"" kids might learn from it are completely backwards.  This could be a really good game, and the old one was a lot better.  As with so many things, the advance of manufacturing progress has removed any benefit and made it cheap and suck.  Find an old one at a garage sale instead.

Disappointing update to a formerly great game
","

  The Game of Life has always been tremendous fun to play... until now.  This latest update to the game rushes you through a very short road from start to finish.  Without any real element of risk, in that there are very few penalty spaces that require you to lose money, it's essentially a contest to see who collects the most money a little bit at a time.  The numerous new occupations really don't mean much, as they're essentially salary cards that happen to have random job titles printed on them.  Essentially, this version of Life is a very pale imitation of what was once a tremendously fun game.  Unless young children are playing, you'll certainly enjoy older versions of the game much, much more.

Different than the original but ok
","

  We had the older version of Life and this is quite different. It has a lot more interaction (when you get a life card a lot of times you have to ""duel"" other players).My biggest gripe is there weren't any $20k bills. You run out of $10k bills really fast because of the way things are paid. We took the bills out of the old game and made it work! Also, some of the rules are unclear (ie, when someone spins your number and you get paid, but what happens when 2 people have the same number?) And the spinner goes flying if you don't hang onto it. The little tokens that you put on your number get stuck in between the plastic and cardboard so we stopped using them after 1 time

  This is a  game from my childhood.  We spent hours dreaming about who we'd be and where our paths might take us.  So far, we like the update! Pros: Easy to learn and easy to play for families of all ages. It appeals to my tweens who want to play all the time, game play isn't too long so no one loses patience.Cons: This game comes folded in 4's so you have seams to contend with. Chips are easily lost because they are translucent. The spinner isn't integrated in gameboard easily, so someone has to hold it in place while other players spin. The color wheel in the spinner moves around, making it difficult to tell which color you've landed on. overall, 4 out of 5 stars

SPECS, AND COMPARING THIS GAME TO SCRABBLE PURCHASED OVER 40 YRS AGO
","

  I am comparing the Scrabble game by Hasbro Gaming in a bright red box with white ""SCRABBLE"" on front and pictures of lots of letter tiles that I purchased on July 13, 2019 ..... ANDa Scrabble game I purchased over 40 years ago that came in what I consider a purple box, some may call it dark burgundy or dark wine.  My old game has gold lettering on the box, no pictures, and the box is kind of a textured cardboard, not smooth and glossy.COMPARISON:For anyone who just wants the main two differences without reading everything:1.  The new game has a larger board, but the actual playing area of the board is almost the same.The new board has a wider strip down one side to say ""SCRABBLE"" and to tell you how many of each letter there are.  It tells you this on both sides of the border, facing the player who sits on either side.2. The new game has lightweight red plastic racks to hold your letters. My old game has heavy duty wooden racks.  Both WORK fine, but I  prefer wood personally.If you want more exact specs and differences, as well as what HASN'T changed, read on:Old Board measures a tad over 14 1/4  x 14.  The actual playing area is  12 1/4 x 11.New Board measures just shy of 15 1/2  x 14.  The actual playing area is 12 1/2 x 11 1/4.Both boards fold in half.  Mine is still in great condition. Hopefully new board will hold up as well.The backside of the old board is purple (or wine?). The back side of the new board is black.The instructions are printed inside the lid on the old game; on a nice brochure in the new game.The box for the old game measures 14 1/2 x 7 1/2 and is kind of textured heavy duty cardboard.The new game box measures 15 3/4 x 7 1/2 and is a lighter weight standard cardboard game box.The old game tells you only on one end of the board how many of each letter, so it is upside downand hard to see for the person sitting on the opposite side. The new board has it printed on both ends of the wide border, facing in the direction of the person sitting on either side, so it's easy to read for both.The Double Letter, Double Word, Triple Word colored squares on the board are the same on both.The letter tiles are the same size in both and definitely look and feel like wood to me, in both.  There are 98 letters and 2 blanks in both games, and the same number of each letter in both games.  (There are more of commonly used letters such as vowels, especially E and A, and N's and R's.  And only one of letters like J, Q, X and Z, but the same number of each letter in both games.)The really big difference:  the nice wooden racks in the old game vs. the cheap red plastic racks in the new game. Although I greatly prefer the wooden ones, I did not deduct a star for three reasons:  1, people who have never used the old game with wooden racks would probably think nothing of the plastic ones since most games these days have everything plastic everything.  (Had the letter tiles been plastic, I WOULD have deducted a star!)  2, the plastic racks get the job done, no problem. 3, the price of this game, $11.99 when I bought it, is very reasonable for what you get, so it wouldn't be fair to expect the same quality of a game you pay considerably more for.The letters look to me like they are printed in slightly larger, thicker type on the new tiles, which is a GOOD thing.  Still black letters, against very light wood tiles, which is best.The new game came with a black drawstring back, plenty large enough to hold all the letters with ease. My old game did not come with a bag, but I am fine with keeping them on the bottom of the box under the board.I consider this game a good value for the money and I would definitely recommend it, although I would point out to anyone I recommended it to that it has plastic racks, so they aren't disappointed.

Functional, but does not hold a candle to the older version.

  I bought this for my family because our old board was split on the crease. The set also had a ""patina"" to it that everyone loved, but I know that it is food and dead skin cells and that is gross as french toast. This version does not replace what we had. The board is a major improvement, since it is not split down the middle. The trays are plastic, which is probably my biggest objection. There are actually four of them, which was news to me as our old set only had three trays with it. The letters are wood, which is good, but they are just printed on and not engraved like the old set. That is probably a good thing because now nobody will spend ten minutes picking his or her letters pretending like they aren't trying to feel for the letter she or he wants. The font is wrong. Also, between the new board and the new tiles, they whole thing is very slippery. So if you breath real hard on the board, the tiles go every which way. I'm used to needing to make adjustments to the letters, but not to this extent. The new board and tiles allow for room between the tiles and that sucks. With the old set, you could lay the tiles touching and they all fit fine. The bag is flimsy, but we have an unopened Crown Royal, so it will be replaced soon. It isn't all bad. The game works, all the pieces were there. I think I will invest in a better version some time in the near future.

Classic in Name Only
","

  I ordered this game to use at the monthly ""Secret Headquarters Comics and Games for Everyone Off-Site Game Night"" in Tallahassee.  (Yeah, it's a long name, but now Brian, our Genial Host, owes me one!)  Anyway, I brought Scrabble, mainly because I did not know how to play any of the other games.When we opened it up, I think we were all expecting the look and feel of the ""classic"" Scrabble of our childhoods.  You know, heavy, smooth finished tiles and tile racks and a game board that felt like it could take years of carting around and gaming.This game is sort of a lightweight version.  Everything is there, but it's just feels a bit small and less substantial .  The tiles and racks have minimal finish on them, and the board is thinner.Now, as far as playing, this is a fine set.  However, do not be expecting the original-feeling Scrabble game.  I think if you want the truly ""classic"" set, you have to spend a little more.Why 4 Stars:  The product lives up to its description (if not my nostalgic expectations).  The price is right, and amazon delivered in a timely manner.Problem:  This may be an isolated problem; however, one of the tile racks was missing.  When I alerted amazon to this, as per its usual excellent customer service, it immediately arranged a replacement game to be sent to me. That's another reason for 4 stars--I love good customer service.BTW, I learned to play two new games last Friday:  Flux and Ticket to Ride Europe.  And by ""learned,"" I mean that I lost my shirt.  I will have to see if amazon carries these games, so I can catch up on some of this new-fangled stuff!UPDATE-24 hrs. later: The replacement Scrabble game has arrived, and all 4 tile racks are there!

Cheap quality
","

  The tiles have the letters printed on instead of engraved and painted. They, and the bag that they come in, have been outsourced to China.The board is flimsy. Scrabble has gone from a quality product to a shadow of what it used to be. Instead of something to keep in the family and use for years, it's now got a disposable feel to it.It would be better to spring for a used older version from Ebay or a garage sale than to buy a new, cheapo version.Maybe they want to nudge you to get the turntable edition (which is very handy), since it is so much more expensive.

  Returned and bought the ""deluxe"" version.  This board is flat and does not spin, so the tiles slide all around when moving it around (or someone has to read the board upside down).  Pay the extra for the board with recessed game spaces, so the tiles don't move.  The deluxe version also rotates on wheels.

A big thumbs up from our family

  I grew up playing scrabble and always loved it. Sadly my daughter recently told me that we seriously dropped the ball in her board game education. Amazon to the rescue, I ordered the game and it was delivered the very next day. I can happily say we have played many games of scrabble and she loves it just as much as I do.The board is a little flimsy but you just have to be careful. I love the drawstring bag to keep the letters in and the plastic letter stand work just as good as the old wooden ones.

Cheap, painted tiles. Just buy the cheapo tiles, because these are NOT the good tiles you're looking for.
","

  I purchased this game purely for the tiles. I already have two sets of Scrabble tiles that I use for my spelling and word work centers in my classroom. I can live with the plastic trays (although I prefer the wooden ones, like the ones I already have). My biggest complaint is that the tiles are all wrong! They are about 1mm longer and wider than the original tiles. The tiles are painted, not embossed. The font is wrong. If I had wanted tiles like this, I would have purchased one of the multitudes of cheaper options available, and bought hundreds of tiles. I cannot mix these tiles with the ones I already have, because they DO NOT MATCH. I am an unhappy customer with this set.

  I had a treasured old English Scrabble set (green box by Spears) with heavy smooth blocks & rounded edges, excellent thick quality board and plastic letter ledges I had been given by an old friend when I was a boy, and had kept in pristine condition. My ex kindly took it. So I researched, and was strongly considering buying the exact replacement, or the American version (red/burgundy). I elected to save my hard-earned dollars & buy the $14 model here. I couldn't be happier. Board is reasonable quality; wood letters are sunken & embossed; plastic shelves are reasonable quality. What's not to like at fourteen dollars over 60 bucks?

  We had a 40+ year old set and recently began playing with our young grandson so decided to buy him his own game as part of his birthday gift.  While he was very excited, because he enjoys the game, we were very disappointed because the parts are not made of wood, like our older set, but of hard plastic.  Its not at all durable.

  A wonderful, educational game to pass the time and stretch the muscles of the mind.  Keep in mind that all players should be around the same level of education.

  I bought this game when I had been off work for months after having foot surgery! My wife and I got bored and wanted something to stay busy to move the time along! My wife asked what my childhood favorite game was and I said Scrabble and she agreed she felt the same way! She ran across this game and purchased it without hesitation! When we got it it was just like old times and had all the special features of wooden holders and game pieces. Yes the board seems a bit thinner than I remember but didn't stop us from enjoying the activity! If you are looking for something that will bring the past back this game should do it.

  One thing I like about Scrabble it is easy to set up and get ready to play.  My 8 year old grandson does all the setup and most of putting the letters, board and trays away.  If there is a question about the rules or a word is challenged,he checks it out in the dictionary  My 5 year old granddaughter writes down the scores for each person,s turn.  She also makes words on her tray, but still has a little trouble with placing them on the board.  Of course, for me the best part of playing SCRABBLE is spending time  with my grandchildren and knowing this game is helping them learn to spell and add numbers.  The real best part is we all laugh a lot together.

  For a cheaper option, this set is fine and allows for great game playing.  A few minor 'grouses'.  The tiles are not very consistent in size - not bad, but not all exactly the same size.  The wood of the tiles is very light (I'm not sure what type of wood, but not the heavier beech wood that my old set was made from).  Now a few good points.  The printing is clear and easy to see (my wife doesn't have very good eyesight, but can see these tiles easily).  The board seems substantial enough for longevity, although the side panel seems to be bigger (wider) than necessary.  All in all, good value.

  This is one of those feel-good documentaries that you put on when the world feels like it's too much. The director shows a lot of empathy for his subjects. One of the board games being featured has some problematic racial connotations. (My nice way of saying the mini-figs used and the title come off as racist despite the maker's own experiences informing the game.) Instead of shying away from confronting that aspect of the game, the director uses interviews with the creator as well as game executives to discuss the lack of diversity in gaming.Other aspiring designers are followed as well with varying degrees of success in selling their games either on their own or to major board game publishers. I do wish there was some follow-up at the end letting viewers know what the creators are up to now.All in all, it's a well-done glimpse at the development of tabletop games featuring interviews with many of the biggest names in the industry.

The best board game of all time
","

  This is the best board game I have ever played.  Okay, it helps that I love Dune (the book and the 1984 movie).  But the mechanics of the game is just genius.  They found a brilliant way to incorporate the sand worm, spice, weather storms, poison, poison snooper, lasgun (which, if played against a shield acts like an atomic explosion), family atomics, and characters/factions into how the game plays, which makes it an absolute thrill for those of us familiar with the story (especially if familiar with the book) but also quite fun for those who are not.  I highly recommend reading the book in and of itself, and you will see for yourself how it all ties in together.  If the book is too much, just watch the 1984 movie (not the horrible ""SyFy"" series re-make, which is an abomination with terrible acting).There is an incredible balance between the factions that shows it must have been painstakingly tested.  The Harkonnen initially seemed like they were way too powerful (they get 4x as many traitors and 2x as many treachery cards, making them a nasty faction to fight with) and the Emperor seemed too rich, but as I've tried out the other groups I have come to see how their unique abilities can be used to crush the Harkonnen and make life hell for the Emperor using the Fremen, Atreides, or guild.  Still not used to the Bene Geserit, but haven't played that faction myself yet.I actually play the game with my 10 year old, 8 year old, and 7 year old.  The 7 and 8 year old don't quite grasp the strategy, but follow the rules perfectly.  My wife is not much of a board gamer, but after the first game she came to like the game as well.  After the first game the whole thing flows fairly well.  There are excellent videos from the company detailing the rules in a simple and effective fashion.  But there is a very well written quick start manual in addition to the more detailed manual.  You can start playing pretty quickly - don't believe people who say its too complex.It may not be for people who are easily offended or bear a grudge.  When, as the Fremen you use the sandworm to wipe out someone's entire army, or as the Atriedes use your prescience to trick people into paying a lot of money for a worthless card, or as the Harkonnen destroy someone's entire army by simply controlling their general as a traitor, or as the rich Emperor you gloat over everyone who has to call ""CHOAM charity"" you will sometimes tick off your friends/family and they may seek revenge on you the next round.  I just sit back and watch my children fight each other and me and just laugh, grateful that at the end of the game I don't actually live in the treacherous and Machiavellian world of Frank Herbert's Dune.

I‚Äôm so glad I own this game
","

  This game is a classic. This is the most recent rerelease of the game since it first came out around 1979. It is highly political, combative and focused around occupying territories. It include Factions in the game play so if you‚Äôre not used to that, you basically have multiple character groups to choose from to play during the game. Every faction has its strengths and weaknesses. Once the game picks up you have the option to form alliances with other players and their factions. This allows players to share their strengths with other players and hopefully helping you both win the game together.There are many twists and turns that the game takes and it is very strategy heavy. Best part is that everyone has a different strategy because everyone‚Äôs character is so different. And yes there is backstabbing that can happen in this game.  Learning the game took us a few game plays and we still haven‚Äôt narrowed down all of the specifics and have had to google a couple things to get more clarity on how to proceed in specific situations. Also - it‚Äôs a long game. We‚Äôve only played a few times but one of our games did end up lasting for 5 hours. It‚Äôs such a great game for board game enthusiasts. I definitely recommend it!

A unique experience that you will want to play again and again
","

  The GameDune is unlike any other game I've ever played. Every player controls a unique factions with awesome, game-changing advantages and abilities that make each one unique to play and to play against. It is a game of secrets, surprises, alliances, betrayals, conquest and comebacks. Perhaps most intriguing of all, itIt seems daunting at first, there are a lot of rules to go over and almost all of them have an exception to remember. But while that can seem intimidating, the gameplay itself is actually quite easy to pick up, and all those exceptions are lore based and so are easy to remember when you get why they are there. Having started with a group of first timers that don't normally play overly complex board games, I can attest to the fact that it is actually quite accessible. Just take the time to go over the rules, maybe have a quick practice game for a turn or two, and everyone should be able to get it.The rules are broken up into basic and advanced rulesets. I personally recommend skipping to the advanced rules right away since they are where the best parts of the game are and you don't want to have to unlearn bad habits from the basic rules. That said, I think the general consensus is to ignore the ""Advanced Combat"" rules which just add a distinctly unfun spice tax to battles. The Advanced Combat rules are meant to be paired with the Increased Spice Flow rules, which add more money to the economy, and many groups keep those even after ignoring the spice tax because it adds a little more money and more opportunities for alliances, but it works either way.This VersionThis game is a re-release of a classic board game that, as I understand it, had been held up by rights issues for decades. People have been waiting for this game to hit the market again since the 80s, and often printed up their own versions, and there's been an active tournament scene. It is a game that has withstood the test of time and then some.The art, layout and build quality are excellent. The cutouts from the battle wheel also give you extra blank tokens, which are good for homebrewing or simply making additional trackers or tokens (I used mine to make tokens showing the benefits of controlling certain strongholds, which can be passed to the player controlling them). There's a lot of information that is displayed clearly and concisely, it looks beautiful doing it, and the materials are all built to last.I do have a few nitpicks in the design. First, the faction tokens which sit in front of each player are in the middle of a ring around the board where the storm tracker goes, forcing you to move it out of the way when they overlap. It's a harmless annoyance, but it was also a completely avoidable design flaw. Second, the orange and red factions are just a little too close in color, and in a dimly lit room, they can occasionally be confused at a glance. Third, there is a phase tracker on the board but the token that travels along it is not included for those that didn't pre-order, and even we didn't get a fancy 3d printed sandworm, a simple cardboard ring would have been nice. And I've seen several groups that highlighted the line marking the borders of Fremen staging grounds, which should have been a clear part of the map or at least given as a map in a reference guide for the Fremen player to be able to see (I made one from a small printout of the map).But as I said, these are nitpicks, the kind of thing I would like to see fixed in future releases but not any reason to hold back now.The PublisherWhen I got the game, I found several components were damaged (seemingly in manufacturing) and contacted the publisher. They responded quickly and sent replacement parts in the form of a mostly complete game which had almost certainly been a return, but which had all the items I needed essentially untouched. Except the board itself was more damaged than the one I had. After contacting them again, they rushed out a new copy of the game rather than risk another problem.Excellent customer service that focused on resolving the problem and which went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of.The GameplayThe majority of the game revolves around bidding for treachery cards (equipment), landing and moving troops, and resolving battles.* The bidding phase has players take turns bidding or passing on face down cards, with the card going to whoever has the highest bid once all others have passed, an auction with the structure of betting in poker. Each turn will have a number of cards up for bid equal to the number of players that aren't at their hand limit, so just enough for everyone to get a single card in theory, but.* The movement phase lets players land a single stack of troops in any one territory on the board (except in a storm or a stronghold with 2 factions), limited only by the cost and the number of reserves they currently have. They may also move a single stack of troops on the board, allowing them to attack enemies, gather spice (money), or simply move to safety. You only get one landing and one movement per turn, so despite all the depth of strategy, turns are fairly quick and the choices are often agonizing.* The battle phase resolves those battles set up in the movement phase. Each battle happens on two levels, the troops and the leaders. Each player puts together a secret battle plan consisting of the number of troops they are willing to sacrifice, the leader they are sending in, and any treachery cards they want to play, mostly weapons and defenses. If a weapon is played and the other player does not play a corresponding defense (ranged or poison), the targeted leader is killed. When the plans are revealed, add the number of troops sacrificed to the bonus from the leaders if they survived, and the side with the higher number wins. The winner loses all the troops they sacrificed, the loser loses all their troops and any equipment they played, and both sides keep their own leader if they survived. And if the leader they played is the one whose card you secretly chose from 4 dealt to you at the beginning of the game to be your traitor, you can negate the entire battle, wiping out their side entirely while losing nothing.* You win the game by holding three strongholds by yourself at the end of a turn or four strongholds between yourself and an ally at the end of a turn.What makes those interesting are the unique factions.* The Atreides can look at the face down cards as they are being bid on, and have a reliable income selling information both before and after the bidding, and they can ask to know one part of their enemy's plan in every battle.*The Harkonen get double the treachery cards and four times the traitors, and after winning a fight they can kidnap an enemy leader or just kill one and sell its corpse.* The Fremen don't have to pay to bring in troops, can move faster in the desert, are resistant to the hazards of the dessert, and have special forces that count as double troops.* The Bene Gesserit can compel opponents to play or not play a specific card in a battle, get free charity every turn, can choose to be noncombatants to peacefully coexist with other factions whether they like it or not, and can turn worthless cards into miracle cards.* The Spacing Guild takes its movement phase whenever it chooses rather than in the turn order, pays half price for landing troops, and is the one everyone else pays when they land troops* The emperor has special forces, and is the one who collects all the money paid for cards in the bidding phase.There's more, but you should be able to see from the summary above that the interaction of these factions is fascinating and dynamic. Especially since they can ally with each other and share some of their advantages.And of course, the special victory conditions are great. The game has a 10 turn limit. If no one has achieved victory at the end of the 10th turn, and no other special victory conditions are achieved, the spacing guild (and ally if any) wins for having maintained the status quo. If at the end, the Fremen (or no one) have control of their ancestral strongholds and no great houses hold the smuggler's stronghold, the Fremen (and ally if any) wins for having kept the outsiders from taking control. And then there's the Bene Gesserit, who at the beginning of the game choose a faction and a turn number. If that faction wins on that turn, they have played into the manipulative hands of the Bene Gesserit, whose carefully prepared schemes come to fruition, granting the Bene Gesserit (but NOT their ally) the true victory (possibly my favorite rule in any game ever).TL:DRGet this game. Play this game. Love this game. It is an experience that you simply cannot pass up, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

  I'm very happy to have this items in my hands when I think always wanted to play, because I have a friend who knows the 1979 edition and I heard from him.How ever, he insisted that ""$ 50 for it's expensive!"", which was my concern, but, when I opened the box of the 2019 edition, I was very satisfied with the quality of the components.For example, the thickness of the cards is very thin, but not flapping, tokens and game boards also seemed to use very high quality materials, and it comes with a tray to hold each component.I will attach the picture of the contents for reference.

  This game is massively complex and completely on brand as an adaptation of the epic Dune saga. It works just fine as a two player game: Atreides vs Harkonnen. I highly recommend you do a few play-throughs of the Basic Game before tackling the Advanced rules. Beautiful game board and quality tokens. The game box has a tray to hold the blivets sorted by faction. It's not for the casual boardgamer or fan... If you like Fantasy Flight style games with many moving parts and complex multi-stage turns, give it a go.

Beautiful reprint with streamlined and clarified rules you can probably get for under $50
","

  This is a beautiful reprinting of the 1979 original which was then printed by Avalon Hill. This reprinting, in addition to the absolutely beautiful and stylized art throughout, clarifies some rules and provides both a basic and advanced play option, complete with a quick start guide. They've also streamlined and clarified some rules, as well as made various balance changes both overall and faction-specific. Presumably this will lead to better game play (and definitely faster games with the maximum number of game turns being reduced to 10 from 15 in the original), but I haven't played yet to verify. Also if you were really invested in getting the 1979 experience but don't want to track down a beat up original copy, the original rules are available online and this game will pretty easily facilitate that with some small changes (like providing the Bene Gesserit a way to pick up to turn 15 as the end turn). Cardboard is sturdy and nice, much more resilient and with better tactile feel than the original.So the bad for me is, first and foremost, I'd like a little more contrast on the game board itself. The colors on the cards and tokens are great, but then the board itself, while stylized and fitting for the game, isn't quite as easy to glance at and pick out all the important details as I would like. Some borders seem a little difficult to read, especially with how irregularly shaped they are, and certain graphics sort of blend in when they should stand out more, I think. Maybe my opinion on this will change from an actual play through, but my first impression is that it could be a little easier to read with more contrast/color to some graphics on the board.Secondly, the spice tokens are utilitarian and the least beautiful part of the game to me. They do their job, but considering the special place of the spice in the Dune universe, I want these to feel like more than bulk coins even if that's all they are mechanically. I'll probably replace the cardboard chits with plastic ""shards"" of some sort that look appropriate.Lastly, the price. I got this from GameNerdz for about $38. There was a deal at the time, but I don't think it was 50% off as a preorder. Shop around a bit before committing to a listing almost double what was available.

  What an absolutely amazing game, Dune is one that you'll never fully learn without repeated plays.  Until then you will be constantly surprised and at times a little confused as to how everyone interacts and how best to triumph in this epic fantasy game.  Having some base knowledge of the Dune franchise goes a long way into introducing new players to this game and having them being fans of it make it even better.  I love this game, but a player with no knowledge at all of Dune before your bring it to the table will have a harder time getting into it.That aside, for everyone else who knows and loves Dune you will find one of the most amazing gaming experiences of your life when you get a full table of friends to play this.  An epic battle will ensue where knowledge is power, bribery is encouraged, and treachery is to be expected.  Your first game will be on the longer side of things as everyone familiarizes themselves with locations, movement, battle, and other phases of gameplay, subsequent games though have a very satisfying flow and harmony to them.  This is in part of how amazingly balanced and well designed this game is.Beyond learning the rules I cannot think of areas of the game where something goes wrong or doesn't work correctly, things are fair and one faction‚Äôs weakness might be later in the game offset by an alliance with another faction.  The combinations, decision making, and tactics are endless and aside from the end game objectives being ""mostly"" the same each game will feel like its own unique experience.  This is one of those games you'll remember stories about and retell them later, as you're setting up you'll recall who betrayed you last time.  Repeated plays of Dune take on a life of their own and builds an ambiance and mood around the game that you just can't get enough of.I'm very happy with all the components and art style of things, the box is great looking and the rules although confusing on a first read through are laid out very well and explain most everything.  My own personal wish and the only con I could think of would be that I would have liked a larger playing board and some larger fonts used on the sector spaces.I often don't even think you can call Dune a board game, as it so much more than that.  The amount of player interaction, alliances happening, and exchanging of vital game information all going on around you make this almost akin to an RPG in a very loose use of that term.  Win or lose, I've never not enjoyed this game, and while it is not one I would play all the time the infrequency of how often Dune comes to the table makes the anticipation of the experience that will no doubt unfold be all the greater.  A great game and definitely one to add to your shelf.

  Dune drips with theme.  It's, in a way, an open world game of alliance and intrigue.  On its own it's a great game, but if you read the books the rules are way easier to learn because they make sense, giving the faction you play almost a role play feeling.  The mechanics are balanced pretty well.  If playing less than 4, my friends decided to leave alliances out.  In one game I tried the Guild, and thought I made a bad decision by turn (round) 2 as I thought I clenched victory in less than 15 minutes.  But I hadn't, and I hadn't. The Beni Gesserat at the table was able to thwart my victory with voice and dealt a major blow.  After that we went about 4 or 5 more turns before someone (not me) was declared the victor.  Until the game ended all my moves felt critical, and kept me on edge.  In the end, it was a memorable, exciting game that made me want to play more and try different factions or the same ones.  I recommend this game for its overall unique game play, heavy thematic elements, and excitement that comes with having your faction advantages or falling victim to another faction's abilities.

  The true test of a board game's greatness is if you have a good time when you aren't winning. I've played twice, lost both times, and had an absolute blast.I would however reccomend you have a stiff drink at the ready for when your first two battles end in betrayal, the sand worm eats all your troops, and someone blows up the shield wall while launching the storm half way across the map to finish wrecking you.I think the beauty of the game comes from two sources. First, the fact that wildly asymmetric factions are wonderfully balanced. Strategy comes not from doing the same thing as your opponents except better, but instead from boldly playing to your opponent's and your own strengths and weaknesses. The second thing that makes this game great is that victory usually feels just barely out of reach. This lets you scheme for the win throughout the game.

  Dune is both simple and complex at the same time with more back-stabbing and backroom deals than most other games I've played; not for those who want co-op games.  I've spent hours and hours playing it and teaching it to others (I ran over 200-players through games at Gen Con 2019).  The rules are simple and concise.  I've found that the best games we've experienced were with an even number of players (2, 4, or 6) but odd works too.  Don't be afraid to try different combinations as allies (Atreides and Harkonnen are a powerful if not unexpected combination).  And use your factions special abilities to their fullest.

  This is a great game that I spent too much time playing while at university in the 1980s -- now reissued after being unavailable for many years. I need to look at the rules to see if there are any changes.  We tweaked some of them ourselves back in the day to reign in a particularly overpowered character (I'm looking at you, Harkonnen) and improve the game dynamics in other ways. So my advice is don't be afraid to tinker with the rules if you need to. Nothing is carved in stone! Enjoy.

  Av excellent reprint of a classic Avalon Hill title. My main complaints with this game are that it requires some time and play-throughs to get a feel for all the moving parts, capabilities of all the factions, and careful attention to the mechanics. Our first 3 games went less than 3 rounds, but still took the better part of 2 hours with 4 players... Now that we're experienced, I think we might actually be able to pick up the pace and have a more challenging competition; but, I would still recommend changing one mechanic: allow each unit of forces to move (spread out) independently, every turn, once on the planet. That being said, this game is the truest adaptation of Herbert's classic in game-form I have yet encountered: you really can recreate the events in the books, and a whole lot more! The difficulty is all in the learning of the nuances of the rules, which are well balanced, but not as clearly explained in the manual as they might have been... I actually spent about an hour or so, annotating in the margins, so that I could better explain how the game was supposed to run after the first run-through crashed, with cooperative victory (due to all of us misunderstanding some important features) on round 2 (this game is engineered to expect 10 rounds of play). If you love the DUNE universe you may have the determination and commitment to develop an enjoyable competence to play this game: it's just not something you can easily introduce others to, ad hoc. Nonetheless, the Advanced rules version is much more satisfying. Strongly recommend outlining the area on the board where the Fremen-faction can spawn troops (highlighter or metallic marker), for ease of all.

  Uno dei miei giochi da tavolo preferiti in assoluto fa il suo ritorno trionfale sulla scena. Dune √® un gioco di strategia ambientato nel mondo di Arrakis e vede varie fazioni, gioiosamente asimmetriche per forza e capacit√†, sfidarsi a colpi di battaglie, alleanze e tradimenti per conquistare il pianeta. Detto cos√¨, sembra una variante di Risiko, ma √® molto di pi√π. Vi basti sapere che non ci sono dadi per decretare il vincitore delle battaglie e che ogni fazione √® realmente diversa dalle altre e perfettamente in grado di vincere. Questa versione √® rispettosa dell'originale Avalon Hill di moltissimi anni fa, senza rinunciare a una veste grafica rinnovata e leggermente pi√π moderna. Per me, promosso a pieni voti!

  Gale Force Nine hat es geschafft einem absoluten Klassiker neues Leben einzuhauchen. Das Spielmaterial ist wertig und macht einen langlebigen Eindruck, und hat auch ein ansprechendes Design, aber das ist Geschmackssache. Manko an der Verpackung ist wieder dass keine Druckverschlussbeutel mitgeliefert wurden, aber irgendwas ist ja immer.  √úber die Qualit√§t des Spieles sollte man sich am besten selbst ein Bild machen und sich eine ausf√ºhrliche Rezension oder ein Let's Play auf Youtube ansehen. Das Hauptmerkmal in diesem Spiel ist wohl asymmetrische Strategie, wem das zusagt, und die Tatsache dass man seine Freunde zu einem min. 2  (aber eher so 3-4) Stunden Spiel √ºberreden muss, f√ºr den k√∂nnte dieses Spiel was sein.  Die hohe Komplexit√§t, grade mit den erweiterten Regeln, geben auf jeden Fall Wiederspielwert. Mir hats definitiv gefallen, aber ich bin auch Sci-Fi-Fan und habe gute Erinnerungen an das alte Spiel.

  This reprint of a forty year old game is still great and one of the best asymmetric strategy games - especially with higher player counts.  The only caveat that I would add is that the theme makes the game, and you need players familiar with the books who can explain and engage anyone who hasn't read the books in the backstory.

For beauty mainly, but very hard to play with it! Does not work right! It's just a nice decoration.
","

  For beauty mainly, but hard to play with, since pieces/checkers don't slide and get stuck on fabric stiches & vinyl triangles, and have no finger groove s hence they are too slippery for hand grip or sliding by finger. The box sides are too low  and dices jump out often.  It looks nice, but for those of you who really want to relax and enjoy playing it will be annoying, as it takes an extra effort and caution to play compared to the simply wood ones. So as a decoraion to be shelved it's OK, but as to actually playing with it I would avoid it.  Obviously the Chinese manufacturer is not a savvy backgammon player...

  This arrived ahead of time bus few days.Very well packaged and pulling the case from the box was exciting. My kids have never seen such a game, and actually thought I had made up the name and the game until it came.My only gripe is that the seams on the board are not tight and appears to come untucked. The chips/checkers are slippery but most game pieces are made this. As a kid, I played with checkers board pieces to make it easier to grab. I might do the same for this one.This is great as a travel game. And just like I had enjoyed the game so are my kids and I'm sure this will be our new add on travel game.

Fun game if you like cooperative games and don't mind cheap components
","

  This review might be a little long; but I hope it is helpful.  Yet, if you just want the bottom line, here it is: this is a fun, easy to learn and to fun play game for the whole family, provided that (a) you like ‚Äúcooperative games‚Äù and (b) you don‚Äôt mind lower quality components.  Now for more details:In this game, each player plays as a different character (with different special abilities) trying to help a village survive attacks from any number of several ‚Äúclassic‚Äù monsters while trying to complete certain tasks needed to defeat the monsters.  As in all cooperative games, the players play together against the game itself.  They can all win by meeting the winning conditions or lose in a number of different ways.  The game is similar to another cooperative game called Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu, which is excellent but which did not get a lot of attention when it came out.  Reign of Cthulhu, however is a hard game and you are likely to lose more often than not.  In Horrified, it is much easier to control the difficulty level and it is not difficult to win when played against certain combinations of two monsters.  The game can be set to a higher difficulty level by adding monsters or by selecting the monsters that offer more of a challenge to defeat.  Horrified also does a slightly better job than Reign of Cthulhu in driving the theme of the game across.  There are a lot of thoughtful little details in Horrified that those of you who have watched the classic horror movies will recognize (from the names of the Villagers, to the items the players collect to defend against, and attack, the monsters, to illustrations in some of the cards, etc.)  Also, not everyone is familiar with the Cthulhu stories, but everyone (even younger kids) is familiar with Frankenstein‚Äôs monster, the Wolfman, the Mummy, Dracula and the other monsters in this game.  A game with four players should take about one and a half hours, which I think is perfect for a family game.  All in all, I have enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it again with different combinations of monsters.Unfortunately, the game is not perfect and the biggest negative for me is the low quality of the components.  The cards are really flimsy. You will want to sleeve them if you are going to play the game a lot, which adds a cost to the cost of the game.  But the most disappointing is the quality of the monsters‚Äô mini figures.  They are made of cheap molded plastic.  When I opened my copy of the game, I noticed the mummy had been in the box pinned under the weight of other components and was bent over looking like it was falling over.  Dracula is also bending forward a little bit (looking like he is hovering over someone with this cape).  I contacted  Ravensburger and they graciously agreed to send me a replacement.  But because they sent it in an envelope, the poor mummy was again crushed along the way and the replacement was in even worse condition than the original (see the photo).  It barely stands up.  I am not going to return the game because of a crappy figure, but being a big player in the board game market, Ravensburger should know better.  Lastly, with so many cardboard pieces and the fragile figures, the box really needs a good insert that would let you organize the components and keep the figures from getting crushed.  I now spend a lot of attention at how I place the figures back in the box because I am afraid they will bend while the game is not in use.  I own at least one other Ravensburger game, by the way, so I am not trying to pick at them.  On the contrary, I am saying they are a good company (and their customer service is great) which is why I am surprised at the low quality of the components in this game which I think will be a very popular game.I don't mind owning both Reign of Cthulhu and Horrified, but if you already own and love Cthulhu and play it often, this one might be redundant.  But if you are looking for a more accessible theme, particularly for younger players, and particularly around Halloween, you want to consider Horrified.The Good:‚Äì Great theme‚Äì Fun and easy to play, easy to learn‚Äì Good for adults and children alike‚Äì Just about the right length playing time‚Äì High replayability value because you can create different combinations of monsters to play against‚Äì Easy to control the difficulty level‚Äì Can be played soloThe Bad:‚Äì Fragile monster figures‚Äì No box insert‚Äì Low quality paper cards

  I don't even know where to start...if you're a casual fan of the old Universal Monster movies like Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman Creature From the Black Lagoon and others, then you'll like this game. The monsters are on the loose in a village and you have to save the villagers by working together with the other players. Adults and kids will like it, and it does get just a little tense at times, but you can decide how hard or easy to make the game before you start.HOWEVER...if you are a super geek (like me) when it comes to these films you will LOVE THE HECK out of this game. There are so many nice little touches to evoke memories of the great catalog of Universal monster movies from the '30's, '40's  and '50's it would be hard to point out the best. Hmmm...nope, I can point out the best; as soon as you open the box you're greeted with...nah, I can tell you, but I won't. I don't want to ruin the nice little surprise. You will smile.This game was obviously a labor of love, and playing it is a total blast.

  We picked this up by recommendation from a friend. So glad we did!I liked it could be played with 2 player rules but can expand to 5 players. That way we can play as a couple or with our game night pals.The best part of this turned based strategy game was that one player plays the dinosaurs, which really just want to eat the other characters.The other player (or players) play familiar characters from the movie that all have specific skills (like distracting the dinos by screaming and sneaking way, or rescuing your friends, etc). There are two ways to win. The people win if they can get a couple of their group off the island via the helicopter pad (some sacrifices must be made for the better good) or the dinosaurs win by... you guessed it... eating delicious intruders.The game board is random and the characters switch out, which meant that each play was unique so there is a high replay value.We had a blast :)

Love the Universal Monsters theme and the ""Pandemic"" / ""Forbidden"" style? You absolutely need this.

  The Universal Monsters theme is put to great use in this co-op board game. Replayability is high with each monster having unique abilities and players having to solve mini game-like challenges (i.e. smashing 4 coffins before taking on Dracula or guiding a boat along a path to find the Creature's lair, etc).We've played this with 3 people and it flowed well. The learning curve is moderate. Helps if you've played other co-op games like Pandemic or the Forbidden series. Took about an hour to complete. Also has a solo game play option in the manual.We have the original Pandemic and the 3 Forbidden games. I'd put this one up there at the top of my list of co-op games. Only difference and reason I might grab Forbidden Island or Desert is because the play time is shorter than Horrified.Buy this game.

He always chooses to play as the three dinosaurs, and the rest of our family gets to choose from different characters from the movie.  It's kind of fun to choose a character that you don't mind getting eaten (Nedry!!), knowing you get to 'respawn' as a different character. Only gripe is that I found it at Target over the holiday weekend for half the price!!  Otherwise, fantastic strategy game.

Great Game with Flavor of Universal Horror
","

  Played this for the first time today, and we LOVED it!  It was great fun, required considerable strategy, and had the flavor of an old horror movie, with the monsters chasing the characters and villagers all around the board.  We managed to eek out a win at the starter level, and will be playing this _many_ times in the future.  With so many monsters, there are plenty of variations and challenges to come.  Did I mention that the components are great, too?  They are!  A treat for any fan, this game is sure to be a favorite for all Monster Kids and gamers!  A _must own_ for lovers of Universal Horror!

This JAWS co-op game takes a bites out of other games!
","

  I really just became Ravenburger's favorite board gamer. My family plays A LOT of board games. We just love them. We can hardly decide on a movie or tv show that everyone agrees on, but board games are our great neutralizer. We have enjoyed co-op games in the past with such favorites as Pandemic and Forbidden Island, but none have the nostalgic feel and visualization as being in a Ravensburger game.JAWS is an excellent game. It mixes strategy with the luck of the dice. The gameboard graphics take you to Amity Island and Quint's Orca ship. The playing pieces- cards, tokens, beachgoers, and wooden ships-shark-and players are top-notch. The premise of the game is fun and fair to both the shark and the characters. The game may be a bit difficult for newcomers to co-op games but I must say that these directions are excellently written and are presented in a nice and thorough and clear sequence.Note: Ravensburger games do not come sealed in cellophane. Rather, they are taped closed.Suggestions for Ravensburger: Make the board a little bigger as such beautiful graphics on this gameboard should be displayed in a bigger format. Also, beachgoers should have a little beach container to be sunning in waiting for their turn in the ocean to possibly encounter The Shark.Note to Ravensburger: I volunteer to be a future game tester for you. I truly love your games!!!!

  Work together as a team to defeat classic horror monsters. Horrified features classic Universal monsters such as Frankenstein's monster, his bride, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Dracula, etc. You choose your villain, and the number of monsters you'd like to defeat. Each monster has it's own unique features, challenges and attack rating. During game play, you must collect items to complete tasks and defeat monsters. Guide villagers to safety, and complete puzzles. Each Hero (player) has their own unique special actions/advantages.It's more complicated to learn than the average board game, but don't be intimidated. It's well worth learning. It's meaty, it's strategic, and it's a guaranteed hit. It's also a refreshing change of pace to be working with your fellow players, rather than competing with them.

  Weither you game often or not at all this is one for the collection. Not only does it look bad ass on the shelf, it's fun and easy to learn too!We are casual gamers here, I got this because it's one of the few two player games out there that looks somewhat dynamic. The game play is about an hour with two people. It offers a single player mode I've yet to try but I like that it is playable solo!The general concept of the game is you choose your character (a hero) then choose two or more iconic monsters depending on your difficulty, to take on as you save your village and villagers before they completely terrorize (there's a terror ""counter"" similar to the haunt counter in betrayal) or kill the heros! Each monster has a game card that has a specific task you must complete before the monster becomes vulnerable to attack which I thought was a fun spin. You get 4 actions in any order you choose each turn (pick up, trade, move, attack, special card or action) and after each players turn it's always the monsters turn! You gotta be careful because the villagers will spawn at random depending on the card drawn to which you have to return them safely to their rightful location before the monsters get them! If a monster gets them, the terror counter goes up and they die, if the monster get you, the terror counter goes up but you're sent to the hospital on the board. If that terror counter reaches it's max, you loose. If the monsters action card draw deck gets depleted, you loose. You win if you defeat the monsters before that happens!Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is because the mini figs of the monsters are cheaply made, most came bent and kind of warped but all other pieces are quality and will last many game nights. I just wish the mini figs were better quality as they're a really cool features to the game.

  I was very pleased with this game. I've been an avid tabletop and board gamer for 30 of my 40 years, and I love strategy, tactics, and roleplaying. My wife enjoys playing games, but is definitely what you would call a casual gamer. So, often the games I love are too complicated for her tastes. We've played two games of 'Horrified,' one on the novice setting (two monsters) and one on the standard setting (three monsters). During both games we had a blast!Presentation/ Subject Matter: 5/5. The game looks fantastic. The artwork is beautiful and the layout of everything is easy and intuitive, and c'mon, who doesn't love the Universal Monsters?Quality: 5/5. The colors are vibrant and all the components feel durable. Nothing looks or feels cheap. The minis are nicely detailed and the cardstock is heavy weight and substantial.Rules: 5/5. Very clearly written and laid out, with quick reference cards. The game seems well play tested and nicely balanced. A challenge, but not frustrating.Replay value: 5/5. With many different monster combinations, this game has lasting potential, and isn't repetitive.Strategy level: 3/5. While the strategy and tactics aren't going to blow away seasoned gamers, it's complicated enough to hold their interest, while being easy enough to understand easily for casual gamers.Overall: 4.8/5. A very pleasant gaming experience. Highly recommend! Kudos to the designers for a job well done!

There is a Learning Curve
","

  There is a learning curve with this game (seriously... it comes with a web address that you go to for game tutorial), and I watched a few YouTube videos to figure out how to play it.  After we punched out the billion game pieces, and we were several pages in on the instruction booklet on How to Set Up the Game for Game Play, my kids lost interest and abandoned me at the table.  We invested at least 90 minutes, and we have not played the game once.  Every now and then, I ask ""Want to try Horrified again?"" and there is just a chorus of ""Noooooo"".  I gave it two stars because I think the game is really well made. Also I don't think it is Ravensburger's fault my kids didn't want to invest any time learning a new game.  They want something that you learn in a few minutes and can play right away with little set-up.  If that is the kind of game you are looking for, I highly recommend Ravensburger's Labyrinth!  That is our favorite by far!

  We love this game! It's way more challenging than I thought. It's really hard for the humans to win. We haven't accomplished it yet. I thought it was going to be a baby/kids game, but it's more for adults and older kids. It's a cooperative game like Pandemic. I would say it's my favorite cooperative game so far. I looked on YouTube for an easy howto. Only took a few minutes to learn, however there are some complex rules. Make sure you know them all.The pieces and cards seem to be good quality. The people and dinosaurs are made of wood.

  This is a nice family weight, 1 vs many game with excellent theming, easy gameplay, and simple, but solid components.  One player plays all the dinosaurs trying to eliminate 3 characters (there is no player elimination).  The other player(s) play one or more characters (pick from 10 roles) trying to escape the island.  Dr. Alan Grant, or Ellie Sattler, or Ian Malcolm, or even the kids, Tim and Lex.  Each has their own goal and special deck of action cards.  As the dinosaurs attack, the characters lose cards, until they have none to play, at which point they are eliminated.  The player plays a new character.  Depending on team size, the human players need to get 2 or more characters with their goals to the helicopter.  The humans must first successfully turn on the systems in three locations -- the visitor center (return 2 cards to your hand), the maintenance station (turn on the electric fences), and the control center (lockdown all three locations to keep out dinosaurs).  When all three have been activated, the helicopter is called and available for the human players' win condition.  This game uses really nice art from the movie, has easy to read cards that look great and cool dinosaur meeples that move around the island.  For ~$20, this game is a great value and loads of fun playing either side.

  Horrified is reminiscent of traditional board games in that it involves the movement of tokens along pathways.  What makes it significantly different is that most of the action is driven by strategy instead of the randomness of dice rolls.  Players decide how the monster-fighting heroes will proceed, and, after each hero's offensive action, a card is drawn that details the possible counter-offensive of the monster(s).  Cards also indicate when and where villagers and weapons will appear.  The level of difficulty can easily be controlled by the number and type of monsters added to the game.  Oddly, the rules state that a solitary player should use only one hero when there is actually no difficulty involved in a sole person conducting the game with multiple hero tokens.A 15-page, 7 1/2"" X 10"" instruction booklet is included, which first advises one to watch a video to learn how to play.  (The indicated web address  brings one to the company's retail site, which has no indication of such a video.)  Luckily, the hard-copy helps are uncomplicated and easy to comprehend.  One contradictory-sounding statement does appear under ""Items"":  ""Only one Item of the color shown may be played per action"".  Then, ""Any number of Items of the color shown may be played in a single action."" (?)  [The latter is what actually happens in game play.]As usual, there are several non-company online videos available to explain and provide playthroughs of the game.  It just seems that a standard board game should come with a basic walkthrough written in the instruction booklet and not rely on the internet as a significant supplement.All in all, the game offers fun, straightforward play that does not lend itself to conundrums of procedural rules and questions concerning the allowance of various maneuvers.  Players have a limited number of chances to either dispatch or neutralize the menacing monsters, so the length of the game cannot be protracted.  Easy-to-follow instructions are printed on every card used in play, making it unnecessary to remember a plethora of rules.  It's simple enough for children and challenging enough for adults.  Highly recommended!

  I'm not a fan of ""coop"" type games.  Most are designed in such a way that an ""alpha"" gamer type will usually surface and bend everyone else to their will.  That doesn't happen so much with Horrified.  Somehow, they've managed to design a game that discourages that style of play while being fun.  It's currently the only coop game I'll willingly play.  As a bonus it has a solo mode that's excellent.The theme is very well done and integrated into the game play - a rarity in this age of pasted on themes.  The graphics and game play evoke the feel of the old Universal horror movies with tension from chasing, or being chased by, the monsters.  It's very easy to learn as well as teach making it a very good choice for group gatherings or times when you want to play a game but most of the people present are just not ""heavy"" gamer types.  With a maximum of 5 players it's not a true ""party game"" but works quite well in such settings.I've played a half dozen games solo and 4 more with 1 or 2 other players.  Games were done with the recommended ""easy"" variant (2 monsters) for the first game or two but quickly moved to ""standard"" (3 monsters) as we quickly figured out 2 monsters is a cake-walk.  Fighting 3 monsters is better but we've not yet lost a game and none have been in danger of being lost.  With that in mind, we feel 3 monsters is great for novice players as long as they have a more experienced gamer as a guide.  Our next game will be with 4 monsters.  The solo game feels just a bit more difficult than with more players but not significantly so.Due to the recommended random monster and hero pulls you can get lots of variety in the games.  We've yet to find a hero combo that's just not that good, even with the ""lesser"" ones.  Some of the heroes almost feel overpowered (especially one who can ""bounce"" around the board at will as a special power).The biggest con I have is the quality of the miniatures.  While they *look* good they're rather cheaply made.  Something along the line of a cheaper plastic army guy.  Several of ours came bent.  While this can easily be fixed it's the cheap, thin, plastic that's the ultimate cause.  The player pieces and ""villagers"" are standees (and really should have been plastic as well).  I'm not a fan of standees.  However, these are thicker cardboard and fit tightly into their stands.  As long as you put them in their base and leave them alone I don't foresee any issues.The box really needs a better insert to properly hold the various components.  It's OK but just OK.  You'll want to bag some things and sleeve the cards.  At least the card storage part of the box is large enough to accommodate sleeved cards.Player/hero boards, items, and standees are thicker cardboard and there's a nice velour type drawstring bag for the items (they're put on the board via blind draw).  The monster ""boards"" are the thickness of a standard playing card.  It'd have been nice if these, too, were cardboard.  The cards for the game are fairly standard playing card style - no linen finish (and you'll want to sleeve them for easier shuffling).The solo mode is very fun and requires only slight changes for play.  Essentially there's a hero you don't use and 2 ""perk"" cards you either remove or just draw again should they surface during play.  No ""automa"" player/setup/guide needed.  It plays identically to multi-player games.4 stars as experienced/eurogamer types may find it a bit simplistic and too easy at the ""standard"" level and several of the components could be better.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun family or gateway game.

My favorite co-op game so far...
","

  We love this game!  It is different every time you play and it ranges in difficulty.  The game is beautiful and very detailed.  We played with a large range of ages, 8-40-years old.  The adults seemed to enjoy it more because we took the strategy-part very seriously -- nobody made a move without first confirming with the group.  We lost a lot of times, and kept trying over a long-weekend until we finally beat 4 monsters at once (highest difficulty).  My youngest enjoyed being in charge of setting up and putting everything away (there are a lot of pieces).  The set up takes time, and there is a booklet you have to read before you can play.  Plus, the set up is different each time depending on what monsters you decide to fight.  That might annoy people who like to just open a box and quickly start playing.  The kids enjoyed the game for awhile and then started to get a little bored.  This was partly due to the adults wanting to discuss multiple strategies between each turn.  The teenagers in our group started playing on their phones while waiting for their turn, which doesn't work because it is a co-op game, so you have to pay attention and work together during each turn.  I liked that feature the most because even when it isn't your turn you still get to help the other player(s).  The best part about this game or any co-op game is that you all work together.  You win together or you lose together.  This is great in a family setting, especially if there is a wide disparity in ages.  It puts all of us on a level playing field.  I highly recommend this game!

  I'm a board game nerd.  I'm also a horror nerd.  This game is like a match made in heaven.  It combines the lore and aesthetic of the Universal Monsters with a fun cooperative board game that's simultaneously quick and easy to learn and yet adaptable enough to have high re-play ability.The mechanics are pretty simple and well-designed.  It's somewhat reminiscent of Pandemic in terms of both its cooperative nature and in terms of its mechanics.  One of the lovely things about it is that it can be set up in about five minutes, the rules can be learned in another five, and yet there are numerous combinations of monsters--each of which has its own unique abilities and tasks--that make the game different enough on replay to be fun every time.The components are primarily cardboard (though the monsters are plastic tokens), but you can tell great care was paid in assembling everything from the unique mechanics for each monster right down to the artwork on the cardboard pieces.  Fans of the Universal Monsters will feel right at home while playing this game.Admittedly, it will probably only really appeal to fans of the old Universal horror movies.  The game itself, while certainly a good game, doesn't offer any massive innovations.  But if you are a fan of monster movies, whether you're a board game player or not, you really need to get a copy of Horrified.

Fantastic family game (for all ages)!
","

  I have played a lot of games. My recommendations for an introductory family game used to be Castle Panic or Forbidden Island. Both are still very good, but Horrified is even better. It works for people who have never played a modern board game before, as well as those like me who have played hundreds of titles.All of the games I mentioned are ""cooperative"" games, where everyone either wins together, or loses together. I love that concept, and it's a great way for a family to bond rather than competing. Horrified puts you in a town that is being terrorized by classic Universal monsters, and you have to save villagers and defeat the monsters.One thing that sets Horrified apart is that each monster is unique. To defeat Dracula, you have to use red items to smash 4 coffins in the corners of the board, and then go to where Dracula is and use yellow items to kill him. To defeat the Creature from the Black Lagoon, you play items to advance a boat in a mini-game that resembles Candy Land. Once the boat is at the end, you can move to where the creature is, and defeat it by discarding one item of each color. Each of the other monsters is distinct like that, with their own mini-game. Since you typically face 2-3 of the monsters each time you play, and you choose from multiple heroes with special abilities, each session feels very different.I have played Horrified with about 10 people, of varying levels of gaming experience, and everyone has enjoyed it. It's easy to learn, and takes under an hour to play. It works great with anywhere from 2 to 5 players.

  If you have never played pandemic then Horrified sets up similar to that game where you're gathering resources to bring to a central point to accomplish a goal. The goal in this game being to defeat the Universal Studio Monsters.What works here is the theme, I love anything horror related, and the monsters are in the spooky range that the theme wouldn't frighten young children. Fans of the old films will even recognize an appearance from Abbot and Costello as Wilbur and Chick from Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein.Setup takes seconds, as does explaining the game, and as simple as it may seem I have seen seasoned tabletop gamers get surprised how quickly things can turn pear shaped.Absolute fun, I would suggest this be in everyones collection.

Unique, cool game
","

  This is a truly unique experience.  I am a huge fan of Jaws, and when I found out there was a Jaws game that had multiple phases of game play - where you start out trying to protect people on the beach, and then a second stage where you work to defeat Jaws, I had to get it.I really like the unique game play.  I personally think I like it most as a 2 player game, but it seems meant for 4, as a 3 v 1 game in 4 player mode which is different than most games I play.The components are nice, but not great (although I enjoy the meeples immensely), but I wish the game board was nicer - it is just thin and cheap, and a nicer game board would have done wonders since there really isn't all that much to this game (the board is small, so a nice, thick game board would have been amazing).The only downside for me is that it's game play is limited by the multiple players vs one.  I am not a big fan of that, but if that is fine by you then you will enjoy this game (I would not really ever want to play with 3 people even if they say you can).This game has good replay-ability and won't feel the same every game, even though it will always be similar, so you can break it out every once in a while and it will still feel fresh and fun.  It really does feel like you are a part of the movie.

  I gifted this game to my horror-fanatic boyfriend for his birthday. We both LOVE it! We've had it for about a month and a half and have probably played 10+ times. There is definitely a learning curve -- I recommend watching the Watch It Played video about this game like two times before starting -- but once you get it, it is actually pretty easy to understand. The variety of monster combos always gives you a different experience, and I love the fact that it is cooperative, which feels rare with board games. Game play is about an hour, give or take. Granted, we are both in our 20s, so I am not sure how a younger kid would fare with this (both for complexity and length of gameplay), but if you're up for it, it is a great time, every time.A fun bonus is that, if you want to, you can paint the minifigures. Just get a nice set of microbrushes and some acrylics of your choice and go to town. It was a nice date activity, and adds to the ambiance of the game!

  This game is great. It brings up the nostalgia of all the original horrors from Universal studios and lets you play out scenarios in this game.  The game is very easy to learn and lots of fun. You will get many scenarios and be able to live out hunting Vampires or the mummy. I would say kids can play this game as it's not too bloody or anything.

(Edited) Love this game. Thought of a new difficulty setting while playing
","

  I love Horrified and I‚Äôve been playing it for awhile trying different monsters and heroes. At the moment I have only played alone so I haven‚Äôt had a chance to play with friends. Still it is fun and challenging game that I highly recommend.First I must say that Horrified is, in many respects, very similar to another popular co-op game Pandemic. In Pandemic you try to cure diseases whereas in Horrified you are trying to defeat the classic Universal Studios Monsters. What makes it different from Pandemic is that each monster must be defeated in a different way, but all of them requires turning in color items. For example to defeat Dracula you need to destroy 4 coffins (each 1 at a different location) with red items and then use yellow items to defeat Dracula. The game also introduces villagers that you must protect or ,if killed by a monster, the village Terror track rises bringing you closer to losing the game. In my personal opinion, I do like Horrified a little bit more than Pandemic for a couple reasons:1. Each monsters unique way of defeating them2. The theme itself.3. It offers solo play. I don‚Äôt have many friends to play with and I have trouble getting friends to play this game, so I‚Äôm happy the game offers a solo mode with few changes that doesn‚Äôt severely hurt gameplay experience. Plus it feels awesome to defeat the monsters and  save villagers on your own.There aren‚Äôt any problems I can think of with the game except maybe the villagers. I really like the villagers in the game, but the issue can be that when they are played they always spawned at the same location. Often locations fit from which they spawn, but the more you play the more you remember the locations they spawn in. Thus you can prepare when they are played. Great for players but doesn‚Äôt offer much variety. Only suggestion I can think of to remedy this is dice (any kind) that equals the number of locations on the board each being assigned a number. That way the villagers can spawn in different locations.While playing the game, I have thought of another difficulty setting you can play which I call ‚ÄúVan Helsing.‚Äù The maximum difficulty is 4 monsters but instead add a 5th, 6th, or all 7 of the monsters. Game plays normally with these differences:1.Do 2 rounds with the monster deck2. If any villagers die in the 1st round and are drawn again in the 2nd round, do not play them on the board. Instead place 2 items instead of the normal 3 from villager events.3. For 2-5 players: start with 4 (maybe 5) items in your inventory so players don‚Äôt get killed easily by one or more monsters at the start of the game. Solo: start with no items.I did actually do this solo with all monsters and manage to win. Not sure how great this would be for 2-5 players but it might work. Give this a try if you like. Otherwise, Horrified is great to have if you like co-op, Pandemic, and horror like games and would be great to play during the Halloween season.

  This is a fun game that I enjoy for the collaborative aspect. To play alongside my friends to defeat the bad guys is a lot of fun. My only recommendation is for there to be an add-on pack with additional bad guys. I do have a question regarding traveling with villagers- if you‚Äôre a hero that can transport yourself via your special ability- does that allow you to bring villagers with you? Also, if a monster card or ! requires a hero to move spaces or go to the same space as a monster, if they were transporting villagers, do those villagers move with the hero or not? I wish the instruction manual answered those questions. Otherwise, it‚Äôs a fun and challenging game. I do appreciate the ability to play it as a solo player.

  Horrified is my favorite board game that I've played in years. Partly because I'm a movie nerd and very fond of the Universal monsters, and partly because it's just a lot of fun. The huge number of combinations of monsters and characters makes every play-through slightly different (and some of them are haaaaard‚Äîtry the Invisible Man and the Creature from the Black Lagoon in the same game with a third monster‚Ä¶ you just burn through items).So. Much. Fun.

A New Favored Game
","

  Bought this to play with the family on Halloween and it was a big hit.Replayability is huge, there are some randomizing elements and you can pick various combinations of monsters and heroes that lead to very different games.The craftsmanship is extraordinary as well, you can feel the quality in every component you handle.Overall just an amazing game, I play a lot of board games and this is becoming a favorite. I like that it is co-operative but at the same time, you can stab a sibling in the back. Huge plus for me.

Great game, especially for horror buffs.
","

  I have played this game three times with three different groups.  The first was 2 player on the intro level which we won, and two four player games on harder levels, one we almost won and one we did okay at.  All three groups enjoyed it.The gameplay is fairly easy, and once everyone has a turn or two it all makes sense, even for non-gamers.  It is fairly thematic which helps understanding rules.  I like that each monster has its own weakness and strength, and can change gameplay.  There is a bit of randomness, but not too much.I have other friends who I think will enjoy playing, can't wait to try again!

Entry level 1 vs all hidden move game
","

  Not the best 1 vs all hidden move game for sure, compared to fury of Dracula, letters from whitechapel, or Spector ops. I can see it‚Äôs meant to be family friendly game, or people who love the shark movie, not for hardcore gamers. Theme wise, it really follows the movie plot and characters, arts are great as well. Basic rules are simple not much strategic, but with quite some fiddly small tiny rules that are easy to miss. Components quality is just ok, I think they can definitely use thicker cardboard. But for $12, it‚Äôs still worth trying and see if you like it. But I wouldn‚Äôt buy if it‚Äôs more than $20

Not a well thought out game
","

  My son wanted this game so we got it for Christmas. It took over 3 hours to read through all the directions, learn the strategies and objectives, learn the plays, and then execute the game. After playing it with my son I can tell you this game is a yawn fest. There's too many things to do that you get bored, and then you have to flip the board over at some point and set up the 2nd part of the game in order for it to end. Honestly, my son likes it because he's a kid pretending to be a shark. As an adult, this is just not captivating. Whoever designed this game didn't make it simple enough to enjoy.

Challenging game with a great range of difficulty levels and high re-play value
","

  This game requires strategy and cooperation.  And it is FUN!  The difficulty level is scalable by adding additional monsters to the board.  The random nature of the monster mix, hero mix and attack dice rolls gives the game high re-play value.  Love the Universal classic horror tie-in.  Note, however, that the several pages of rules are pretty much required reading.  Would love to see Phantom, Hunchback and Hyde added to the monster ranks as an expansion pack.  If going outside Universal ouvre, would also love to see a Dr. Phibes monster.  My 13yo and I love it.  GREAT GAME!!

A Lot of Fun to Play
","

  I played this game at a friend's house, and had so much fun playing it, I bought it for myself.  My friends and I play it every time we have game night.  It's not difficult to learn how to play.  It has difficultly levels depending on how hard you want the game to be.  You have to have a minimum of 2 monsters, but can have up to four monsters if you want it at the hardest level.  You can also play the game solo or up to five people total.  The players play the game together as a group to beat the monster together.  If you like strategy games, I recommend this game.

Fantatastic game, but manufacturer issues

  The game is great, but the box was trashed. No damage was on the shipping box. So this is a problem with either warehouse damage or initial shipping from the manufacturer....who is still sealing games with tape circles and not shrink wrap, which damages the box(same as all the villainous games)

  We had a lot of fun once we figured out how to play. (Not sure if we are still playing totally correctly, but we tried). Pretty complicated with tons of crazy directions, but fun.

  I got this game for my daughter for Christmas. She was raised to appreciate and enjoy those great old Universal Studios classic monster movies. She and her friends enjoy this game very much. The difficulty level changes depending on the monsters you try to defeat, the number of them in the game and the number of people playing. As some reviewers have mentioned the cards aren't the greatest quality. So my daughter bought card sleeves. No big deal. All in all a fun game that has good replay value.

LOVE THIS GAME!!!!
","

  Fantastic game!!! As a huge fan of the classic Universal Monsters, I adored this game. The artwork is incredible, the villagers and monsters from the movies bring back nostalgic memories, and it‚Äôs super easy to learn. The single player mode is what I play the most of. Even still, it‚Äôs an absolute blast. The Archaeologist is always my go-to character when playing, certainly helps when it comes to fighting off 3+ monsters. The game does seem to get a little harder by not only adding more monsters, but more people as well since there are more rounds to go around until your next move. It also means less items to go around, but don‚Äôt mistake this as griping. That just requires more strategizing and teamwork to save the village! If you love co-op strategy horror games with great gameplay and superb artwork, please pick this up. You won‚Äôt regret it.

A great new cooperative game with a fun theme!
","

  Horrified is a great cooperative game!! Players are working together to defeat monsters from the old Universal movies, while also keeping the villagers in the town safe. The great part is the that there are 7 different monsters and each monster has completely different features, powers, and ways to defeat them. Depending on the difficulty you want, you can use any combination of 2-4 monsters per game, making it really high in replayability as the game is constantly changing by using different monsters. The game is pretty easy to pick up and learn out of the box. Turns are straightforward and the monsters all have a clear instruction mat to help you understand their powers and ways to defeat them. We played in just under an hour on our first time through and did manage to win on the recommended starter monster combination. But it took us 2/3 the way through the allotted turns to win, so we‚Äôll definitely have to get better as we start to move up to harder monster combinations. I think this one will definitely be a hit that  we‚Äôll reach for over and over!

You don't need to love Universal monsters to love this game
","

  I've never seen the movies this game is based on, but that hasn't stopped Horrified from becoming one of my top 5 favorite board games.This is a co-operative game where you move around the board collecting items that help you defeat a Universal monster.  Each of the six monsters has a different win condition.  Smash Draculas coffins, find a cure for the Wolfman, solve the Mummys curse, collect evidence of the Invisible Mans crimes, search the Black Lagoon for the Creatures hideout, and teach Frankenstein and the Bride how to love.  You mix and match 2 or 3 of these monsters each game.  Villagers that are characters from the movies will randomly pop up and give an opportunity for reward cards.  This, along with different player characters that have special abilities, provides a lot of variety.My only complaint is that there isn't even more of this game.  I would buy extra monsters for this game in a second.

My problem is with the description -"" High-quality wooden pawns, dice and dice cups for every player Contents: Deluxe game board 16 Wooden pawns 8 Dice 4 Dice cups Illustrated instructions""Notice the ""wooden pawns"" listed twice in the product description...They are NOT wood, they are plastic. We specifically purchased this set because we were looking for the wood pawns. Not the case in this instance. So we are sending it back to try again. If this isn't something you really cared about, then this set is nice otherwise and I would recommend it. But I think the seller needs to update their product description.

Good classic game of strategy
","

  Great game, much like the old game of Sorry, where each player's four pawns race around the board trying to get to Home base before their opponent does.  Parcheesi is a bit more challenging than Sorry.  In Parcheesi, a player can move pawns separately on each throw, based on the numbers that turn up on the two dice, as opposed to Sorry which uses a draw pile, revealing one card at a time to move one pawn around the board.  There is a stronger component of strategy in Parcheesi than Sorry (which is pretty much 90% chance, making it a better game for very young players).  There are added bonus moves in Parcheesi, as well, adding to the fun.  Sometimes I remember to take my bonus moves after capturing my husband's pieces and sometimes I don't, which is infuriating.  This is our new favorite game, and by the way, the pieces are well constructed and sturdy, not cheap or chintzy as a previous reviewer noted.  Good game, takes about 30-40 minutes to play with two people.

  It's just like when I was a kid with two tiny exceptions. 1) the pawns are plastic but they are the correct shape as in the photo. 2) there are tiny arrows on the board to show you where the pawns enter and which direction to go. That will reduce confusion and is an improvement. All else is exactly like I remember, even the dice getting stuck in the cups. I may just buy some dice without rounded off corners so they don't jam as others have mentioned. I also may fill in the pawns with some weights while I'm at it. But all in all I'm very happy.

They need to go back to a 2 fold game board like the original game was years ago. VERY POOR DESIGN  I returned both games.

  I played this game as a child and was very happy to find it on Amazon.  This is a great game for adults, but I specifically bought it for  my 5-year-old grandson.  He loves the game.

Just a bunch of Hocus Pocus fun!
","

  üîÆ ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a bunch of HOCUS POCUS!‚Äù üîÆOur family ran amok, amok, amok, amok, trying to stop the Sanderson Sisters from creating their potion. The instructions are a little complicated, but once we got a hang of the game it was very fun & easy! Definitely a must have for a family with kids 7 & up especially if y‚Äôall love the movie. The objective is to work together to ruin the Sanderson Sisters‚Äô potion 3 times so the sun comes up on the witches board. You take turns changing the potion in the cauldron until you can stun a witch. However their magic prevents you from sharing your hand so you have to ask each other questions instead.Questions like:‚ÄúDo you have any _________ color cards?‚Äù - Asking only if the have a certain color.‚ÄúDo you have any Oil of Boil?‚Äù -Asking only if they have a certain ingredient.So one person asks a question & everyone answers yes or no. Then the person that asked the question lays down one card from their hand & picks up a new ingredient card. You take turns doing that until you can stun one of the witches. Once you get a certain set it will stun a particular witch & the sun is closer to rising. If you run out of ingredient cards before the sun rises (playing 3 rounds) then the Sanderson Sisters have won. There is other things that adds/changes up the game a bit like spell cards, Binx mover, & trick tokens. I added pictures of the instructions because they are long & detailed. I also added a set of each witch stunned & other details. My girls are 8 & 13 years old. They both really enjoyed it. It‚Äôs not a long game, but would be fun to play multiple times in a row.

Terrible packaging and not worth more than $20.00

  The packaging was awful and had 3 little clear stickers holding the lid down.  They sent it in a padded envelope.  I am happy game box wasn't dented because the envelope was beat to hell.  No protective box of the board game and the game itself was not in plastic or anything else.  It is NOT worth more than the $20.00 it was originally listed at.  It is cute and looks like it will be fun and has really cute ideals like the actual game box is the spellbook, a little binx replica and some fun drawings on the cards.  Again,  do not pay more than the $20.00 it was originally sold at.  It is not worth more even if you are a super fan, which I am!

  Would agree with others who reported this game needs packaged to ship better. Mine also arrived damaged. Binx tail was broken off within the package. I did enjoy the idea of packaging the game to look like an actually spell book, but that's about all I liked about it. Game play is mediocre and my girls (12 and 8) lost interest quickly.

  The packaging is fun and the nostalgia is there. We were laughing at how cute everything was until we played.  We played this game with two people and twice we lost, hard. We were only able to stun the sisters one time and the goal is to do it three times. I want to try it again with more people and see if that makes creating the goals easier. It feels like it needs more ingredient cards to reach the goals. If you are a fan of the movie I would totally recommend, but the game play is just ok.

  So the concept is cool ""Stop the Sanderson Sisters from taking over the town!"".  But the execution is lacking. Instructions are nearly impossible to understand, so you end up frustrated.

Unlikely we will ever end up playing it again, which is a shame, because it looked so fun.

  We love the movie and as big board game fans, had to check this out. You and the other players try to defeat the Sanderson sisters by stunning them by making certain card combinations in the cauldron. If you fail, the Sisters suck the lives out of all the children of Salem! Once you play a round or two, the rules are easy to pick up. We played 8 time and the witches won five out of the eight.  I think it is easier for the witches to win due to the amount of ingredient cards you get. The more people you add, the harder it gets because you can only ask questions like ‚Äúdo you have a purple?‚Äù All in all, we enjoy this game.

  Some people are complaining about the packaging but it arrived in perfect shape and doesn‚Äôt need extra plastic or a box to come in.This game is hard! Three adults and we have played the game about 9 times now and only won twice following all the rules. Stunning Winifred is the same combination as stunning Mary but with another requirement so no one will ever stun her. I feel like the requirements should be unique for each witch. Some games we spoke freely and still didn‚Äôt get close to winning because of the ‚Äúluck‚Äù of the draw. Not sure how this combination of rules got by the game testers.The game is adorable and I love the details pulled from the movie. We will continue playing but probably create a new stunning requirement for Winifred and ease up the rules if playing with younger kids.Also the retail price is $19.99.

  OMG, we actually managed to defeat all three witches (not required in the game). You can defeat the same witch more than once so long as a witch is defeated three rounds. But my 7 year old put down the winning card that beat Winifred, because all ingredients are different but all in yellow. That's the hardest one to get, and I never thought beating Winifred would see the light of day. (Yes, I made a slick reference there üòÄ). We love this game. It's a more interesting and complex version of Uno. Definitely unique, and challenges the mind. So far we've only played 2-player. I'm not sure if more players would make this game easier or harder.

  Outstanding table presence and art IMO.  Our family (wife and 11 y/0 son) played twice the first night we had it.  Components are a cut above.  Very well done insert that easily accommodates all items.  Rule book is truly exceptional giving clear instruction through illustrations and a myriad of examples.  Card stock is good.  Rules are on the simpler side, but offers enough to keep coming back.  Dice rolling, while very luck driven, uses well done mechanics that can mitigate their effects through the use of acquired and applied resources (Masts, cannons).  Large tiles (6 of them) are printed on both sides and able to be changed so that the gameplay stays fresh.  Production value is wonderful with a (good) kickstarter like look without being over done and without the year wait and hope that it ships.  Feels like a passion project and I really enjoy it.  Ultra deep gameplay or rules aficionados should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a game that is relatively fast to the table, fun, and simple enough to attract non gamers but also offers great player interaction (threats, bribes, etc) and enough lite strategy for a veteran gamer, you will enjoy this.

Plunder (a pirate's life) finally delivers- it's the first game in forever I've bought that's actually HEAVY when it arrives.  The board is surprisingly huge, the design actually makes you feel like you're looking at ocean and ships (I'm looking at you $40 Catan seafarers- water isn't just WordArt blue and ships aren't triangles), and the gameplay backs it all up with accessible but interesting rules and mechanics.  My friends and I are only just starting to get the hang of it but I'm just so happy to actually feel like I got a game worth playing for once. Lots of fun and looking forward to playing this one more regularly.

Awesome game for the family.

  My nephews (11yr, 15yr) enjoyed Pluder: A Pirate's Life very much. We had such a good time playing it! The younger nephew was really impressed with the game art and really liked the ship pieces. The game play instructions were clear and easy to follow. After setting up the game which took about 3 minutes or so, we were ready to play. The game includes a spinner, or in this case a compass, which nowadays not many games have. The younger nephew quickly made sure he was in charge of the spinner. After about an hour of game play, the younger nephew came out victorious! It was highly competitive as the score was very close at the end. The ""Treasure Cards"" was one of our favorite features. When reading a ""Treasure Card"" players are encourage to talk like a pirate which made everyone laugh. I really enjoyed Plunder: A Pirate's Life and I could see myself playing with both younger and older crowds. I highly recommend!

Quality game pieces, easy to learn, multiple playing set ups.

  Loved this game.  Very impressed with the game pieces, very good quality.  Instructions very easy to read and understand.  Each game you play has a different board set up you can choose from making it a different game every time you play.  You can make it as cut throat or as easy as you want.  My family is a very big board gamer group (think serious Catan and Power Grid players) and will definitely be adding this into one of our go to games.  Game plays in a little more than an hour the first time we played and just under an hour the second time.  Game has instructions for solo play, but should be played 2-6 players.  We played with 4 players,  There are also instructions for team play.

Perfect board game, but...
","

  Plunder is an absolute joy to play, and the game came in perfect condition. Rules are simple and easy to follow. However, due to what I assume is a manufacturing error, the game came with two attack dice and one defense die (rather than one attack, one defense, and one sailing). This is not that big of a problem however because the dice only really have numbers on them and I just replaced one of the two red dice given with a spare white one that I own. Overall, very fun game that I will play over and over again with friends and family.

  This game takes Catan to a whole other level. If you enjoy Catan, you will love this game. The board and game pieces are awesome. The rule book is so easy to understand and if you forget a rule as you first play, it's easy to find in the rule book. We played for the first time last night and we forgot about one rule as we were playing which we think is part of the reason it took so long to play. We are going to play again today the right way and see how long it takes. You do want to play when you have plenty of time as, like Catan, it is a long playing game. But it was so much fun the time went by quickly. This game is a lot strategy, but also luck as when you battle you are depending on the roll of the die. I have 13 and 15 year old boys. They both love the fact that you can battle in this game to try and win islands or sink ships. I really can't say enough good things about this game. We LOVE it. Oh, and best thing, since there are a lot of pieces to this game, the last page of the rule book shows you how to pack everything back up in the box.

  ok ok nothing is better than an evening or two or three playing merchants & marauders but when youwant to stay on the same theme and have a blast, Plunder is the game.Easy to learn.Easy to play.Has some very nice touches that make it interesting for vets too.First one to 10 plunder points wins. sound familiar.player gets plunder points from owning ships, islands, and through card play.There are at least 3 treasures to find going in the game and huge storm thats changer on a roll of 1 of the sailing dice.player can fight other ships, fight and capture islands/ports on a map that changes each time you play.players can trade with other players depending on your location on the map.players can upgrade ships with more masts for extra movement, more cannons for extra combat points in battles.four sets of resource cards allow the player to 'build' the upgrades.excellent game. very surprised. i got it for my birthday. will see a lot of play time with family.

Fun Game for the beginner or advanced players
","

  The game is amazing, easy to learn yet hard to master. It is a mix of skill, planning and the luck of the dice and cards as you build up your fleets, sail around the map conquering islands, searching for treasure, gathering resources and battling your foes.The ships and pieces are very well made and durable. Each ship starts with 3 life pawns and can be upgraded with 2 masts and 2 cannons. The parts are solid and with not easily bend or break. The spinners, map pieces, and board are the standard, as expected, punched out cardboard. The board pieces are sadly the only pieces that I am concerned with, they interlock like a puzzle and even though they are durable they are sill just cardboard with an image overlayed on them. Meaning eventually I expect the ends to wear, bend, tear or break, my heart is already sad for the day this will occur :(No two games are the same with the myriad of options to choose from. You have a grid of 6 map tiles, each map tile can be used in one of its four directions, plus there is a second side, so each tile an option of 8 different layouts. Meaning you have a total of over 200,000 ways to layout your map.You start off your meager fleet with one ship and one island. You set a course for the randomly plotted 'X's which as ye all know to be treasure! The treasure can be a blessing or a curse but well worth the risk. Slowly you gather enough resources to build up your ship or maybe add a new one to the fleet. Once you feel ready you can set a course for an unclaimed isle and make her yours. Each owned island allots you one new resource card at the start of each round.You can choose to sail with diplomacy or with the Jolly Roger as your guide. You can work out deals and treaties with foes or barrage them with your freshly installed cannons. Sink their vessels as a way to gain ""plunder"" points, the goal is to be the first to reach a predetermined amount of plunder.The biggest thing I want to really to tell you about is the game makers care for the game, the tray has a location for EVERY single piece. They even take time to give you a page in the rule book about how to store your game properly ensuring the game will last for many sessions to come.  THANK YOU Lost Boy Entertainment!

An easy, engaging, fun, and robust game - highly recommend

  Wow!!!What a fun and engaging game!At first, I was concerned with the lengthy rulebook, but the game mechanics are so logical that the rulebook has a natural, breezy flow.This is a great ‚Äúgateway‚Äù game with enough play variety and a cool, inviting table presence (my wife was even interested when she saw it!) and I was able to explain the rules in about 2 minutes...again, because they are so logical and thematic - the gameplay explanation flows together and just makes natural sense...All the elements work well together from the card draw, dice rolls, to the spinners - these are the ‚Äúoriginal gansta‚Äù tools of the trade that make this game familiar and inviting to non-gamers...So, I‚Äôm really trying to think of a flaw - and I guess if I get picky, I might say the Plunder Points should be some kind of plastic token piece instead of a card set...maybe add a reference card for player turn actions and battle types/outcomes but that‚Äôs all I can come up with...As for game-play improvements...again, not much to add here...what I can envision is maybe a mini-expansion...maybe there is a Navy Patrol ship with its own die that makes life harder for all players by imprisoning crew lives, taking cards away, or liberating islands from pirates (think of Catan‚Äôs robber)...maybe the game designer can offer piece upgrades like the plunder point tokens previously mentioned...but again, I‚Äôm getting picky ‚Äî the game doesn‚Äôt really need it.I would recommend this game to people who want to have fun with others playing a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù game that offers a variety of actions to win. When I played, I found I was getting points in all ways possible depending on my available resources - so I was invading islands, fighting other players, and burying treasure as well as building and upgrading my ships - all to secure my lead and win the game...This game will hit the table again - highly recommend.

Real review! Not fake to pump up the ratings...
","

  I watched this game since it first came out and have kept an eye on the reviews, as there isn't a lot of information on the game. My first impression based on the reviews quickly popping up (one 5 star after another), was that someone's family and friends were making a lot of favorable comments in support of their loved ones new game. It's great to be supportive but as a buyer I want real information. Why is the game good? How does it scale? How is the quality, length and replayability? Is it worth $50? Will kids enjoy it? Is it any good?The game concept was intriguing enough that I decided to purchase it. The components are decent. The ships are great. Excellent quality. They are a little to big for the squares on the board so if you battle it will overlap, or you have to sit on two spaces. But that is not a big deal. The cards are very thin. A deck of generic cards are better in quality. For the price, I would have liked a linen finish but I suspect all the money went into the ships. It would have also been great to have some type of coin and resource cubes in place of the plunder and resource cards. But like I said, it looks like all the money went into the ships.The game itself leaves a lot to be desired. There is not much game at all. On your turn you draw resource cards equal to the number of islands you control, roll your die, take some actions. These actions could be moving your ship/ships, finding treasure, upgrading ships, battling a player or taking over an island. Unfortunately, you find most of your turn is spent floating around place to place and spending the easy-to-come-by resources. Battles are few and far between making the game somewhat dull, even with aggressive players. This didn't change as the number of players did. Replayability just isn't there. We played through almost all the treasure cards on our first game. There is nothing new to discover.It does have a cool element in which a storm moves around the board whenever you roll a one. But pay a few resources and you are out of it. Also, the rulebook leaves some loopholes to cheat the game making it far too easy without some house rules.  IF, they did an upgrade to fix some of the broken rules and battle issues this game could be really good but for what it is and what you get (a decent board, excellent ships and cheap cards) it is not worth $50.Plunder is a good, basic, starter game in the world of pirate themed games, or board games in general. I would recommend it for those with family's and younger children who like the concept without the ""take that"" aspect. If playing with kids I would reduce the number of required plunder points. It just takes to long and gets boring. For adult gamers, or medium to heavy gamers I would give this game a pass and seek out Black Fleet (the game this little guy is trying to be) Piratology (with an end game house rule) or Skull Tales: Full Sail (the rulebook sucks but there are some great tutorials online).Easy to learn but boring.

Great, Quality Game with Easy to Learn Gameplay
","

  I stumbled upon this game while looking for board games to help to pass the time and was immediately drawn to the art style of the board and the concept of a pirate-based game. Despite never hearing of it before, it seemed reasonably priced compared to other strategy games, so I figured ""why not.""After playing this game three times the night it arrived and three more times a day later, I can safely say that this game is absolutely worth it and a blast to play, especially 1v1. The goal of the game is relatively simple - acquire enough ""Plunder Points"" to become the greatest pirate before your opponent manages the same. These points are earned through purchasing them outright with Gold resources, building ships, conquering islands, finding buried treasure, and sinking your rivals' ships as you compete with one another. The art on the board pieces and resource cards is beautiful and very stylistic, with both being well made and durable. The rules are not too complicated and easy to pick up - we only had to reference the rules once during gameplay after reviewing them before the first playthrough. The included reference cards provide a quick, easy way of managing what you can purchase with your accumulated resources such as ship upgrades - masts and cannons for more maneuverability and attack power - extra lives, additional ships, or Plunder Points. The game pieces are hardy, and all of the extra pieces fit perfectly into their designated slot. Additionally, the map tiles are reversible with alternative layouts so that you can generate a different play area for each game to allow for a different experience each time.While the objective is to gain the 10 Plunder Points, players can choose various methods to attain this goal, meaning that no two playthroughs will end up the same. In the first run, I focused on combat by sinking my opponent's ship early and finding treasure spots to chase the win. During the next game, my opponent concentrated on taking over as many islands as they could to generate more resource cards for upgrades and direct purchases of Plunder Points to secure victory. Finding treasure can result in a boon of wealth and resources, or offer less beneficial effects such as gaining gold at the loss of wood, or force swapping cards with another player. The continually moving and random path of the Storm can also help or hinder, as you can try to force your opponent into the area or become stuck yourself. Similarly, moving treasure spots ensure that everyone has a chance at finding loot, though some players may end up lucky enough to wind up with multiple treasure spots in their immediate path. Not always hostile, player interaction can also be inspired by offering bribes to avoid being attacked, or trading resource cards towards mutual benefit. Depending on playstyle, and with a bit of random luck from dice rolls, our 2-player games have lasted from 20 minutes to an hour.Plunder: A Pirate's Life is an excellent addition to any household and is absolutely worth the investment. I'm looking forward to playing more, and this will definitely be a go-to game for our home.

Easy to Learn, Solid Strategy Game with Dynamic Gameplay
","

  I played this game with four other players (5 total), and we all had a very fun time. The rules are intuitive and easy to learn. The mechanics are great. You can build multiple ships, and upgrade ships with cannons for extra damage or masts for additional movement. There is a moving storm that you do not want your ships to be caught in. You can choose to be friendly with other players by trading, striking deals or staying out of their way. You can also do what one of my friends did and sink all of another player's ships at the start of the game. Unclaimed slands can be conquered, and you can take other players' islands as well. The board is random every time!The goal is to get 10 ""Plunder Points"". Each ship and island you own counts as one Plunder Point. You can find lost treasure or save up gold to get additional Plunder Points as well.What we especially liked is how quickly the tide can turn against someone who is just one turn away from winning. Three of us got up to 9 Plunder Points at various points throughout the game until the rest of us decided to (temporarily) cooperate together to bring down the top pirate. There was also plenty of good ol' pirate backstabbing, threatening, and parlaying üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èDefinitely a must-have if you want a solid strategy game with dynamic gameplay!

Plunder is fun-filled, high-quality, and swashbucklin'!
","

  Plunder: A Pirate's Life is an excellent board game to be enjoyed by everyone! There is room for both strategy enthusiasts and casual players just looking to have fun with friends. The gameplay consists of (1) sailing your pirate ships around, (2) searching for buried treasure, (3) combating other pirate ships & islands, (4) collecting resources (used to build & upgrade your fleet and to get victory points), (5) capturing islands, and (6) avoiding the ever-moving storm (all while maintaining your best pirate accent). Plunder is designed to be the most fun when you aim to play it with a pirate-like attitude/strategy, which goes to show a lot of thought has gone into the game design. That is to say, I have the most fun when I strategize to roll with what I am given, take advantage of situations as they arise, and expect an ounce of luck/chance to influence the game. In addition to the well thought out gameplay, Plunder excels in the quality of its production. All of the components are clearly well made (I especially like the weight and feel of the pirate ships) and you will notice this even in the weight of the box, which is notably heavy. The box states it takes 20 min per player for a game with 2-6 players being able to play. I have found this to be true for at least games with 2, 3, and 4 players (though I haven't played with 5 or 6 yet), with the necessary caveat that your first game will take a little longer to learn the rules.

If Catan + Risk had a baby...

  This game is awesome! My husband bought it by chance several months ago and we have now shown the game to all our friends many of which have bought their own sets. The quality of materials is nice and sturdy. The game itself is always changing so you must be an adaptable player who is willing to attack others to win. The only thing is that when the game has more than 4 players with several ships there are not enough life pegs to fill the boats so we have had to place canons and masts as lives in the past. Overall great game!

  This game is the pirate version of Catan! Your goal is to get to 10 Plunder points. You get to do this in a variety of ways- the most fun is stealing islands, building up your ship with cannons and masts and attaching other ships.The key to this game is letting go of winning and focus on attacking ships and stealing other players islands. And truly embracing the pirate life.Definitely worth adding to your board game collection. Perfect for friend an family game nights.

  If you call cards like, ""See the future, Crawl Inside a Goat Butt and See Many Wondrous Things,"" with a picture of someone's head looking out a goat's anus"" family friendly, then you might be happy with this game.

My 6year old picked it right up and love this game
","

  My 6year old picked it right up and love this game. I saw several reviews complaining about the card quality and how easily they get damaged. I have worked in the casino industry for years and have seen all different qualities of cards. I was a pleasantly surprised to find the card quality was not bad at all. Not top of the line by any means but plastic coated. I found the cards to be about the same size as Pokemon and Magic cards. Being a bit of a nerd I had lots of extra sleeves for my daughter and I's card collections. I sleeved the exploding kittens deck. It should last much longer that way. I highly recommend this game it's fun. I will be buying expansions soon.psYou can pick up Penny sleeves at any hobby shop that sells magic or Pokemon cards. They are very inexpensive and we'll make your game last much longer.

Incompatible with newer expansions, different card backs, and now loot bags...
","

  They keep releasing new cards with different card backs. Most recently they've released blind bags that include a cheap plastic molded toy and a card that's intended to be used with this game, but the back is different so you can't use it without putting every single card into card sleeves. They keep doing this too, I think there are at least 3 different card backs currently... There's absolutely no reason for this other than a money grabbing scheme. This game had potential but they've ruined it completely with greed.

A great party version of the base game...with some caveats for owners of the original
","

  Love this game and the party version plays like the SFW original and has some of the imploding kittens expansion cards except the Reversal card and Imploding kitten. There are enough cards to play up to 10 players as stated on the box but the deck itself is separated by a 2-3 player deck and a 4-7 player deck. The two decks combined make for 8-10 player games. The Attack and Targeted Attack cards are changed to ""double slap"" and ""triple slap"" function similarly as targeted attack but now stack if players play them in tandem, getting rid of the gray area of playing multiple attack cards in a row.As much as I didn't want to do so because the game itself deserves 5-stars, I had to ding a star for the party version. The card backs are different than the original game so RIP expanding this version with any of the current/upcoming expansions. Also, it's not plastic wrapped from the outside which didn't make much sense to me and the 2-3 and 4-7 player decks aren't separated from one another so a very tedious sorting was needed prior to use. Also, when playing with 4 players, the 4-7 player deck is very noticeably slower, so if you like faster kitten games, modify as appropriate. Played fine when playing with 6 players and the full 10 players. That being said though, the concept of the ""party"" pack begged the question to me, why don't I just get another base copy of the game to account for larger gettogethers? I ultimately shelved this copy for display (or plan to give this copy away to a friend who didn't own kittens later on) and plan to buy a other base copy to follow in the same spirit as the party pack.New players, I'd say if you want to have a game with more than 5-6 players as is in the vanilla, get two copies of the base deck and the expansion to get the full flavor of cards this game has (about the same price as the party pack when on sale). You'll also be future proofing for further expansions going forward.For die hard kitten fans, this is still a fine addition to your game collection and definitely some fan service is in the box (not going to spoil). It's also a great gift copy for occasions where >6 players are needed and most of the player-base will be new players.

Buying this awesome game for the 2nd time
","

  I bought this the first time earlier this year ahead of the camping season, something new for our group's game night. It was a huge hit, especially with the kids, because what 6-year-old doesn't love exploding kittens? (At least conceptually.) It took a little bit of explaining and coaching to get the kids up to speed but after that they ruled the table like the merciless sociopaths kids are. They will throw you into the path of an exploding kitten card without thinking twice.Seriously though, this is a great game for kids and adults, and so it's fun for family game nights. Kids can play on the same level as adults and they love that.I ended up donating my original to the games pile at an AMC hut on our last group hiking trip (shout out Lonesome Lake). Now grabbing another ahead of the holidays because there are more gatherings ahead and I hate small talk. Now, instead of listening uncomfortably to Uncle Fred's latest MAGA rant, or worse, getting drunk enough to engage him in a conversation (shudder), I can bring on the exploding kittens.

One HUGE flaw...
","

  For starters, we love the game. I have 3 girls ages 9, 7, & 3. The 9 & 7yo love the game, the quarky characters, and the simple premise. This game would be worth $20 for a deck of cards IF it were a deck of cards that could endure the treatment of children.Not only that, but even when we first got the game, I did all of the card handling. Even when I was shuffling the new deck of cards, edges of the cards started peeling back during the simple shuffling process. Just within the first few games. Which seems easily avoidable since playing cards have been around for quite some time now. It's not new technology or anything.My 7yo cheats, and peeled edges on cards can be used to cheat.Choose a new printing service, and you'll get 5 stars from me. But charging us $20 for a poor quality product that costs so little to produce just seems like garbage business ethics.

Great game, production quality could be better...
","

  I must say, this game is funny and a blast to play. I can see why it has so many positive reviews.  We love it, and would give the game five stars except for two issues.  The first is that it is simply a card game.  Paying $20 for a deck of cards seems a bit steep to me.  However, honestly, that  wouldn't bother me as much if not for the second issue.  The production quality of the cards are low.  Most of the regular decks of cards I've played lasted longer than these.  Within a few weeks, we were seeing wear on the cards that took some of the mystery out of what was in another players hands.  Now, after about 20 games, every card is marked by wear on the edges.  I would encourage the game developers to invest in a thicker card with a heavier wax like the ones many other card decks are made with.  If you purchase the game, and you have a laminator, it may be wise to laminate before gameplay so the cards last a long time.  If they do, it will be well worth having.  It's a hilarious game to play!

  My wife and I sat down to enjoy our first game of Exploding Kittens and had a ball. She didn't think she was going to enjoy this game very much, based on the name, but when I explained that half of the proceeds from sales go to cat shelters, she agreed to give it a shot. Twenty minutes later, and she was laughing her kitten-loving head off.Disclaimer:  No actual kittens were exploded during the making of this game.It was the Rainbow-Ralphing Cat card that did it to her. Ever hear of the artist called ""The Oatmeal?"" He's the artistic genius whose talent is depicted on each and every card.This is the card game that made history on Kickstarter.com by being the most backed Kickstarter ever (as of this writing). By the way, there is an expansion set in the works, called ""Imploding Kittens"" and it looks to be just as fun.

Great Game - Poor Card Quality
","

  I'm breaking this review down into two categories:  Gameplay and Quality of Product.Gameplay:  Excellent.  Really fun game that the entire family can play.  As adults, we'd rather play this than a lot of other family style/card games.  We also have a 13 year old, 6 year old and a 4 year old.  Our older boy is the one who suggested it and it was a hit.  Took about 2 open-hand games and 2 assisted games to get our 6 year old going, but after that he was good to go.  Our 4 year old can even play on her own now after a couple weeks of watching and sitting with us...she really doesn't need much help.There's definitely a strategy involved and each game is quite different.  Where it can get tough, is if an older player is very strategic and the younger players are more basic (like most games).  There's a lot more to it, than say Uno.  Overall, for gameplay, it gets 5 STARS!Quality of Product:  This where the stars drop for me.  First, for $20, I was expecting more than just a deck of cards.  I didn't know what the game was but figured there would be more than just a deck in the box when I opened.  In the end, I'm fine with the price.  It's a great game.  BUT, the quality of the cards is about as cheap as you can get.We've had the game for a few weeks and played it quite a bit, but that cards are literally falling apart already.  The corners are peeling apart a couple are ripped a little bit, just from normal shuffling.  They're so floppy now, it's difficult to even shuffle them.  Several cards are easy to pick out, based on the blemishes.  This is especially tough when it comes to the Kitten or Defuse cards, the two most important sets of cards in the game.  It changes everything if you can pick out a Kitten just by looking at the back side.It sucks, because I would seriously consider buying the expansion pack but the difference in the cards will be so noticeable, I'm not sure it would be worth it.  Pretty disappointing because, like I said, it's a great game....the quality of the cards is just so low.  They really should be more laminated, like a good set of Bicycle cards or something, especially because it's not like you can just go out and quickly (and cheaply) pick up another deck.  I'd rather have less packaging and better cards.Soooo, yes, I would definitely recommend the game, just don't expect it to last too long.

Must-have expansion if you're a fan of the original!
","

  I forgot that I pre-ordered this, so I squealed with glee when the mailwoman surprised me! My 9-year-old daughter, my boyfriend and I play Exploding Kittens way too often. It has never gotten boring on its own, but we could barely contain our excitement when opening this expansion pack. On the box, it only boasts three new actions in addition to an imploding kitten, but inside contains so much more! The new cards completely change the game, in the best way.You receive:o Alter the Future, where you can not only peek at, but switch the first three cards.o Reverse, where you reverse the order of play.o Draw from the Bottom, where you do exactly what it says. This is useful when you know someone is out to get you.o Target Attack, which is played like an attack, but you get to pick the player you wish to attack.o Feral cat, which is like a wild (haha!) card for cat cards! These definitely change the game.o Imploding kitten, which cannot be diffused! The addition of this card also allows for 6 players instead of the old maximum of 5.You also receive a human-sized Cone of Shame for the first person to forget which player's turn is next. My daughter is WAY more excited about this than I am. That's probably the point.You can choose to play with ANY OR ALL of the new expansion cards. Pick and choose your favourites! The only thing I feel must be noted is that several of the new action cards are for playing with 3 or more players. Choosing who to attack or reversing order, for example, wouldn't make a difference in a 2 player game.The artwork is hilarious, as expected from The Oatmeal. Overall, if you are a fan of Exploding Kittens, this expansion is pretty much a necessity, especially if you often play with a group.

  Great game SUPER FUN!  It's super addicting.  I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and the whole family loves it.  We have played it a hundred times in less than a month that we have had it.  We've played it every time we have friends over.So why only 3 stars?Because there is a major flaw:The cards are already falling apart.  They just don't last. The quality is equal to a cheap deck of cards, not a high quality deck. Don't be confused by the pictures, YOU ARE BUYING A DECK OF CARDS for $20... which I would have no problem with if the quality of the cards was so that it would last.  If you're going to sell me a deck of cards for $20 please improve the quality so that they will last.  It is crazy fun. Is it fun enough to pay another $20 for another deck when this one finally gives out? probably not.

Distinguishing card issue fixed
","

  When I first got this expansion and read the reviews I was seeing some people complain that the expansion cards were differently sized and colored which got me a bit worried. Luckily however it looks like the issue has been fixed. The only difference is the side of the stack looks whiter than my well loved deck which has turned a slight parchment color over time. That however isn't the company's fault. But when mixed you would't be able to tell especially when looking down as you would when playing.People were definitely right about the large amount of packaging making this expansion about the size of a tall children's book.The actual cards add a delightful degree of strategy and variety to the main game. Can't wait to play and would say this expansion was well worth it.Now if only the bonus cards you get separately in other merchandise like the keychains weren't so distinguishing that'd be great. But that's another product entirely.

  Loved, loved, loved. I didn't know what to expect with this. I never really heard about this game before, but saw it as an alternative to Cards Against Humanity for my son. I bought it for my sone who is 16 and autistic. I wanted a card game that I can play with him or others that wasn't childish or rude. This game was so much fun! It's not rude, but it is funny. There is sarcastic humor, but not the crude kind even though the name would suggest something else. We played it with my 8 year old nephew and it was easy to learn. I found that glancing at the rules and then just diving in an checking the rules as you go was the best way to learn. It was easy to learn if you didn't study the instructions like a technical manual that you were going to be tested on. The cards also have the instructions on them, so getting the basics down was the only essential and the basics was that your turn finished when you drew a card from the pile. Great game for anyone 7 and up I think.

  One might think, upon first inspection, that there is way too much packaging material for a mere 20 cards to expand one's Exploding Kittens core game. However, upon opening the box, one would discover that not only are there the expected 20 brand new cards, illustrated by the Oatmeal, but also a plastic divider and.... no drumroll, please (you'll scare the kitties)... a Human Cone of Shame! ""What in the name of the Oatmeal's Holy Name would you do with a Human Cone of Shame?"" one might ask. I'm glad one asked! One would have to wear it until the end of the game if one forgot it was their turn to play!The Imploding Kitten card is diabolical. When drawn, it must be put back in the deck, face up, and the next person to draw it is out of the game, period. No Defuse card may be played, and it cannot be noped. Suddenly, that Shuffle card you drew three rounds ago just became a lot more important, didn't it?The ability to reverse the order of play, a la Uno, also adds a new twist.As always, the cards are beautifully done.The game remains a pleasure to play, as I do often with my work friends during lunch.

Inconsistent size and color? - check if you got a fake original edition!

  After playing Exploding Kittens at a friends house I decided that I needed to have this in my game collection as well. I purchased the original Exploding Kittens game, the Streaking Kittens expansion as well as the Imploding Kittens expansion pack on Amazon a little while ago. The game itself is fabulous but I do have a huge issue with the difference in quality and size for all three items.  The original is somewhat pale red in appearance, has no texture and measures approximately 62mmx87mm per each card  The first expansion is darker in color, has a grid like texture and measures approximately 63mmx88mm per each card  The second expansion is darker shade of red in color, has a grid like texture and measures approximately 63mmx88mm per each cardThis might seem mediocre to some people but fact is that the size difference makes shuffling quite awkward. The color and texture difference further enables some really attentive players to figure out what the opponent has on hand. I have included some pictures of my cards as well. Hoping to be able to purchase another set of these cards with identical quality, size and appearance to make playing this game more fun.UPDATE: Well, it appears that some exploding kittens versions sold here are cheap knock of versions which results in inconsistent size and color issues as described by me in above. Meanwhile I have gotten The Original edition directly from the manufacturer and here are some pictures of my two versions.Original Box: is darker shade of read and reads ORIGINAL EDITION in the top right corner, has cut outs on the sides for easy opening, has holographic stick in the back next to the barcode, the card tray is flat black in color and deep enough to accommodate the entire original edition AND expansion packs and (as described in above) there is a size and texture difference between knock off and  the real deal.Fake Box: Is slightly lighter in color and does NOT have the original edition written in the top right corner, no cut outs on the sides for easy pening, no holographic sticker in the back, very shallow shiny cheap card tray that barely accommodates the original edition cards.Hoping this info helps others! If you too received a knock off at your first try I suggest you DEMAND a refund!

We didn‚Äôt have internet connection to watch the online instructions so we just had the paper instructions which should have been enough, but they weren‚Äôt very clear.It also was confusing when my grandmother was out of cards but hadn‚Äôt gotten an exploding cat yet (had used her diffuse card as her last card to diffuse the cat) and my grandfather still had cards so he went and got an exploding cat. So does that mean my grandma who didn‚Äôt even have cards was the winner?Overall we had a laugh, but there‚Äôs was a bit too much left to the imagination for a true card player.

Great expansion, different color cards.

  Great expansion, but the backs of the cards didn't match the backs of the original game.  I contacted their customer support, who was awesome and sent me another deck of Imploding Kittens.  The backs were closer in color, but were unfortunately still noticeably different (smooth vs. textured cards).I ended up sleeving the cards, and by taking out the insert, the sleeved core deck and expansion still fight in the original box.The expansion itself is great, and I highly recommend getting it if you're a fan of the base game.  It adds some really fun cards.

Fun gameplay, but overpriced and not durable
","

  There have already been enough reviews about the gameplay itself, so I'll keep it brief - it's super fun (and quick!) and my 10 and 11 year old step-kids love it (as do the adults). Knocking my review down to 3 stars because:1. The game consists of nothing more than a deck of cards. $20 is *way* overpriced.2. After playing maybe 20 games, some of the cards are already starting to 'peel' at the corners - including one of our exploding kitten cards (knowing that a card is an exploding kitten more or less ruins the game).

Adds a Lot More to the Game!
","

  As a person that has purchased the core game and first expansion, I was excited to see that a second expansion was available. Even more so that it was on pre-sale for $5. My friends and I love playing the game, so more variation is better, right?After receiving the expansion, my first impressions was, that there are quite a few new options available for actions. The cards are of equal quality to the original cards. In general, I am looking forward to trying this expansion out. I will update this review once I do.Now, why isn't this a 5 star review? Simply put, they seemed to cheap out on some of the action cards. Several are duplicates, instead of having a new, and interesting image for each card. Mixing the lack of play, and this cop-out, I would put this at 4 stars. removing the lack of play, I would call this expansion a 4.5 star expansion. It is a relatively minor gripe.Please keep in mind, that this is a first impression. I still think the expansion is worth while to buy. Particularly if you love the core game, and previous expansion. It adds quite a bit to the game. I kinda wish it had come with 1-2 more defuse cards too, but that is more of a wish than need.

  Pros: Easy to learn basic game play even for smaller kids; the cards are unique and funny; it is different in that you don't necessarily have to wait your turn to play (nope cards are fun!)Cons: You absolutely need to buy the 10 player party pack. I don't know why they even make the basic pack because it is not enough cards for even 4 players.Not sure which column this goes in:  for the more competitive game player, the game does offer a good deal of strategy on how and when you play your cards. If you like hearts or spades this would fall in that category.

Expansion Pack Different Color Than Game Cards - Ruins Game.
","

  Our family enjoyed the Exploding Kittens game, it's fun to play, but limited to 2-5 players. We bought the expansion kit to allow more players. Unfortunately, the expansion kit cards are a darker red than the exploding kitten cards (see photograph). This ruins the game because you can tell which cards to draw and which cards to avoid without seeing them. Thinking this was a fluke, we ordered a second card game and expansion pack, but the result was the same (see photo). The manufacturing quality assurance process is not good, hopefully the company will fix this problem. shortly. [ASIN:B01HSIIFQ2 Imploding Kittens: This is the First Expansion of Exploding Kittens]

  I got this for my teenage daughter, and it was both well-received and well-played! This is a quirky, funny and flexible game that beats the hell out of any electronic caca you might be considering as a gift. This little card game provides actual interaction in a light and funny way, plus allows - indeed encourages- a high amount of silly randomness in the way its played. Very fun, and fine for two to four people. If you want a version for a bigger group, then I'd recommend getting the Imploding Kittens (as well? I don't know if it's a stand-alone version, but I think it might be).Don't worry: no actual kittens were harmed in the making of this game. Several did barf rainbows, however.

Super Fun and adds strategy
","

  If you are like me and love the normal pack of exploding kittens and imploding kittens(the first expansion) you are going to love this game.  You can play without the Imploding kittens pack but you do need the original or the party pack in order to play.  This game adds a ton of strategy but is still based on luck as well.  Here is a summary of what each of the cards do.The streaking kitten allows you to hold one exploding kitten in your hand without dying.  However, it can be taken from you and get you killed.The catamic bomb card brings all the exploding kittens to the top of the pile.  Does not include the imploding kitten.The swap top and bottom card is where you switch the top and bottom cards.The Mark card is where you can pick a card from someone else's hand to be public until it is played or stolen.There is one see the future of the first five cards and one alter the future of the first five cards.

Great addition, added sorely needed game mechanics
","

  Great addition to exploding kittens. The original game was unique and my wife and I loved showing it off to unsuspecting friends and relatives, but the mechanics of the cards made the game feel more one dimensional than it could have otherwise been. The most fun card to use, the NOPE card, isn't plentiful enough, the defuse cards are far too powerful and encourage hoarding and waiting for the game to end, and some cards felt incomplete, like see the future and shuffle behaved as two halves of one whole.Imploding kittens corrected for practically all of these little gripes that I had with the original game. The defuse cards are noticably less powerful thanks to the imploding kitten, there are other very fun cards to play besides the NOPE card (like the targeted attack), and the see the future and the shuffle cards have been given new life with the mechanics of the imploding kitten. The original game is great, but this expansion completes it.

It was really cold, none of our family could come over due to flus & other sicknesses, so they were bored enough to sit and try this out.Holy macaroni, was it easy to learn and did we ever laugh? The answers are Yes and Yes! We enjoyed it so much, we played again. Then opened the expansion pack and played a third time.

Idiot-proof instructions and review
","

  This game is FUN. If you are a fan of the artist's blog, you'll enjoy it that much more, but knowing previous work is unnecessary. The game is fun, and at first reading sounds very complicated, but it is in fact simple and quick. And a lot of laughs. Don't be afraid of the cards or illustrations... They are quirky and strange (like the blog :-) but not offensive. Okay, the TEENSIEST bit rude, yes. But funny. Wildly creative.This game allows 2-5 people to play. If you may have a larger group, do buy a second set of cards. It is money well invested.The game is like russian roulette. Each person draws a card. At any time you may draw an exploding kitten, and if you do, you die for the remainder of the hand. But, of course, there is more involved than that!!For the first round, keep the directions handy. You'll need them. For subsequent rounds you will probably not need them much at all.To begin play, everyone is dealt a hand of four cards (look at them but show no one) and one defuse card. The defuse card is your lifeline. Hide it within your hand. (Once you draw an exploding kitten card, you are dead for the hand. UNLESS you can play a defuse card.) You can play any card you have available... Some cards allow you to draw a card from another player's hand, some allow you to peek at what's coming in the draw pile, or to skip your turn, or make the next player draw twice... You CAN play anything, but don't NEED to play anything. Once you are finished playing, or if you've decided not to play anything, draw a card (and hope it isn't an exploding kitten. If it is, play your defuse)If you run out of cards, that's okay. Draw when it's your turn. If you accumulate so many cards they are difficult to hold, that's okay, too. (And better for saving your life!) Keep drawing at your turn. You are not penalized for cards you hold or play. The only goal is to survive drawing the exploding kittens within the deck, or to cause others to draw them. (there is an exploding kitten card in the deck for all but one player. One player survives the hand)Making any sense?? Order the cards, play a hand... It will all be made clear. It is a fast and silly game, very fun. Particularly with people who will enjoy the strange quirky weirdness of the illustrations. Choose your friends well.If you are still on the fence, just do it! What are a few exploded kittens between friends?

Rules were poorly thought out, so you NEED the ""first expansion pack""
","

  Game play with the default deck is REALLY boring -- you make pairs with cat cards but all that pairing does it let you steal a card (unseen and therefore random) from another player. There is no reversing the direction of play. There is a card to _see_ the future cards in the pickup deck, but no card to _arrange_ in the pickup deck. You will need to make some serious home rules, like a pair of taco cats lets you steal a card from another player OR, for example, reverse direction of play OR peek at another player's hand or part of their hand, etc. To a large degree, the ""first expansion pack"" solves many of these issues.

Some clever additions, but not as useful if there are only two players.

  This spring, I spent week after week playing Exploding Kittens with a 6th grader I was tutoring in math. This was the ""reward"" for the mathematical hard work. We got to know the game very well but after a couple of months I learned about this expansion pack and bought it. It comes with the following cards:Targeted Attack (3)Reverse (4)Feral Cat (4)Alter the Future (4)Imploding Kitten (1)Draw From the Bottom (4)I like the idea of the Imploding Kitten (the first time you draw it, nothing happens, you return it to the draw pile face up and the next time it's drawn, there's no way to avoid implodence) and the Alter the Future (you don't just see the next three cards, you can change the order) and Draw From the Bottom, but Feral Cat adds nothing, while Reverse doesn't help unless you have three or more players. In summary, there are a few clever cards here but I'm not sure it's worth it if you, like me, typically play with only one opponent.

So Much Wrong...

  I can't, for the life of me, figure out why this game is so popular on Amazon. High ratings and at the time of this review, 25k+ reviews! I seriously thought this was an obvious slam dunk.The amount of cards that come with this game is insanely scarce, especially for $20. The deck is just so extremely small. The quality of the actual cards and box it comes in is nice.The artwork on the cards is.... honestly, it's just terrible. If you've played Unstable Unicorns, you know that this sort of ""weird"" artwork can actually be nice (sorry, I don't know what the official genre of art is). But the art on Exploding Kittens was borderline repulsive lol Just not appealing at all. Grossed me out more than once, and not in a funny type of way.Neither my husband or I really understood the ""point"" of the game. I wouldn't say this a good two player game, and maybe that's my hangup. There just isn't enough going on.Unstable Unicorns is another card game that is similarly priced with the same amount and level of reviews, but that game beats this one 100% hands down. If you're poking around for a new game and don't have either of these, I'd try Unstable first. It's got some strategy, way more cards and is infinitely more fun.

Simple, Fun, Quick, Variety, Luck plays a role, Not Mindless and plays in under an hour!
","

  Simple to learn, Fun to play, Play is Quick, Lots of Variety (if you need it), a bit of Luck is involved yet it is Not Mindless! And it lasts less than an hour! Awesome!Many games which are simple, fun, have a good deal of luck involved and are quick to play are good, but many leave me feeling empty. I like to feel I have some control over my game, and am fine with a luck element as long as it is mitigated. If this describes your gaming style, you will love Quacks of Quedlinburg. I have played the games several times with different people and all have said they really liked the game.It won strategic game of the year but could have easily fit into the family game category instead (as intended by the company North Star Games). Kids around 10 could play and have fun, but a little more understanding of probability and they will probably do better. Either way they will enjoy the push your luck element and getting stuff.Quacks is a deckbuilding, push-your-luck game, where you draw tiles out of your bag each round, get surprise bonuses, and have ways to buy more tiles so you can do better the next round.Each player's starting space or ""drop"" begins the game at space zero. This starting space can permanently move forward later in the game with certain events. Having you starting space further along the track will allow you to get further and acquire more stuff, so it is kind of important.Each round begins with one player (starting player for that round) turning over the top card of the ""fortune teller"" deck which adds some simple change to the game this round.Starting in the second round, players that are behind the leader(s) may be given a temporary ‚Äúboost‚Äù to help them catch up based on the number of rat tails between their scoring token and the leader(s). This ‚Äúboost‚Äù moves up their starting position and acts as a catchup mechanism (if you were unlucky previously). It resets each round so you may have it one round, not the next and maybe even get a bigger boost later ‚Äì it just depends on the game situation each round. Then the core of the game starts.Players draw tiles simultaneously out of their own bags and try and advance their tokens the furthest along the track. The number on each tile indicates how many spaces ahead of your previously placed tile you place it on the track. Then another tile is drawn and placed that many spaces in front of the last. Tiles are of different colors (red, orange, green, blue, black, purple, yellow and white) and each may have an effect on the game depending on the chosen books being played that game. If the total on your drawn and played white tiles ever exceeds 7, you blow up your potion, but you still get to place the tile that blew you up. No other tiles count toward this total. The person(s) who advance furthest each round, without blowing up, get to roll a bonus die which gives a simple advantage.Next., players are rewarded for playing certain tiles on the board (black, green and purple). Following this, players who have advanced to a space rewarding a ruby are given that reward.Now the important stage - victory point advancement and purchasing. If your potion didn't blow up, you will get the victory points (object of the game is to have the most) AND ability to spend money on more tokens (which help you get more money and victory points) as indicated on your stopping space (technically it is the one in front of you). IF YOU BLEW UP, you only get to choose one: victory points OR spending money.After this has been done, players may spend rubies to reset their flask (explain below) or advance their starting space permanently by 1 for every 2 rubies spent. Then a new round begins (there are nine in a game).Extra notes: Each player has a flask which can be used to erase the last white tile drawn, as long as it didn‚Äôt cause you to blow up. Players turn over flask to show it was used, return the tile to the bag, and draw again. Once used, the flask must be refilled in the future during the end of the round.In some rounds, different colored tiles are added to the game for purchase, and in a later round each player adds an extra white tile to their bag. There is a different side to each board (which I haven‚Äôt played with yet) that gives players different options to get stuff rather than advance their tokens, and there are 4 different sets of rules (books) so each game can be fresh. Plus, the fortune teller deck is shuffled each game, so it leaves a little bit of unpredictability. Why do I mention this? Because this allows the game to be different each time, while keeping the mechanics the same (so you don‚Äôt need to learn anything new). That really helps with replayability.I know this game will get a lot of playing time for me and I hope it does for you. Each game lasts about 45-50 minutes, so it is a perfect length for a game (in my opinion).

Kind of torn about this. It's not really exciting.

  I watched a lot of reviews about this. I like the presentation. Besides the nit-pick about using cardboard ingredient pieces that will wear, it seems like a good game and that I'd love it.But I don't.The items you pick up CAN synergize, but are VERY random. Which leads to a lot of disappointment and you can get some bad rounds that are hard to catch up from. Unlike a deckbuilder, you don't go through the whole deck/bag. And you can't increase your draw to mitigate some of the randomness.In the end, it's so random that it fell a bit flat for us. We like to think and strategize a bit more.On the other hand, I think it would be a fun social game and fun in crowds.For us, this will go out in trade.

Fun theme, good replay value
","

  Easy to learn, fun to play. A sort of chip drafting game where you press your luck to try and get more points and money with a fun theme. There's a rat tail mechanic for the players that are behind in scoring, where they can start their next potion with a handicap to prevent one person from running away with the game, this is also helpful when teaching as it lets new players get a feel for the game without falling too far behind.The player boards are double sided with different options of play, while the ingredient books are double sided with sets of two that score or interact differently, and the fortune teller deck changes the rules of each round or gives a bonus to players. This gives a good variation of play and replay value.There is a fair amount of luck involved, but the ingredients you buy can help offset this. It's definitely on the light side, but it's very enjoyable. Everyone I've played with really liked it from more casual gamers to people that enjoy more heavy weight strategy oriented games.

  Received this one on my birthday, so that was a cool bonus.  Really wasn't expecting it for another 10 days or so.It has been quite a long time since I bought a new board game, so bought this along with some others like those Tiny Epic games for me and my family to enjoy.To say the least everyone loves this game.  Myself, my wife and my 9 year old daughter.  At first it seemed a bit complicated but as the turns go along you get used to the flow of how everything works.  So it didn't take long, maybe 3 turns before everyone knew what was going on.The best part about the game is of course the potion making.  At first it is annoying as you have so many cherry bomb ingredients vs. other ingredients so you sometimes didn't do much of anything but as you go along in the victory points and buy new ingredients to use, you begin to be able to place many ingredients each round.So far we are only using Set 1 but it is pretty awesome and clever to have 4 different sets for most of the ingredients, changing the dynamics and strategy you can use for each placed ingredient or what ingredients to purchase.One thing I would love to see added is actual unique recipes.  Say for example you stop your pot with 3 whites, 2 oranges, 2 blues.  You can look up a unique potion and that finished potion has some sort of unique end of round effect like getting 4 rubies or allowing your next potion to keep the same ingredients out or you know, anything really.  Would be a cool thing.Anyway.  The game is fast paced and very fun.  Yelling and hollering ensues as your luck is bad one round while the next you get the furthest you've ever been this able to afford more ingredients for the next potion.Very fun.  Definitely buying the expansion and hopefully new expansions come out at some point.

  This is a great game and I highly recommend it to both light and serious gamers. Some of its pros- Everyone takes their turns at the same time which vastly speeds up the game, however the there is still plenty of interaction in other parts of the game.- There are 5 different variants of the game in one box, allowing for a lot of replayability.- This game could easily be 5 players without changing any of the mechanics, you would just need more pieces. I believe there is an expansion to the game allowing for 5 players, so you have to buy more stuff, but it is really hard to find good games for 5 players.

  Don't be fooled by Quacks colorful and kid-friendly exterior. This is a very deep and tactical potion making game with lots of variables, multiple paths to victory and a healthy dose of probability and a splash of luck.

The game has high replay value thanks to the myriad of ways you can play the game, alongside two expansions. I don't feel the expansions are necessary to play, but if you love the game you can't go wrong with more.I played with my brother, niece, and nephew. We all had great fun!

Easy to pick up and play!
","

  I love this game already! I saw it at PAX unplugged a couple years ago and have been interested in it ever since, but I only just finally bought it. The game play is laid out for easy comprehension and shouldn't take TOO long to play - there are only 9 rounds.  It's a bit balanced in luck and strategy if you build up your ingredients well at the beginning. We played the base game once and the alternate board once and both sides were fun (the alternate uses a second droplet that you can move up to test tubes of beneficial rewards - adding just a slight variation to the base).  I highly recommend this game and am very glad I got it!

Missing pieces
","

  Game was missing 17 pieces.  Apparently, the game we received was published by Schmidt Spiele (not North Star) as the listing stated - so all North Star could do was refer me to the German publisher's British website where we could send a LETTER detailing our problem.  Contacted seller and they just told us to return it.  Couldn't to an ""exchange"" for some reason - so now we have to return the game and buy another (at a higher price).That said, it is a FUN GAME (if you have all of the pieces).

  What a fun game. My 8 year old granddaughter loves playing it with us. The mechanic of putting your hand in a bag and pulling out piece after piece is oddly satisfying and climactic at the same time. Will I get the extra token I need or will I blow up?

Occupational therapist review - 5 top skills for kids
","

  Hi.  I am an occupational therapist and I love games.  Here is my review of the top 5 developmental skills that Quacks of Quinlinberg could work on and how to help children who are challenged by them.  Have fun playing!Decision making-  Quacks has lots of choices to make throughout the game-- when to take a risk, when to hold, what tokens to choose and what to give up if your pot explodes. If your child has trouble with making choices, this is a great opportunity to practice.  How to help: You might even want to help them by determining a strategy that will be used for each round--ie first 3 rounds, I will take risks, rounds 4-6 focus on purchases, rounds 7-9 focus on gaining victory points.  Having an explicit strategy (perhaps even written on a card) helps children focus on implementing a plan and builds confidence.Risk taking- This game is heavy on  risk and luck.  It is basically a game of press your luck with some strategy built in.  The good news is there are lots of built in elements that when things go wrong, llike your pot exploding, you still continue playing and there are ways to catch up so that no one lands too far behind. How to help: Talk about how taking a risk can help even when you lose.  In this game, letting your pot explode early on can help you get more purchase power and better tokens. Players who fall behind in victory points get more rat tails.  The game is well balanced.Social skills- One benefit of Quacks is that everyone plays at the same time, so there is minimal wait time (there can be some if players play faster or slower than others).  How to help: If the child needs to wait on a slower member, help them use that time to make upcoming decisions.  If a child is the slower member, let them work at their own pace or follow the risk taking suggestions above.Fine Motor skills- The game is played by pulling small tokens out of a bag which requires in hand manipulation and bilateral coordination due to the need to hold the bag with your alternate hand. These skills are great for improving handwriting skills.  How to help:  encourage children to hold their own bag and pull items out one at a time (this is the way the game is played).  If they have difficulty, you could insert a plastic cup in the bag to maintain the space.Math skills- Each person draws tokens and places them trying to stay at or below a total value of 7 which requires adding up what you have and deducting what tokens are left.  More tokens are purchased each round according to different prices and rules that require addition.  Older kids can learn to calculate odds by counting the pieces they have left and processing how many white tokens of specific value are left that might explode the pot. How to help: Younger kids could easily team up with someone who can help them do the more difficult math.  This is a great game to have partners.One final tip-  Quacks has tons of little pieces so we organize them in pill boxes.  They fit perfectly and can be color-coded.  It makes set up and clean up so much easier and also ads the skill of organization to the game.

Lively, Beautiful Deck-Builder with Strong Replay Variety
","

  Huge fun.  Great gambling mechanic that livens things up and reaches a less board-game-y audience.  Not for people who are easily bummed out by bad luck, as it comes from time-to-time, and does affect gameplay.  But the simple mechanics, variety of ways to advance and vary mechanics, balance of solo deck-building (bag-building?) and interplay between players, and fast play appeal to everyone I've played with.  This is the first game in a while that I just can't wait to play again.  And I already love the expansion‚Äîmore, more!

The rulebook isn‚Äôt consistent with names of things (‚Äúcherry bombs‚Äù = ‚Äúwhite tokens‚Äù?). Maybe it was translated poorly into English.

  The base game of Quacks has been, to date, one of our best board game investments, and remains a favourite among our growing collection. We have been anxiously awaiting this expansion since we knew of its existence!We were NOT disappointed.The function of the witches, and the new 'pages' in the book that add additional options for existing ingredients, really opens up the game. We love some of the new interactions between ingredients, that allow you to accelerate your progress, both around the VP track, and within your pot on each turn!Being able to buy chips to put in OTHER players' pots, that benefit YOU when they draw them, was a fun twist as well.The Witches have proven to be a game changer at opportune moments, especially when you forget they're there and then all of a sudden - BAM - they completely change the outcome of your turn!We will forever be indebted to Shut Up & Sit Down for turning us on to this (and MANY other) game(s).Happy stirring!

  I generally loathe board games, and when one of my in-laws drags them out I try to slip away or find an excuse not to play. But I watched a round of this, and jumped in and wanted to play! With a group of a dozen people aged 9-81 (those who didn't have headbands had to put their card face down and hold it up during their turn), we had a fantastic time playing this crazy game.So I ordered my own set to play with the 3 children I nanny for, and while they are a little young, and only one can read, I pre-selected easily recognizable cards and they caught on very quickly! I didn't use the timer for the little ones, because everyone gets to participate in everyone else's turn, so they don't get impatient. My only complain is that the newer cards, in the edition I purchased, have much more ""stylized"" illustrations on them, so there were some simple words that I had to pull from the deck, because the kids weren't likely to guess the right word.

Great game for children albeit with limited replay value
","

  Purchased this game as a Christmas present for my nephew. Finally had a chance to play it for the first time a few weeks ago. I was thinking it would be pretty easy for us adults playing a kids game, I was wrong. We played with 3 adults, a teenager, and a 6 year old. The 6 year old was able to do better than half the people! I think this speaks volumes to how good of a kids game this actually is. It can be equally challenging for everyone.The game play itself is a self guided question game. Everyone has a ""hedbanz"", which is just what they call their plastic headbands that are included with the game. Each player places a card on their respective hedbanz. Everyone can see your card, except you. Your card has an illustration in addition to the description of what it is. The game includes a card with sample questions, but my group of players found that most of those questions were useless on most of the cards. You begin the game with three playing chips in front of you and a timer. When the timer begins you ask yes or no questions about your card. If you guess your card correctly before the timer runs out you get to give up a playing chip and continue with a new card until the timer runs out. After that point play passes to the next player, while you keep the card that stumped you. You continue with this card until you guess it correctly. The first player to get rid of all three chips wins the game!The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the replay value. It seems there are about 50 cards that come with the came. If you play a round with 5 people those 50 cards do not go very far at all. With my group of 5 we went through approximately 10 cards during a session of this game. That means that after approximately 5 times playing this game you will begin to repeat cards. This will obviously hurt the replay value. Perhaps this is something that can be solved with an expansion at some point.

  How does it work?A headband on your head, holding a card with a picture that only the others can see.The person with the headband is to guess what's on the card.Why get it?Kids love it. This game is one of the first things my 8-year-old's friends pull out (and we have at least 40 board games) and want to play, every time they come over.Replay value?As other reviewers have pointed out, the replay value is limited due to a limited number of cards. That is if you play by the rules. There are so many ways to improvise with this game, and that includes adding different cards, making your own, attaching post-it notes to the cards.So if that's the case, why get it all?Because it makes you PLAY. We all have ideas about doing charades and 20-questions (Alexa makes us do that more often) but the beauty of this games is ITS SIMPLICITY. You pull it out. You get started in 2 minutes.It reminds you to PLAY.Anyone can play, and you can adjust for everyone's level. Great for learning how to think about sorting big amounts of data. Great for learning how to phrase questions. Great communication activity. Lots of laughters and fun.

  We actually purchased this game at the recommendation of my daughter's speech therapist - she was doing great in the speech therapy office and said all of her sounds perfectly, because she was focused on it.  Her problem was when she was excited about something and talking too fast; all her sounds got jumbled and she was difficult to understand.  Playing this game helped her spontaneously use the proper sounds for each letter, because she was invested in playing and wanted to win AND be understood when giving clues.  Worked like a charm.  On top of it all, the whole family had fun playing this together.

  I ordered the HedBanz adult edition and then went through the cards and eliminated certain cards so I could use them with my teenage youth group. The words weren't bad (one was ""bra.) but I wanted to avoid silly teenage giggles as much as possible.It is one of the most fun games the kids play. There are headbands for six, but you can use a regular head band across the forehead to hold a card and more kids can play. One boy put his cap on backwards and used the strap in the back to hold his card.We have played this with adults too and we end up laughing until we cry.Great game. Easy to play. Lots of fun.

By the time I opened the box to play the game, 30 days had passed since I purchased it and I could not return it. I attempted to contact the maker of the game, just to request the cards in English.

Banz!

  My mother's last name is Banz, because when her husband's family entered the USA at Ellis Island from Germany back in the early 1900's, he spelled it to the people there, and Benz became Banz for that line in America, lol. So....when I saw a game (she loves games) that looked easy to play, and had her name on it, I had to buy it. She LOVED it. Now we have to play it all the time, and she always points out the ""Banz"" part, but she's in her 80's now, so whatever she enjoys, we enjoy. I'll have to post a photo of her. She looks great for her age. Plus she can outlast nearly any of us! Our grandmother lived to be nearly 102, and I expect my mom to be 120, at least. She's active, happy, still works every day, and loves life.

HedBanz Game - The Kids Like It (AMAZON IS THE BEST!)

  I purchased the 'HedBanz Game' as a Christmas gift for kids in the family. The product was packaged well and it was delivered on time.I was not around when the game was played, but from what I have heard from other family members the kids like it a lot! They find it fun and engaging. The parents like the game, because it is an 'old school' group style of game, and not a solo video game. HedBanz is one of those games that promotes social interaction between kids and adults as well.I am looking forward to playing it!AMAZON IS THE BEST!When I originally purchased this Christmas gift on December 17th (along with another gift), they were delivered on time - but were stolen! I reported the robbery to the police, because that is what you are supposed to do. I, myself, put this matter at the bottom of the polices priorities.Then, I called AMAZON and explained the situation. AMAZON was very understanding and replaced this gift and the other, at no additional cost to me! They were both delivered in time for the holiday! I, of course, give AMAZON a huge THANK YOU for the amazing customer service I received!

Fun game to play with kids
","

  This game gave us lots and lots of laughs. Fantastic for families with kids since the things to guess were easy and age appropriate. The headbands could be better: too tight for some of the adults and too small for the smallest children but the game was so fun, we didn't care. the cards are nice and sturdy and the concept of the game is great, it really gets kids thinking and is fantastic for kids to practice categories like fruits, vegetables, etc.

I often bring this to parties and everyone quickly becomes friends. :D This is cheaper on amazon than at Walmart or Target. Don‚Äôt hesitate.

Cute, Fun, but PRICEY
","

  When I initially saw this game I thought of the Ellen show when she wears that ridiculous headband and her guests guess what the words are. I thought this would be a fun game for my girls and their friends to play-especially on those sleepover nights. The thing that many didn't like about this game that I actually was okay with was the fact that there are not a ton of cards and that the sand timer runs out quickly. I don't know about anyone else, but my children rarely play any of these games exactly as the directions recommend. I also teach and my students do the same thing with games in the classroom. They modify the games to suit the needs of the group. So when my children play this game, they extend the time. Actually they stopped using that timer and use a different timer we have in the house. They have also taken to using the headbands and making up their own cards to go on them to supplement the cards that come in the game. What I like about this game is the premise is simple enough that everyone gets the gist of the game quickly but the players are not bogged down in rules. The game can be modified without losing the point of the game. The thing I do take a bit of an issue with is the game's price point. I actually purchased this game prior to being offered it with Amazon Vine. I thought the premise of the game was different than the typical games and was looking for something fun to do for a girl's sleepover. However, at $20+ this is an expensive game! In this price point there should be more cards and the game should come with some sort of better timer device. Other than that, I do think this is a fun game and my children both at home and in school seem to really enjoy playing this.

  This game is hilarious. My 4 yr old isn't old enough to guess/identify his own card, but he LOVES when adults ask him questions about their cards. This is one of the few games I like playing.

  I really like the simplicity of this game. My 8 year old tends to be impatient and usually gives up on games before we get to finish. So this game is a good family compromise, if someone gets tired and wants to quit it's easy for the rest of us to either finish playing without them or all quit together. It is easy, fun, and gives you a good easy family game night with little stress unlike complicated games like monopoly.

  I ordered the Hedbanz for my daughter who is currently 40 months old. Importantly, English is not her first language.I hoped that playing the Hedbanz would be a fun way to teach my daughter new words and improve her ability to explain words if not thoughts. Although she is much younger than the suggested age, which is 7 years or older, my daughter still likes playing it. It is not easy for her to play it like adults, but she tries to follow its rules and to describe the cards she sees to me and my wife.I might be pushing her too much, but playing it for about 5-10 mins a day seems to help her new words.I personally think that this game could be helpful for ESL learners and kids younger than 7 years old in learning new words, while having fun.

  First of all it was an easy game to play. Just a guessing game with questions. Then you have the number of players. You have six headbands.  What's also good is that they chose the best number for the chips that you try to get into the bank. 24. That means if you have five people. You have to give least good at guessing a little advantage. the hard part is actually guessing. Though it sounds easy it is hard to get it right. you can spend 30 minutes on ONE card. Well  I guess that's it. Bye

I haven't played the adults version, but this is certainly not too easy for adults.

The game comes with 5 headbands so it's fun for everyone! The first time I played this game was with my entire family and I just have to say that it was tons of fun and really enjoyable. My family doesn't spend much time together so I really liked that in it's own way, this game brought us together. There was so much giggling and chuckling throughout the game while everyone tried their best to guess what they were. I recommend this game to anyone who just wants to spend some quality time with their family because I promise you that this game will be fun for everyone.

I'm really glad I bought this game. It's definitely a favorite in our house. Only downside is when you've done all of the cards, your kids tend to remember the items from before so they're able to guess the items quicker. I wish they made a refill deck of cards with new items. Maybe they'll come out with that in the future.

Cute game for young children
","

  This is a cute game for younger children.  You place a headband around each player (which looks silly enough) and then place a card in the holder on the front. Everyone else can see your card, but you cannot. Then you ask questions about what is on your card (i.e. like ""20 Questions"" game). There is a timer for each turn.  I played this with my 5 year old and we had fun first laughing about the headbands and then having fun asking questions.  I think it is a good exercise for your child to learn how to form questions and put information together to solve the puzzle.I knocked off a star because the plastic headbands, although adjustable, do not flex enough to stay on bigger heads with thick hair. I think elasticized ones would have been much better.

  Yahtzee is a classic game - fun family time is certain.However, this item is repeatedly sold without matching the description. The photo shows a red drawer and black/red dice.

I don't really care about the dice, but the shaker case is what grabbed my attention and led me to the purchase.At the price point, it's not a big deal -- just know what you're likely to receive.

  The game is fine; the box, dice and scorepads are fine.  The dice cup, however, is stupid.  I get that they made it oblong instead of round so it would fit inside the box, but how hard would it have been to square off the bottom so it would STAND UP????  Tsk.

Same great game, cheaper plastic pieces
","

  We've loved the classic Othello game for decades, and wanted to get this newer version with the raised (indented) square spaces to keep the pieces in place more easily. That part is an improvement, but the playing pieces themselves are thinner, lighter-weight plastic and much cheaper feeling. Because the pieces are so light weight, they still shift around and fall out of place easily. Also, the well where the pieces fit is an open well without any kind of lid to keep the pieces in place when the game is not being played or stored upright. The well is also longer than necessary.  Meaning, even if you put all the pieces into it, there's a wide gap at the end that allows the pieces to fall over and get disorganized. None of this changes how much fun the game is to play. I just wish the updated version was actually improved in design.  We toss the plastic pieces into a zip lock baggie so we can store our game upright, like books on a bookshelf.

Even with 5 year old kid I give him handicap by giving him all corners at start we have so much fun. I will recommend this to any age or gender. As you know strategy it ges more fun.The reason for 4 star. My grandpa's othello board had covers over coin holder to keep all coins safe and organized but this doesn't. So every single time we put away coins, all of them scatter in the box.. Also one of coins was missing black surface. It seems to be spare piece becase without it we still have 64pieaces.

The rest of the product was just fine.The green part of the board is felt-like.  There are rubber feet that come with the board.  I grew up playing an older version of Othello that I seem to remember having a clear cover for the pieces.  This version is just open air.

  OK, that sounded so wrong...but it's so true! A few years ago I met my now-wife and taught her how to play Chess. She was 20 years old. Ever since, we've been playing against each other over the last 5 years and really enjoy the quality time together. We also enjoy card games, etc. but when it's just the two of us...this is what we do now and it's great.Reason I mention is I had played Othello when I was young kid, but never owned a board, etc. So, I ordered one for my wife and I as just with Chess, Othello is an ""abstract"" two-player game. Apparently, Othello is a pretty big deal, too!At first she was hesitant, but after a couple videos and keeping instructions close, she picked it up quickly and now she's kicking my arse half the time! OK, maybe 2/3 the time, gimme a break!As for the game, ofc it's fun, but it's also presented nicely in your standard, nice little board game box. The pieces are all included individually, not cut-out until you pass-out. The board is felt and has a slot on either side for all the game pieces. It came with one extra piece, too.To make it faster for us when playing, I placed 32 pieces in each slot on the sides, pushed them forward, and marked a line w/ a pencil (removable). Then pulled them forward to mark the other end. As long as your pieces fill up the slot to that point, you've got 32 pieces on that side. EZ, PZ.

  Great game even for my 7 year old son.  Great strategy game that does not have a lot of confusing moving pieces like chess.  Just wish that it had a better way to store the pieces.

Great except for the game pieces
","

  The Good: It's Chutes and Ladders, and it has Spider-Man!  Awesome!  My only complaint- why are the game pieces so cheap???  You don't get a 3D game piece that looks like a little toy, what you get are some pieces of boxboard with the characters printed on them, and then you can insert them into these little clear plastic holders.  But get this- you have 8 different characters you can choose from- but only 4 holders???  The box says that you can ""switch them out"" if you want to play different characters, but who is going to do that?  I highly doubt the target audience of this game has the fine motor skills to do so themselves.  And any time you create a toy that the target age group cannot successfully play with by themselves, that is a design fail, my friends.  I mean, they've already given us the cheapest, lamest game pieces imaginable, but for them not to even spring for 4 extra pieces of plastic so we can even use all 8 of them?  That is just a whole new level of cheap, enough that I am knocking 2 entire stars off my rating.  I mean, come on, man!

Flimsy and confusing
","

  I was very disappointed in this game. As other reviews have mentioned, the game pieces are cheap, and there are 8 flimsy cardstock characters with only 4 tiny plastic stands. Ostensibly, this is so you can mix and match the characters you want to play- but what 3 year old is going to do that?The board itself is drawn confusingly. I played it with two different 3 year olds and a 5 year old, and none of them could figure out how to move around the board.I got this on sale, but even that seems like too much now that I know how flimsy the game is. Definitely don't recommend this.

Visually a better version
","

  So for whatever reason that we still can't figure out, this is the only game our 5 year old has a harder time playing. We have come to the conclusion that the regular version uses colors on the board that are way to close in shade which makes it hard to distinguish each separate space. Look it up! Regular version uses shades of slightly dark green and more slightly dark green to separate each space. But this one, this uses shades that are easier to distinguish. Plus spiderman is an added bonus.

  My grandson loves this game. I bought it to give him for Christmas then decided to wait until his birthday this week. I didn't notice tho box wasn't covered in plastic. When we opened it today, the directions & some of the pieces are missing. Since he's only 4, he didn't know the difference so he had a great time.

  disappointing! Got it for my 5 year old sons birthday - my 7 year old daughter played too. Very difficult to distinguish the 100 small board spaces and heavy characters kept falling over. Even my 7 year old had difficulty manipulating the board. We all started to be anxious for it to end after 15 minutes of play. After being intrigued by super heroes drawn on board my son lost interest fast - not planning on playing anytime again soon. I would not recommend to others.

  Its Spider-Man and it is Chutes & Ladders. Is it the greatest game ever? No. But my Spider-Man obsessed four year old loves it and my two year old loves to spin the spinner and move the Spider-Man characters around and go down slides.

If the box is listed as 10""x10"", a 13""x13"" game board does not lie within!As other reviewers have noted, this is an excellent game.  It was new to me and my 6-yr-old and we both learned it quickly. There are layers and layers of strategy, and it teaches so many skills related to visual/spatial acuity, math, and strategy, all within a really enjoyable game. I definitely recommend it.

Fun game but warped game tile
","

  Bought this as a gift for my neighbor. We played it together and found one of the blue pieces is warped and does not sit flush against the board. We tried to gently bend it but ended up snapping it in the process. We super glued it for her as a temporary fix.I don‚Äôt really want to ask for the gift back in order to exchange it so I am trying to figure out how to replace just the broken piece. I could order the $4.00 bag of blue replacement tiles from the manufacturer‚Äôs website but 1) I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay more just it came this way and 2) I don‚Äôt know if the blokus ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù pieces are the same size as the standard.What a pain.Update: I ended up buying a second game so I could swap out the tile with my neighbor and then  I just kept the game with the broken tile. I‚Äôm glad that I did not order the $4 piece bag from the manufacturer. I visited another family over Thanksgiving and saw they had the original, non-deluxe version that is available in store. Holy smokes, that board is tiny! The pieces are tiny! I wish I could have done a by side photo, the replacement tiles would not have fit at all.So, in the end we kept the game with the defective piece. We think of our friends every time we see it even though they moved away. Having now seen the original version, I would NEVER buy it or recommend that anyone else buy it. It is microscopic in comparison and would only be good if you are an ant. Buy this deluxe model, check all the tiles, and you‚Äôll be good to go.

  I went on a hunt to find age/family appropriate games. My children are 13 and 11 and we like to play games, especially those that have an ""even"" playing field (vs trivia, etc.). The reviews were good for this and I'm so glad I bought it! We were able to open, read the instructions and start playing quickly (I can't stand when you have to consult the directions a ton of times because people are confused). It starts out simple enough but towards the end, we all realized how much more strategy we should have used from the beginning! The second match was much more interesting once we ""got"" it.My son even played it the next day by himself, trying to place as many of the pieces as he could on the board.

Where has this game been all my life?!
","

  I have watched bloggers and instagram influencers rave about this game.  I didn't really think we would love it that much, and wasn't excited about dropping $25.00 on a game, but then Covid happened and we needed some new games.  So I took the plunge.  With that being said, it's a REAL HIT!!  It gets used at least 5 days a week currently and we can play for up to two hours in a sitting.  The games are pretty quick, so in that two hour time span, we can average 4-7 games.  Our son is 15 and our daughter is 9, both of them highly enjoy this game, as well as my husband and I.  The rules and instructions were super simple and basic.  By our second time playing we felt like pros.  I'm not sure where this game has been all of my life!  Super fun, and really gets your brain thinking constantly to you next moves.I do think that $25.00 is a bit much price wise.  $15.00-20.00 seems more realistic, but considering how much playing time it is getting, I'll chalk it up as a win.The plastic pieces are great quality.  I do worry that the grey playing board will eventually crack, so we are just being careful with it.  Also the box seems a little on the flimsy side.  Minor yes, but once a game box is ruined that's bothersome to me.  So we will treat this with extra care.Aside from me thinking the price is a little high, and the flimsy box, I would not hesitate to gift this game to our family friend to enjoy as well!

An adequate version of this game.
","

  The board in this set measures 11 3/4 inches square, not the promised 13 inches square.  The board does have the full 400 squares.  The pieces are less substantial and a bit smaller than in the original version, although I wouldn't call them fragile.  There are 21 pieces of each color, as their should be.  So this may not be the version, physically, you are thinking about if you have played this game somewhere else.  However, this is still the same fun game to enjoy with friends or family.  Keep in mind that Blokus really is a game for four players.

  Fun game, but was delivered without any packaging at all. The game arrived with the ships labeled attached right to the game box. There was no plastic protecting it, so it‚Äôs a big white sticker mess stuck on the brand new game for ever. The box isn‚Äôt that strong, so it is slightly dented as well. I can‚Äôt give it now as the Easter Bunny gift I was planning on. We played it as a family game and it was fun.

  Ordered ""blokus classic"" (the larger version pictured here) and paid about $35 for it.  Was sent the smaller, newer, cheaper version instead.  I could have gotten that version much cheaper anywhere else.  I must agree with the other reviewer who said this is a typical bait & switch.  I am attempting to send it back. I'm not sure if the classic version is available anywhere at all.  I guess there's no way to tell for sure what you'll get from the seller.  It's not like I didn't check first, I tried.

Attached shipping labels directly to game box, not cool

  We bought the game because we had fun playing it with friends. The game itself is great! I highly recommend it. What I am not happy about is that Amazon affixed the three shipping labels directly to the game box and just taped the game box shut (not even any plastic wrap between the stickers and the box). After a few aggravating moments I was able to peel the shipping stickers off, but now I have sticky residue all over the box. Amazon, for board game enthusiasts the integrity of the game box is VERY important. You are going to have very unhappy customers if you ship games out this way.

  Our 5-year old can play it but it's also lots (more?) fun for us adults! The only issue we have with it that it is for four people. If you play it with three people then you have to take turns (across rounds) in playing the fourth player. The person who is in between the two other real players has therefore a disadvantage! So unfortunately, we have stopped playing it. Bummer!

... Deluxe Blokus Game for my family and we absolutely love it. This game can be played by everyone
","

  I bought Deluxe Blokus Game for my family and we absolutely love it.  This game can be played by everyone.The game is played on a square board divided into 20 rows and 20 columns, for a total of 400 squares. There are a total of 84 game tiles, organized into 21 shapes in each of four colors: blue, yellow, red and green.  The game tiles have 1 to 5 made up of different shapes.  The idea of the game is to strategically place these odd shaped tiles on the board and try to get rid of as many pieces as you possibly can.  In order to put down a tile it needs to touch the corner of the same colored tile that you are playing.  You can play this game with 2 to 4 people.  Each person getting the same amount of tiles and each person is represented by a color.  Once you cannot play any more of your tiles you are out of the game.  The individual with the least amount of tiles in their hands wins.  It is a game that can be played on many different levels even up to the highest of strategies.  I would recommend this game to anybody who is looking to find a fun family friendly game.

  Blockus is a classic game, but after the initial release, Hasbro sold a smaller version that was just annoying. For many years I felt I couldn't gift this game to anyone because it was too small and that made playing it difficult.Finally, after years of waiting, they've re-released the bigger version. It's still not ""quite"" as big as the original, but it's close enough for me to feel comfortable buying again. My girlfriend was overjoyed when this showed up on her doorstep!

Blokus helps kids be smart
","

  I am an instructor for the Summer Institute for the Gifted and at SIG I teach game strategy to 5-6 year old gifted children.  One of the games I use in this course is Blokus.  I highly recommend Blokus to any parent who wants to help their 5-7 year old have fun learning to be smart.The beauty of Blokus is that the rules are incredibly simple so a young child can learn them quickly, in under two minutes, and yet the strategy and thinking levels needed to get increasingly better at this game are quite complex.  This combination is exactly what makes a great game to teach critical thinking skills to young children.  Specifically, Blokus helps children develop spacial reasoning abilities, problem solving and perseverance.  It also can begin to develop thinking ahead skills.  But, this game is as hard as your child is ready for in that a child can play it and have fun before these capabilities are fully developed and have a blast while improving these skills and as their skills increase they can engage the game at higher degrees of complex thought.  With repeated play, you will see your child's thinking skills improve.My oldest daughter just turned five and we gave this to her for her birthday yesterday.  We have already played four times.  She loves it and we love seeing her work through the spatial constraints and opportunities the board gives you each turn.  You will hit a homerun if you give Blokus to your child as a gift both as a fun parent and a parent who helps to raise a smart child.

Fun For the Whole Family
","

  I bought this game along with a batch of other games for the holidays to have for family and friends to play after meals and by far, it was the one that received the most play time over Thanksgiving.  I wanted to have games that had quick rounds (~20-30 minutes) so that everyone could play and rules that were easy to learn and explain.  It's a great little game to have on your shelf as it's easy to jump in and play and easy for players of all ages to enjoy.While the concepts seem simple at first blush, the great thing about Blokus is that there's really no one right way or one right strategy to winning the game and everyone has a chance to win a round because of the dynamic nature of the game.My wife and I bust it out and play two-player rounds by the fire once in a while as well.If you like this type of game, I'd also recommend Rumis which is very similar to this game by plays in 3-dimensions instead of 2.  It's another great game that's easy for players of all ages to jump into and play.

Simple yet intriguing!
","

  I purchased this for my family for Christmas after reading all the positive reviews and awards it has won.  I wondered how anything this seemingly simple could be fun and hold the interest of kids who are conditioned to instant excitment from video games and adults whose choice of toys are electronic devices of some sort.  Let me first say that this is not one of those games where everyone will be chomping at the bit to open up and play after unwrapping it at Christmas time.  The game is basically a gray plastic box with a grid and various plastic shapes grouped into 4 different colors, similiar to Tetris pieces that you place on the grid.  Nothing fancy to look at and kids will probably push this present aside until all the other ""flashy"" toys are opened and played with.  But once they do, everyone will enjoy this very engaging, thought provoking, challenging, and addicting game and will want to play it time and time again.  It's rare to find such an intellectual game where all ages can compete.  The box says 5 to adult but to really appreciate the strategic content of the game, I would say that 8 to adult is more accurate.  It can be played as one game which takes about 15-20 min where the idea is to get rid of all or most of your pieces.  The ones left over are tallied with the player with the fewest points being the winner. Or you can play a set of games where points are tallied from each game and a winner is decided.  You place your shapes on the grid one at a time where they must touch another one of your pieces diagonally.  Play is then based on alternate pieces placed by each player..max 4 players.  Super fun, as challenging as the opponents are capable of, and a great framily game.

  I absolutely love this game! My oldest son is 7 1/2 and I am so glad that the days of candy land and cootie are gone and the days of blockus are here!!!!! This game is so much fun to play.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it had so many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  I was not disapointed.  The whole family likes it, but grandma, mom, and 7 yr old are completely hooked.  The strategy is addictive. I see the puzzle shapes in my sleep:) The more you play, the more strategy you pick up, but you don't even realize that until you've been playing for a while. I ordered qwirkle at the same time and we much prefer blockus! I especially like that it is basically self scoring. unlike quirkle, where you have to add up keep a running tally of your points.  Blockus is much easier for my 7 yr old to play with a friend or brother without adult assistance.The only negative I have is that the best way to play is with 4 players.  You CAN play with 2,or 3, but then the players have to double up and be in charge of 2 colors.  I would not let this keep you from getting the game, but just something to consider.

  The games itself is fun and challenging especially for a geometry challenged person like myself. The game box looked like it was used. The corners and edges of the box were slightly worn and there were tape marks on the edge of the box. With that being said I really wanted the original version of the game...the one before the company ""updated"" the playing board. Previous reviewers noted how the original version had a larger playing surface and that is what I wanted. All the game pieces were their and in good shape so I didn't feel a need to return it. My 16 year old who is not a geometry person either won the game the first time she played it...her challengers had all played it several times already. She is a visual person which helped her in this game. It is a great and unique addition to our game library.

  We love Blokus! I bought it while looking for games that would be educational. This game requires strategy to win but you can play with younger kids no problem. Unusually play it with my 10 and 6 year old. It is hardest to play with 4 people because it gets harder and harder to find spots for your pieces. With the three of us we could usually get all our pieces down. With the two kids playing on their own, much easier.I grew up playing games like Tetris, dr. Mario, bejeweled etc so I always look forward to Blokus. You don't put the pieces together like Tetris but it requires strategy in fitting all your pieces on the board.I like that it doesn't take that long to play a round and it is not too involved. Once you learn the rules you can quickly start having fun .

  We opened this early Christmas eve when we and the visitors - adult daughter and her friend  - were at the point when everyone had run out of news and other things to occupy the time.  We all needed a diversion.  Boy did this game fit the bill!  We are in our 60s, and my daughter and friend in their 20-30s, but it was a game all ages could really get into.  I suspect it would well down to early teen or younger.  All through the game my daughter's friend kept exclaiming, ""We're getting this as soon as we get home!""  Every free moment for the rest of this visit was involved in playing Blokus.  My daughter and her friend were so enthusiastic we finally offered to let them take the game home since it was clear they'd be inviting everyone over to it.  High points are that games are short enough, even with 4 players, that no one get's bored (maybe 20 minutes or so with 4 playing), nor stuck playing a game they need to or want to leave.  You can play nicely with 2, 3 or 4 people, though I think 4 likely works best.  But beware ""mature"" folks - your kids can likely beat the pants off you!

Good family fun
","

  From reading the description of this game online I was a little confused what they meant by only allowing pieces to touch at the corners because it wasn't readily apparent to me that most of the pieces consist of multiple joined squares in various configurations (think tetrus). Having said that, once you see the game the rules are quite simple and can be learned in a few minutes. Adults can play a challenging game, but 2 adults can readily play with 2 kids because the adults will focus on blocking each other in and hence the [ignored] kids could well end up winning. Best with 4 players, but 2 works pretty well too.Caveats: the playing pieces are bit flimsy, so kids who aren't careful could break some pieces, but replacement pieces are easily (and cheaply) available. Also, the scoring rules are a bit more complex than the playing rules, so when we play with kids we just say whoever is the last one able to make a move is the winner (and 2nd last one gets 2nd place, etc).

Fun game to play for 4 people
","

  This is a fun family game that needs 3-4 people to play.  I strongly recommend 4 people, as any less makes it too easy for everyone to win (thus having two+ winners at the end of the game).The object of this game is to get rid of all your colored tiles.  If you have any tiles left over at the end of the game, you count up the blocks, and that's your score.  The person with the lowest score wins.You can play this game with kids, wives, and buddies.  This game does not demand too much attention, so you can casually talk while playing this game too.  The game is strategic though, and also very addictive.  When you finish one game, you'll all want to play it ""one more time"", then ""one more time"" again.I bought this game for $30 in the local mall, but it's nice to see Amazon will delivery it with FREE SHIPPING for even less money (AND NO TAX).  I strongly recommend this game.  You'll definately look at it and say ""I bet it took $1 to make this game"", but the game is so much fun to play.  My family asks that I bring this game every time we have a game night.

  This is a fun and interesting puzzle game. I normally play with my two sons (5 and 8). The game is trivially easy to pick up and play even for children. The scoring rules are simple.This is definitely a challenging game due to the complex interactions between colors on the board. However, I found that even my children were able to grasp the basic strategies of leaving their options open for later in the game, blocking other players, and saving the little pieces for last when the board is so full you can't place the big pieces anywhere.I read the reviews before I bought it, and one person recommended shrinking the board by one square on each side for a three-player game and two squares all around for a two-player game. The board is clearly balanced for four players, but that idea works well enough.

  This wasn't a cheap game, it wasn't put in a box and they put the shipping label right on the game box! It's corners are all bashed up and looks like something old that you'd get from a garage sale. Sending it back and will buy it somewhere else!

Blokus Makes You Lose Friends
","

  As one of my friends says ""Blokus makes you lose friends."" Our games can get pretty intense and stressful, which is all part of the fun! Or maybe it was the beer talking. Yes, we can turn any game into a drinking game.The game has simple rules, is easy to pick up, and actually involves strategy and THINKING! That's why it's MENSA approved. You can have fun and feel like a smarty pants at the same time! I especially like that each game takes less than 30 minutes so the game never feels tedious. If there was a negative, I think it would be that the game plays best with 4 people and isn't quite the same with 2 or 3.The board and pieces seem pretty durable and are sure to provide years of entertainment. Whether you're 13 or nearly 30, like we are, Blokus is a good time all around.

  Excellent game for the mind.  Really makes a person think and strategically plan out their moves. Every game is different.  No repeat board situations.  As far as for a travel game, it's ok for a table but not for playing in a car.

  This appears more like a cheap fake. The game box is of very poor quality, the quality of the components is also poorer than the original Mattel version.Overall, if you've ever played Blokus, you won't enjoy this game.If you've never played it and this option is priced better at the moment, get it and you'll enjoy it because the game itself is great.

Sturdy wooden set and worth the price
","

  This is exactly what it says it is. There isn't a good description on the Amazon page, so here:1. The board is fairly sturdy. It's a thick one, not just cheap like I guessed when looking at the box.2. All 4 tile racks are made of unfinished pine and feel like they need to be sanded once more.3. All 100 tiles were present in their correct amounts per letter. The tiles are made of smooth and finished wood.4. Mine came with a cloth tile bag and a game guide.This isn't an expensive version of Scrabble, but if you don't mind playing with wooden pieces instead of the old heavy plastic, it's great. Definitely worth what you pay for it.

SPECS, AND COMPARING THIS GAME TO SCRABBLE PURCHASED OVER 40 YRS AGO
","

  I am comparing the Scrabble game by Hasbro Gaming in a bright red box with white ""SCRABBLE"" on front and pictures of lots of letter tiles that I purchased on July 13, 2019 ..... ANDa Scrabble game I purchased over 40 years ago that came in what I consider a purple box, some may call it dark burgundy or dark wine.  My old game has gold lettering on the box, no pictures, and the box is kind of a textured cardboard, not smooth and glossy.COMPARISON:For anyone who just wants the main two differences without reading everything:1.  The new game has a larger board, but the actual playing area of the board is almost the same.The new board has a wider strip down one side to say ""SCRABBLE"" and to tell you how many of each letter there are.  It tells you this on both sides of the border, facing the player who sits on either side.2. The new game has lightweight red plastic racks to hold your letters. My old game has heavy duty wooden racks.  Both WORK fine, but I  prefer wood personally.If you want more exact specs and differences, as well as what HASN'T changed, read on:Old Board measures a tad over 14 1/4  x 14.  The actual playing area is  12 1/4 x 11.New Board measures just shy of 15 1/2  x 14.  The actual playing area is 12 1/2 x 11 1/4.Both boards fold in half.  Mine is still in great condition. Hopefully new board will hold up as well.The backside of the old board is purple (or wine?). The back side of the new board is black.The instructions are printed inside the lid on the old game; on a nice brochure in the new game.The box for the old game measures 14 1/2 x 7 1/2 and is kind of textured heavy duty cardboard.The new game box measures 15 3/4 x 7 1/2 and is a lighter weight standard cardboard game box.The old game tells you only on one end of the board how many of each letter, so it is upside downand hard to see for the person sitting on the opposite side. The new board has it printed on both ends of the wide border, facing in the direction of the person sitting on either side, so it's easy to read for both.The Double Letter, Double Word, Triple Word colored squares on the board are the same on both.The letter tiles are the same size in both and definitely look and feel like wood to me, in both.  There are 98 letters and 2 blanks in both games, and the same number of each letter in both games.  (There are more of commonly used letters such as vowels, especially E and A, and N's and R's.  And only one of letters like J, Q, X and Z, but the same number of each letter in both games.)The really big difference:  the nice wooden racks in the old game vs. the cheap red plastic racks in the new game. Although I greatly prefer the wooden ones, I did not deduct a star for three reasons:  1, people who have never used the old game with wooden racks would probably think nothing of the plastic ones since most games these days have everything plastic everything.  (Had the letter tiles been plastic, I WOULD have deducted a star!)  2, the plastic racks get the job done, no problem. 3, the price of this game, $11.99 when I bought it, is very reasonable for what you get, so it wouldn't be fair to expect the same quality of a game you pay considerably more for.The letters look to me like they are printed in slightly larger, thicker type on the new tiles, which is a GOOD thing.  Still black letters, against very light wood tiles, which is best.The new game came with a black drawstring back, plenty large enough to hold all the letters with ease. My old game did not come with a bag, but I am fine with keeping them on the bottom of the box under the board.I consider this game a good value for the money and I would definitely recommend it, although I would point out to anyone I recommended it to that it has plastic racks, so they aren't disappointed.

  I am 76 years old and had not played Scrabble in many years, but my daughter in Mia ordered one and we played together when I went for a visit.  I beat her.  Has since played with another daughter and a grand-daughter and beat them also.  It is great to keep your mind active and lots of fun also.

Functional, but does not hold a candle to the older version.
","

  I bought this for my family because our old board was split on the crease. The set also had a ""patina"" to it that everyone loved, but I know that it is food and dead skin cells and that is gross as french toast. This version does not replace what we had. The board is a major improvement, since it is not split down the middle. The trays are plastic, which is probably my biggest objection. There are actually four of them, which was news to me as our old set only had three trays with it. The letters are wood, which is good, but they are just printed on and not engraved like the old set. That is probably a good thing because now nobody will spend ten minutes picking his or her letters pretending like they aren't trying to feel for the letter she or he wants. The font is wrong. Also, between the new board and the new tiles, they whole thing is very slippery. So if you breath real hard on the board, the tiles go every which way. I'm used to needing to make adjustments to the letters, but not to this extent. The new board and tiles allow for room between the tiles and that sucks. With the old set, you could lay the tiles touching and they all fit fine. The bag is flimsy, but we have an unopened Crown Royal, so it will be replaced soon. It isn't all bad. The game works, all the pieces were there. I think I will invest in a better version some time in the near future.

Classic in Name Only
","

  I ordered this game to use at the monthly ""Secret Headquarters Comics and Games for Everyone Off-Site Game Night"" in Tallahassee.  (Yeah, it's a long name, but now Brian, our Genial Host, owes me one!)  Anyway, I brought Scrabble, mainly because I did not know how to play any of the other games.When we opened it up, I think we were all expecting the look and feel of the ""classic"" Scrabble of our childhoods.  You know, heavy, smooth finished tiles and tile racks and a game board that felt like it could take years of carting around and gaming.This game is sort of a lightweight version.  Everything is there, but it's just feels a bit small and less substantial .  The tiles and racks have minimal finish on them, and the board is thinner.Now, as far as playing, this is a fine set.  However, do not be expecting the original-feeling Scrabble game.  I think if you want the truly ""classic"" set, you have to spend a little more.Why 4 Stars:  The product lives up to its description (if not my nostalgic expectations).  The price is right, and amazon delivered in a timely manner.Problem:  This may be an isolated problem; however, one of the tile racks was missing.  When I alerted amazon to this, as per its usual excellent customer service, it immediately arranged a replacement game to be sent to me. That's another reason for 4 stars--I love good customer service.BTW, I learned to play two new games last Friday:  Flux and Ticket to Ride Europe.  And by ""learned,"" I mean that I lost my shirt.  I will have to see if amazon carries these games, so I can catch up on some of this new-fangled stuff!UPDATE-24 hrs. later: The replacement Scrabble game has arrived, and all 4 tile racks are there!

  The tiles have the letters printed on instead of engraved and painted. They, and the bag that they come in, have been outsourced to China.The board is flimsy. Scrabble has gone from a quality product to a shadow of what it used to be. Instead of something to keep in the family and use for years, it's now got a disposable feel to it.It would be better to spring for a used older version from Ebay or a garage sale than to buy a new, cheapo version.Maybe they want to nudge you to get the turntable edition (which is very handy), since it is so much more expensive.

  Returned and bought the ""deluxe"" version.  This board is flat and does not spin, so the tiles slide all around when moving it around (or someone has to read the board upside down).  Pay the extra for the board with recessed game spaces, so the tiles don't move.  The deluxe version also rotates on wheels.

  I grew up playing scrabble and always loved it. Sadly my daughter recently told me that we seriously dropped the ball in her board game education. Amazon to the rescue, I ordered the game and it was delivered the very next day. I can happily say we have played many games of scrabble and she loves it just as much as I do.The board is a little flimsy but you just have to be careful.

  I purchased this game purely for the tiles. I already have two sets of Scrabble tiles that I use for my spelling and word work centers in my classroom. I can live with the plastic trays (although I prefer the wooden ones, like the ones I already have). My biggest complaint is that the tiles are all wrong! They are about 1mm longer and wider than the original tiles. The tiles are painted, not embossed. The font is wrong. If I had wanted tiles like this, I would have purchased one of the multitudes of cheaper options available, and bought hundreds of tiles. I cannot mix these tiles with the ones I already have, because they DO NOT MATCH. I am an unhappy customer with this set.

  I had a treasured old English Scrabble set (green box by Spears) with heavy smooth blocks & rounded edges, excellent thick quality board and plastic letter ledges I had been given by an old friend when I was a boy, and had kept in pristine condition. My ex kindly took it. So I researched, and was strongly considering buying the exact replacement, or the American version (red/burgundy). I elected to save my hard-earned dollars & buy the $14 model here. I couldn't be happier. Board is reasonable quality; wood letters are sunken & embossed; plastic shelves are reasonable quality. What's not to like at fourteen dollars over 60 bucks?

She also makes words on her tray, but still has a little trouble with placing them on the board.

The buzzer was an improvement, but it's still missing the card-holder.
","

  I'm glad to see the buzzer finally come back - the version that was being sold with the little rubber chewtoy was a joke. However, it's still missing another key component that was in the original Taboo game and that is the plastic holder that allows you to easily hold a number of cards and gives you space to flip them up what at a time. It sounds like no big deal, but it's easy to waste time fumbling to get the next card or accidentally drop the card you just finished and the holder the old game had solved these issues.And in case you're curious, no - these cards aren't the same size as the old ones, they are slightly bigger, so you can't just reuse the old holder with the new cards.

  This review is for people who are a fan of the ""old"" taboo. Yeah, this one comes with a buzzer, which apparently is a big deal. But no card box, no score pad and no timer.

Classic game, but could use some improvements
","

  We were big fans of the original Tabboo, but all the 90s pop culture clues from that one were hopelessly out of date (we were playing with our kids and had to explain who Monica Lewinsky was, lol).  This version solves that by removing almost all people and proper nouns.  But it has a few shortcomings:1. They recycled a bunch of words from the original version.  Not a big deal, but paying for a new game it would have been nicer to get all new words/clues.2. They did not include the plastic car holder in this version.  This makes it harder to give clues, pass the cards around, etc.  ""No problem,"" we thought, ""we'll just use the holder from the original game.""  But the manufacturer inexplicably made the cards about 1/16 of an inch wider in this version, so they just barely don't fit in the old card holder.  Annoying for something that could have been fixed cheaply.At least this version comes with a buzzer.

  This is a great game for a group game night. It is sophisticated enough for the adults and teens but even the younger players were able to join in and have fun. We play in teams of 3 persons and made sure the groups had a mix of ages. It was hilarious! When the game was over everyone wanted to play again.  The idea here is to describe a key word without using any of the other words listed on the card  ( the ""Taboo"" words) in a certain amount of time- there is a timer included in the game. There are a series of cards and you need to see how many of the key words can be correctly guessed by your team in the allotted time.

  This is a game of communication and vocabulary under high stakes time limits and omission of certain forbidden words.  The excitement stems from the words that are forbidden in the description.

Overall...A Step Back from the Original
","

  We've always loved the Taboo game and have played it numerous times over the years. We were excited about this new edition but it was kind of disappointing. The positive: a new set of cards with updated subjects. This was good. The negatives: the new game does not include a card display holder, which means you either have to leave it on the table or the player has to hold it...which makes it difficult; and 2) the timer provides much less time than the original. We now use the old timer w/ the new cards. We tried to use the old card hold but it doesn't fit. Looks like the company got cheap and it shows. Too bad.

  If you're familiar with the other versions of TABOO.... and we have them all since we LOVE the game, you'll notice there is no box for the cards and there is no pass-around box to play out of.  That would be fine except these cards don't fit in the pass-around box from the previous games!!  I've had to cut down every single card so it will play like the previous versions.  SUGGESTION TO HASBRO - Instead of recreating the game, just do new card sets in the 2x5"" cardboard storage box that fit into the existing pass-around play box.

Fun Family Activity

  We decided to take our daughters (ages 10 and 11) to a real escape room for Mother's Day this year. We wanted to give them a little practice first, so we got this game. Our girls enjoyed the Jumanji movie, so it looked like a fun theme. This game was outstanding! This set comes with 3 different adventures with a battery operated box that counts down your time, plays jungle sounds while you play, and alerts you if you enter the correct answers to move on or not. It starts with a small 15 minute introduction game to get you used to have to solve puzzles in a time limit. These were easy enough for my 10 & 11 year olds to mostly do on their own. They got the hang of it pretty quickly and wanted to jump right in to the next adventure! The other 2 included adventures are both full 60 minute games. These adventures follow the storyline of the newer Jumanji movie where you get sucked into a video game and have to find your way out. The next adventure was not as easy. It was quite doable but we did get hung up in a few places. All in all, I recommend this for a family game night. You can reprint all the papers you write on throughout the game from their website, so I did and repackaged it up for a friend to borrow and do with their family. Great feature from this set so it is reusable to share. One con is that if you use the box to time yourself, every time you put in a wrong answer, it takes away a minute from your countdown. That does not happen in real escape rooms. So we lost a few minutes that way and only finished with 37 seconds to go! I would prefer it not take away time. I recommend using your own timer also so you can accurately see what your real time would have been, but the box is needed to check your answers and sets some ambiance with the jungle noises as well. Otherwise, I found this to be put together nicely, has cute puzzles that even kids can help with and enjoy, and follows the Jumanji theme very closely.

  This game itself was fun but it was not clear that the included game pieces would not enable playing of expansion packs. I purchased this expecting that the Chrono Decoder and keys would be the same as the original version of the game, but this version only includes 8 keys (versus the original version that includes 16). We got over halfway through the Funland expansion and then spent 20 minutes trying to resolve a correct answer because we only had half as many keys as we needed (so were missing a key to proceed to part 3). Very frustrating and disappointing experience. Why not just include the additional 8 keys to make this functional for expansion packs?

  I purchased this game partly because of the movie. I seen in a lot of other reviews that they said that the game was falling apart ours did not. Though the middle part is really cheaply made plastic if you were to accidentally put your weight on it it would break without a second thought. You have to take the card and slip it under the reader to be able to read what is on the cards some people may have difficulty reading it. With three of us playing in less than an hour we were completely done with the game. We did have some fun though. It's now in the closet and we may never play it again, may just have been a waste of money.

  I bought four of these (was I crazy?!) to use at my daughter's ninth birthday party so the girls could play in teams of 4. She loves the Jumanji movies and was so excited to try this out. Things might have worked if there were enough parents around to guide them. Definitely not for 9-year-olds to complete alone as the directions were confusing (they were meant to be to make it challenging). The timing factor made things stressful for them and cooperating in a group of four was just about impossible. And these are really smart (and maybe a little bossy) girls.  I had one leftover game we didn't use at the party so we tried it today. It wasn't impossible, but it took us way more than an hour. And though the timer continues to count if you go beyond the hour time limit, the machine shut off by itself in the middle of a clue so we couldn't check our answers. You can't run through the game ahead of time to be sure this would work for a group of kids since you'd then be tearing apart items and writing on the papers so it really is a one-time use game. And I admit, there were times we had three of the keys down pat, couldn't figure out the fourth, so we just kept guessing until the controller dinged that we had gotten the combination right.  Honestly, my daughter would not stop talking and making guesses during the whole thing that I couldn't concentrate properly! Lol! She was eager to try and didn't give up easily, but it was stressful even with just two of us working on it. I gave up after the fourth task and put my husband in charge of working the rest out with her. She kept at it and enjoyed it....even after 90 minutes.  Older kids might enjoy it, but even they might need a parent's help.

The game it's self is fun but slightly confusing
","

  Game was well packaged and delivered quickly but the game it's self though brand new was missing a pawn piece (red) and the decoder had fallen off of the central board piece. We contacted the manufacturer for a replacement board piece and just glued the decoder back together. The game it's self is fun but slightly confusing. We enjoyed playing it but not sure if we played it exactly right.

  This game is really cool. If you like the movie, you'll like this game as well.

  Fluxx is my FAVORITE game. I have original Fluxx, Doctor Who Fluxx, and now Jumanji Fluxx. Jumanji Fluxx has the most durable cardboard box. It's beautiful. It makes a great gift for anyone who loves Jumanji and has time to play games. The biggest difference between the other Fluxx games I have and Jumanji Fluxx is that (because you get 3 lives in the Jumanji game) you can get eliminated and have to start over. (This also makes it easy for anyone to jump into a game at any time.) It adds an intriguing twist to Fluxx that I love. We will definitely enjoy playing this for years to come. I'm just wondering if they're going to create a Jumanji 2 expansion pack, now that Jumanji: The Next Level is out, because I would totally buy it.

Decoder stopped working quickly.
","

  Although we enjoyed the game, we were only able to play it because we had an additional decoder from a different escape the room game. The decoder no longer worked after the first 15 min game. Kids were disappointed because the jungle sounds on this one are fun, but never responded when we added keys. Luckily the answers are on the hint cards. Will be asking for a replacement decoder. Hopefully customer service is not bad too. The game itself is pretty fun. Little easier than the 16+ games.

Great variation of Fluxx
","

  I was very pleasantly surprised by how well this game balances still being Fluxx but also fitting with the Jumanji theme.This game is clearly still Fluxx (same general principles and gameplay), but it has a few variations that make it interesting (the danger cards and meta rules, plus labeling some keepers as adventurers or animals).As with other versions of Fluxx, it's playable pretty much by anyone who can read. I play most often with my nieces and nephews 9+.One thing to know is that with the danger cards, players can be ""eliminated"" which is kind of like dying or getting ""out."" Some kids might get upset about losing all their cards, but at least until you get through the first draw pile, players come back after one full round, so they don't necessarily lose when they get eliminated.

  There is so many small tiny pieces that even perforated they are super hard to tear out! Definitely recommend doing so before starting the game! Spent more time ripping pieces out then actually playing. So that whole level will have to be replayed. Praying none of the pieces get lost. Plus there is really only 2 games in this one. The third one is a short one sided walk through. I definitely recommend the original set over this one!

Good. Others of same brand are better.

  My family has played a lot of this brand (and other) room escape games. These were definitely much easier. The 15 minute tutorial only took 7, and that was with letting the 7 year old do the main puzzle. Not very challenging. The second game was the hardest of the 3. Third only took us 35 of the 60 minutes. Since it‚Äôs only playable once, it felt like we wasted money on it. Unless you have pretty young ones playing with you, buy any of the others instead.

  Playing the first game we figured out how to play afterwards because the directions weren't clear enough. Playing the second game we realized you have to destroy parts of the game to solve the puzzle. So you can never let a friend play the same game.

  I used to play this with a few of my friends years ago and remembering we had so much fun.  I decided to get it again to play with my family over 10 years later.  It is what it says it is, all games rolled into one and then some.  You won't be disappointed.  A Lot of laughs.  D.S.

  Played for the first time for all of us with a group of diverse friends.  We found it confusing, disoriented, and hard to find any point of interest.  We stopped playing after about half an hour of being bored and not relating to the point of the game.  (We understood the point, just didn't find it interesting to pursue.)

Gentle and Sweet Documentary
","

  This is one of those feel-good documentaries that you put on when the world feels like it's too much. The director shows a lot of empathy for his subjects. One of the board games being featured has some problematic racial connotations. (My nice way of saying the mini-figs used and the title come off as racist despite the maker's own experiences informing the game.) Instead of shying away from confronting that aspect of the game, the director uses interviews with the creator as well as game executives to discuss the lack of diversity in gaming.Other aspiring designers are followed as well with varying degrees of success in selling their games either on their own or to major board game publishers. I do wish there was some follow-up at the end letting viewers know what the creators are up to now.All in all, it's a well-done glimpse at the development of tabletop games featuring interviews with many of the biggest names in the industry.

  The four designers featured are varied in their approach to the industry as well as their level of success which made for an interesting story. I also appreciated the focus on the industry itself, including input from so many well known game designers and publishers. And Tom Vasel üòä. The overall production value is quite high as well. You can tell they took their time and it paid off. Overall, very entertaining, especially for those who are fans of the hobby.

Quality issues corrected?
","

  I regretted clicking the purchase button once I found all of the negative reviews regarding the quality deterioration of this game, but I decided to take a chance anyway. I opened the box with baited breath to find that my components look... great! The chips feel hefty, the gem stickers are all present and have a lovely iridescence to them, and the cards feel nice and slick. I don't know if I happened to luck out and get an older game from before they reduced the quality, or if the company has gone back to using nicer components, but I am glad I took the chance! Three clues to look for if you decide to chance it as well: (1) my box says 'Space Cowboys' on the bottom side, not on the front cover like the product image shows. (2) Inside, there is a promotional pamphlet that says 'Space Cowboys 2017', and (3) the rulebook says it was produced in France. I hope others have success in getting a good quality version as well!

Some of the tokens didn't even come with any stickers.And to think I paid $40 for this cheaply produced game.

Good Game, Really Crappy Quality New Printing
","

  The game itself is good and definitely one that you should get if you are interested. HOWEVER.... the newer printings of it (which is what I received and what others undoubtedly will going forward) has had much of the materials dropped in quality. The insert (which was never necessary anyway) is crinkly cheap plastic, the printing is not as crisp, and (most glaringly) the previously lauded high quality poker-style gems chips are not crappy cheap plastic, with visible flashing, faded and inconsistent color, and are super light. Everything about the newer printings just screams ""cheap, lowest quality possible"".Sure, the gameplay is the same, there are so many other good games in the same price range that play well and aren't crappy quality.Definitely not worth more than $20.

Favorite Game in our Rotation!
","

  We were introduced to Splendor by a board game obsessed friend of the family.  We enjoyed playing it with him so much that we ordered our own copy.  I'd say our board gaming preferences are somewhat refined, because thanks to this friend we've played a LOT of games, and Splendor has been one of our favorites for a long time.My husband and I will get Splendor out for a best 2 out of 3 on a Sunday afternoon.  We'll break it out to play with our two kids for family game night. (The kids request it more than we do.  They are 12 and 8.)  When we took it to play with extended family over the holidays, my sister ended up buying a copy for her family too.  My competitive and strategic brother-in-law can enjoy plotting and trying to spy out what everyone else is doing, while my fun-loving, chatty sister-in-law can also enjoy the same game and still have a chance to win.Replayability is high with 2, 3 or 4 players.  The pieces are nice quality and ours aren't showing much wear despite it being the most popular game in our rotation for a couple of years.  Our friend took it with him overseas on an extended business trip.  It's fairly compact if you take everything out of the box and put it in a baggy.  Another thing I like about it is no one has ever ended up with hard feelings at the end, which happens sometimes with some of our other games where players are making verbal agreements or even working as a team.You can put as much or as little thought into each turn as you want, but in the end you are choosing between 3 actions:  buying a card, reserving a card, or taking chips.  This makes it easy for a new player to get the hang of it.Last, I'll add that it's extremely well balanced.  It's a numbers game where your choices in the early turns have a noticeable effect on your later game.  None of the cards are over-powered, I've seen lots of different strategies earn the win.  It's a great game and I'd definitely recommend it!

Love this game from the beginning
","

  Was looking for a bunch of new games to add to family game night.  I had always seen this game ranked highly so bought it as part of a bunch of games.  Confess, I didn't read the directions but watch a bunch of Youtube videos to get started.  Very engaging game to play.  My wife and I love it from the beginning and play it with kids 9 and 10 years old who both easily grasp it and unfortunately beat the pants off the parents.  My wife has won once and I have been shut out over the course of maybe 10+ games.  It's a credit to the game that I still like it even though I haven't won yet.  My youngest has won quite a few times so strange that with all my life experience I still can't muster a win, maybe it's better to be young and just keep strategy simple.  Very pleased with the game, quality, easy of learning.  The one thing that was a little clunky was the first few games everyone was hoarding jewels which makes the game very slow but later on we realized that that was not the right strategy and there many other ways to move the game forward.Game quickly shooting to the top of the family favorites.

  This particular Splendor game has far lower quality materials than the previous Splendor I got from 3 years ago. I'm not sure if whether the game maker has decided to reduce costs or if the seller is sourcing from a .The chip tiles are much lighter. The actual box is made with flimsier cardboard. The cards are less flexible and feel like worse quality. The game itself is playable, but it feels like such a downgrade from our previous Splendor game.

I have bought two copis of this fantastic, very accessible game that requires a dynamic strategy
","

  Fantastic game! This game is very accessible and easy to learn. We have introduced this game to about five or six other couples (at least half enjoyed the game so much that they also now own it). Typically, after a brief explanation, we play through the game once. By the second play through, new players are comfortable and able to try out their own strategies. The play time is fairly quick which is another benefit and allows more than one play in a game night. This speeds up the learning curve greatly.However simply the game is to learn, there are plenty of strategies to play with and interesting dynamics that force players to make adjustments to their plans. For example, the available economic resources are adjusted depending on the number of players, this means that if someone is hoarding a resource, diamonds for example, other players will not be able to get any more diamonds and may have to purchase cards other than cards that cost diamonds. Conversely, by hoarding those diamonds, the hoarder may slow his/her own progress in the game. The level of thought that comes into this game is often evidenced by near silence in the room; players are so engaged in their efforts that they forget to talk. Our groups, who are typically quite chatty, will often get laughs at how intense each person is.My final thought is a slight disappointment with the change in components. I have purchased two copies of the game. The first one had really heavy coins that felt good in your hands and spoke of quality to the user. The new version has lighter coins but perhaps more vibrant cards. A balance of the two copies would be preferred.

Great play value
","

  This is a fantastic game:-The rules aren't too hard to learn.-It has great play value.  I've played a rather embarrassing number of games, and it's still great fun.-It's as good with two people as it is with three or four (though the strategy differs somewhat).-Setup and cleanup are quick and easy.-You can play with forward-looking strategy and complex long-term plans or just sort of do whatever looks best at the moment, and though the latter won't win you as many games, it's still fun.-Luck is involved, but skill is more important, so the better players generally (but not always) win.  I think that's a mark of a good game.  And...the play structure is such that you can make the better players play to higher points, thus evening the field.  Though the rules don't suggest it, try having everyone play to 21 points sometimes.  It changes your strategy.-And though this isn't my most important concern...it's visually a very pretty game.LOVE IT!

  This built quality isn't the same. I bought it because I played this at my friend's place and the material quality was so nice. The chips feel so good in your hand, like professional poker chips.But this is noticingly difference. The chip feels plasticity and the card doesn't have nice finish like my friend's does.

Wish I would've ""let the Wookie win"" occasionally to keep it in rotation.
","

  At first, I wanted to give this 5-stars, because it was such a great hit at first, and I still do enjoy playing it. It's definitely a 5-star game *IF* you have a group of people with roughly equal strategy-gaming skills.Sadly, that does not describe my family. Over time, Splendor's depth of strategy turned out to be its Achilles' heel. My family grew tired of losing to me, and preferred other games with a better chance of them winning. Make no mistake, this game is not nearly as ""random"" or ""casual"" as it appears, and if you do master the strategies, you'll consistently dominate those who haven't. Just don't overpower the same ""casual"" people for too long, or it'll fall out of favor.Ticket to Ride and Dice Forge have both had more staying power for us in the 30-60 minute ""casual"" game category. However, despite the layer of dust currently sitting on my copy, it was totally worth the experience in the meantime.

My families new favorite game!

  My husband and I love to play this game. My 6 and 9 year old love to play this game. We all get excited to play this game. It is easy enough to learn for kids after watching adults play 2-3 rounds. My daughter loves that she can actually beat her parents in something. We love that the game constantly changes and uses strategy and thinking a few steps ahead- very good thing for our kids to learn. I like that my entire family can play it, where as most games we all can play are- franking boring for adults- and winning relies on the luck of the roll or card draw.This game was a hit at our family gathering (especially the 7-16 year old's) and all the pieces are big enough that they don't get lost and cleanup was easy. We had the tiny kids on teams with the adults. My siblings said they would probably purchase it as well since their kids liked it enough to play it for several hours.The specific version I received had tiles and firm cards with thick cardboard people cards.We love this game...in fact I think I am going to go play it with my kids now.

Nice game for the family and for casual gatherings--as long as there are no more than four!
","

  I first played this at a gaming convention and was struck by the ease of learning as well as the relatively fast play.  I then gifted my niece with this game, and we played it with family members with varying degrees of patience and gaming experience.While a couple of people struggled initially, by the end of the session, everyone felt comfortable with both rules and basic strategy.  The first game with 4 people lasted for about an hour.  The second game was a huge hit and lasted closer to 45 minutes, since players no longer had to think hard about the rules.There's a strategy involved, but it's not terribly deep.  With that in mind, it's an excellent board game for a wide range of casual gamers and is an excellent addition to a family game night.The only drawback is that the game is limited to 4 players.  No expansion exists that can bring the numbers up to 6, which is why I knocked off a star.

Once someone starts winning, kiss your chances goodbye
","

  While this game isn't terrible, I found that it to be just okay fun. Like Settlers of Catan, when someone gets on a good streak it is hard (but not as hard as Catan) for you to catch up. If you start falling behind, you can kiss your chances of winning behind. Still a good value for 30min of play. Not for two players, you need three or more in order for it to be fun. It would be a good ""filler"" game but not necessarily something that stands on its own.

  It doesn't take long to get the hang of it and it's really quite fun. Enough going on at a good pace that one stays engaged for the whole game. There is some strategy/prediction involved (which I like) but the randomization of the decks keeps player opportunities pretty balanced (for those who don't like strategy games). I think it tends to wrap up a little too quickly in the later stages (in being so focused on larger purchases, one might not realize that they won), but a game I quite enjoy playing several rounds in one sitting.

A great opener to a board game night
","

  This is a solid board game that is simple to learn and usually fun to play.  There are only three different actions you can take on your turn (similar to Ticket to Ride) and as a result, game play proceeds fairly quickly once everyone is accustomed to it.However, if you're looking for something deeply strategic, you may not find it here.  In my experience there are two main ways to win: rushing the high point cards to end the game as soon as possible, or holding out slightly longer to establish an economy base for yourself with zero-point cards, attempting to overtake those using the first strategy at the last second before they can end the game.  As a result I would say this is a good way to start off a board game night, but won't hold a candle to something like Puerto Rico.The copy I received had a pretty banged up box, as if it had been dropped on the floor and suffered water damage.  All other components were in fine condition.

Great game for a small group of people 10+
","

  This game has a really good balance of elements making it easy to learn for anyone (10 and up I'd say), but still requiring strategy. It has a small element of chance when it comes to what cards are put out, which is enough to throw off a strategy, but usually not enough to completely change who is in the lead. From what I saw, it seems that strategy would need to change game to game based on the initial cards put out, so it has high replay value. It's also a fairly quick game assuming you dont have any players that take five years to make a decision. I would rate this only slightly more difficult than something like ticket to ride.

Better Than Catan - Won't Ruin Friendships
","

  This game is one of my favorite board games right now. After a single game, most people will feel comfortable making decisions. After two games, most will start developing different strategies for success. Be prepared for a slow first game filled with uncertainty. After watching other players, or just playing with other inexperienced players, you'll start to get a handle on the many strategies available to win.Catan ruins friendships because trading and the robber can stifle the leading player as long as all other players collude to stop them. In this game, you can sabotage other players, but often at your expense.Experienced players can complete a game in 20-25 minutes. Inexperienced players might take 35 minutes or even a little more for the first game. What seems like a slow, lumbering start quickly accelerates to the finish.Overall, a very satisfying and mentally engaging game.

  This game is a favorite in my family. My kids (ages 16, 14, 11) rank it as their favorite, and my wife has it in her top 3. It's quick to play, easy to learn, and balances well strategy/engine building/luck. The cards are good quality, and the chips are fantastic quality (so much fun to play with if you're fidgety like me!). The rules are easy enough to understand from the rule book, but we found learning this game was easier watching a quick video online. Once one of us understood how it worked, teaching it to others has been easy. It's one they pull out for friends or family anytime games are mentioned. While only for 4 players (unless you follow some readily-available-online-5-player-variants), it works great with 2 or 3 as well. The game definitely shifts some dynamics based on how many are playing, which enhances its replayability factor. For kids or adults, or any combination of both, this is a must-have if you like board games!

Perfect game for two players that don't like to compete too much
","

  I have a ton of games in my collection...60 or 70 I'd say.  Always play them with my wife.  We tend to like games that are fun for both of us but not confrontational enough that someone feels bad when they lose.  We also don't like games that are super long and heavy.This game is perfect for us.  In fact, it might be the best game we own.  It's quick, fun, economic, has a little bit of interaction, and the build quality is excellent.  If I could only keep a handful of my games this would definitely be one of them.The only issue I have is that it's really easy to get enough points to end the game and you don't realize it.  You just play along and then both of you count your points and realize the game was over a long time ago.Other games that have a similar feel: Targi, Jaipur, Ticket To Ride Nordic, maybe Rivals for Catan.

BORING - the rules are unclear & incomplete
","

  We are a smart family who enjoys games of strategy. This game fails on every level, with the exception of the illustrations (nice work, Pascal) and the high quality of the materials. Clearly the rules were lost in translation, what the what? There are multiple gaps in the rules in addition to a total lack of clarity in the instructions (we had to read the rules several times then made up rules to account for the gaps and to make the game progress forward). We have nearly a hundred games and this is the first & only game that we unanimously say 'BORING.' It takes a long time to accumulate enough gem tokens to buy prestige points so the game really drags.

Loads of tense fun despite weak theme
","

  I could see what he was saving up for.  He was three points from victory and I had four to go.  I needed another turn after this one to get the last ruby I needed for my collection I knew a noble wanted to see.  Her patronage would give me the points I needed to win.  But if I didn't block my opponent, he'd win.  How close are the others?  The next guy is probably in the same boat I'm in.  Then I can't... maybe the guy I block will block the other guy.  ""If I can't have her no man shall""  I remembered the scene from LadyHawke before the wicked bishop of Aquila got his.  Hmmm...  Which am I?  the bishop or the former captain of the guard?  What am I thinking?  I'm a Jeweler! trying to make my way in the world.This is the only trouble with this often tense game.  You can see what people are planning, you are hatching plans of your own, but don't think much at all about the theme of the game.GAME PLAYYou start by picking up three different colored substantive poker chips- with pictured of various colored jewels.  or you can take two of the same color, if there's enough remaining after you take them.  Then you use these to pay the price for a card.  A card may cost two blues and a red and a green or four whites.  I mean they may cost rubies, diamonds, emeralds, etc. Each card you buy has a picture of a stone in the top right corner that acts like a poker chip of that color to be used in conjunction with the chips in the future.  Except that cards don't get returned to the supply.  Some cards also have point values associated with them.  There are three tiers of cards.  Good, better and best ones.  The best always have points.  Better often do, but have less.  The good ones seldom have a single point.  Whoever makes 15 or more points first triggers the game end.  Anyone needing last ups gets their... last ups and the final score is tallied.There are certain nobles laid out that look for certain card combinations.  The first to have three blues, three whites, and three reds cards gets to claim the noble.  So you are racing for those too.  One can win by ignoring the nobles and holding out for point scoring cards, so there is a little bit in the way of multiple paths to victory.One other thing you can do on your turn is take a wild stone and pull one of the cards from the supply that only you can buy later in the game.  This is usually used to stick it to another player.  Taking what they had finally saved up for.  However, it could be used to get the last red that you need but can't have since all the red poker chips are in the hands of other players.The trouble with sticking it to someone is that it takes your turn to do it.  While one guy did that to me to help his fiancee win the game, it was very tender, yes, but his game suffered for it.  I may have done some heavy trash talking and deserved to be ganged up on, but I digress.  And yes, I realize relationships are important, and we even buy crazy expensive jewels to show just how important they are to us...THEMEWhich brings us back to Splendor.  The first tier of cards features in repetitive, but beautiful, artwork for where the raw stone featured in the top right is originally harvested from.  The second tier of cards shows the people who prepare the stones.  The third tier is where they might be brought to market.But cards from every tier act the same, as far as game play is concerned.  Maybe the game could be re-themed as an automobile making game and the high tiered cards would require specific components made from lower tiers...  All that to say the theme feels weak to me.BALANCEIt does feel balanced at the very beginning.  Whoever goes first gets the first shot at buying the cheap cards, but after two rounds, everyone is into the groove and facing the same challenges of having the cards they want purchased by everyone else.DOWNTIMEYou've got to wait your turn, and people can pause to reflect on what they should do because someone just took the card they want.INTERACTIONNot much required by this game.  The resources to buy with and to be bought are fairly limited, so more tension is at the beginning.  The stakes get higher as the game progressesFOR MYSELFI love how easy it is to teach others.  I bought if after being blocked from winning, and others have bought it after I taught it to them.  There's lots to love, just not the theme.  My four year old loves to play this game with her older siblings.  It's a winner.

High replay value - friends can't get enough
","

  My friends simply can not get enough of this game.  I was first introduced to it in Australia & after months of being away decided to purchase it on Amazon.  The price definitely seems to fluctuate on it, so keep an eye out.Essentially you're a gem lord building an empire of mining facilities.  You pay gems to purchase these mining facilities.  Each mining facility then counts as a one-discount of that type of gem each time you purchase something in the future.  As you build up your infastructure (or engine), you can purchase more expensive cards & points. First to 15 points wins!Each turn you can do one of three things:1) take gems from the bank. Three different types (1 ruby, 1 emerald, 1 sapphire for example) or 2 of the same (2 sapphires or 2 rubies) Note: there must be 2 gems remaining in the pile if you do the 2 of a kind option. Ex. there are 4 sapphires in the bank so you could take 2 sapphires. Ex2. there are 3 emeralds in the bank, you cannot take 2 emeralds because this would leave less than 2 remaining in the bank.2) purchase a card (mining facility) by paying the cost at the bottom of the card3) reserve a face-up card on the board. You take it and can purchase it on a later turn instead of taking your regular turn. You also take a gold gem which is used as a ""wildcard"" gem in lieu of any gem requirement.Watch your opponents & predict what they'll do!Ease of learning: takes me 5-10min to explain the gameGameplay: quick.  People take turns rather quicklySkill: both novices and experts can play.  The game is highly dependent on what the other players do in the game.  The 2-player version involves the most ""skill"" as it's mono-e-monoBuild quality:  high. Smooth, nicely weighted gem tokens & colorful, easy-to-understand cards

From a 2-player perspective
","

  The game is simple, collect enough points to win. The strategy is ever evolving, collect what you need, while obstructing your opponent from gathering what they need.Since purchasing Splendor, my wife requests to play it most nights.  It's easy to set up and 2-player games can be had in 20 minutes or so.  We play it often enough that we have yet to put it with the other games, it just remains on the table day after day.  I'm not saying you will get that much play out of it, but finding a game that plays well as at 2-player can be tricky sometimes.Game play is simple, you do one of the following actions: take gem tokens (2 of the same color if 2 will also remain, or 3 of any 3 different colors), purchase a card, reserve a card and take a gold token (wild), or pay for a card previously reserved.  The general idea is to purchase enough lower level cards (they have color coded gems on them too) to be able to purchase upper level cards later on.  When purchasing, you give the bank back all token chips you use, but not the cards you use to make the purchase.  So if you end up with one of each 5 types (Onyx, Diamond, Ruby, Emerald, and Sapphire) and another card comes up that requires one token of each color, you have the ability to pay nothing for the card and place it in your pile.Reserving a card is what I really enjoy about the game.  If you are just one token shy of building the card you want or you think your opponent may want (or really need) a specific card, you can reserve it.  Take the card, place it face down and take a gold token.  On a later turn, when you have satisfied the cost of the card, you can pay the price and place that card in your inventory. The reservation of a card is limited to three (3) cards in reserve at any given time.  This can be a useful strategy when trying to thwart your opponent because they may build the card they need to achieve a ""Noble"" card.Noble cards are placed at the top of the card draw area.  The number of nobles is always the number of players plus one.  Each noble is worth 3 points.  So for a 2 player game, 9 points is sitting up there for the taking.  Each noble has a requirement that must be satisfied before it can be won.  These goals are in the number and type of specific cards you have acquired (such as 3-ruby cards, 3-onyx cards, and 3-diamond cards).  If your opponent is only 1 card away from a noble and you are trying to achieve the same one, you can reserve the card they need, and on your next turn try and build the card you need to win it.Overall, we typically play 3 rounds before my eyes hurt from studying the requirements of all the cards and my brain refuses to take any more (a little more than an hour).  At that point, I call it quits (until the next night).We have owned the game for 11 days now and have played it on 9 nights. I've got to find another 2-player game before we burn ourselves out.

  This is probably my go-to game whenever I want to introduce new players to the engine-builder style of game mechanic. There's a lot to like about this game.For starters, the components are of good quality. The tokens have a hefty feel to them, akin to weighted poker chips. The cards and artwork are decent. And the game itself is fairly straightforward. It's as easy to teach as it is to learn.This is often compared to Machi Koro and Century Spice Road. While they have similar game mechanics I feel they are each unique enough to justify owning all 3. But of the 3 Splendor is usually the first I introduce to new gamers.Overall, I'd rate it 5/5. No complaints from me. This game will have permanent residence on my gaming shelf.

Wonderful Light/Gateway Game
","

  A must-have game for any gamer's collection.  This game is almost always the very first game we pull out when introducing games to a new gamer.  Why?  It's simple to explain and uses familiar concepts of set collection.  The cards are neutral enough in theme that it's not going to put off anyone who prefers traditional card games.It also has quick set-up and plays pretty fast with 2-3 players.  This makes it a game we also pull out when we have time for just one more short game before bedtime or when we want to squeeze in a lighter game in a more hectic day.  We tend to prefer longer, more complex games when given a choice, but this is still one that ends up making the table at least a couple times a month - more if we have family members coming over for a game day.

Wonderfully interesting and challenging game for average teenager and/or adult.

  We really like this game. We tried the basic Splendor first and that became very popular in our family, then we added the Splendor Cities add-on package to heighten the complexity a little bit. If you can count and play cards you can play this game. Most of it is strategy and counting, no dice throwing (so none to get lost), the only chance is the order in which the cards turn up for each player to access on their turn. One game with 4 players takes about an hour and fifteen minutes although more can play. Strategy can include blocking other players' strategies. It was so popular we bought a set for our beach house too.

  We were introduced to this game over spring break 2016.  We took a trip with a couple other families and rented a cabin near the Smoky Mountains.  Between the 3 families we probably had over 30 games along.  We LOVE playing strategy games.  However this game quickly became the game of the week.  I think only a couple of the other games were opened up over the whole week.  When we got home I ordered this for our family and bought the app for my phone.  My 3 kids ages 8-13 enjoy this game as much as me.  I don't feel like I need to dumb-it down at all for them.  There's enough of a challenge to each game that makes you want to play it again and again.  With experienced players a round can be played in about 30 minutes.  It's a 2-4 person game.  I sort of wish you could play with more people but it would definitely add a different challenge as well as lengthen the game time.  Maybe a future expansion?  I love that you can play with 2 people and it doesn't seem to change your game strategy at all.  It's not one of those games that you say ""but it's more fun with more players.""  Having played the app quite a bit I can even see how one could come up with some solitaire options if they didn't have someone to play with.  We love this game so much I even gave a set as a wedding gift - nothing better than encouraging a new couple to spend time together having fun!

  While reading through the directions nearly scared off my early teen, it was actually refreshingly easy to pick up yet engaging enough that it's been played frequently since.

Sometimes Simple Is The Way To Go
","

  This is a seriously light game.  I cannot explain it, but I really love it.  Splendor is the most simplified version of an engine building game out there.  In the beginning, you can't afford anything.  While playing, you get more powerful and use the gems you bought to but more powerful gems.  There are some strategies that will win over others almost every time, but there is enough luck left in the game that any new player could potentially beat a seasoned player.  Anyway, not only is it fun, but it is fast.  If you know what you are doing, it can finish in less than 30 minutes, and very often, we decide to play again right away.  Now, this belongs in the ""Play with the family"" category.  I would not bring this with me to a board game night with my friends.  You might, and your friends might thank you for it, but for us, this game is a waaaay far on the simple side to spend game night on.Also, there is another game called Century: Spice Road which I think is a bit more fun and feels a lot like this game.  They are different enough to have both in your collection.

A fun Gateway game

  This is another good little Gateway game that will play in less than 45 minutes game with four players. It's good at all player counts and does what it's supposed to do. Thematically it's hopeless. You're gem dealers doing what gem dealers do and that's the end of the theme. I think that's the one sadly lacking component of the game and that you're doing stuff to be doing stuff to get points but it really doesn't matter what stuff you're doing to get stuff if you know what I mean. Aside from that quibble gameplay is simple and streamlined in that you can only take one of three actions on your turn and that really speeds things along. You may get stomped here and there until you adjust to the flow of the cards but once you do you should be roughly competitive in most of your games

  Splendor is a pretty simple resource based game. You can teach all the rules in about 5-10 minutes, and a round of play only takes 15-20 minutes. Also, the materials are very nice quality, and well packaged. The cards are a smooth, and nicely laminated, and the coins have the weight and evenness of real poker chips. Everything fits nice into the box. For more serious board gamers, I wouldn't recommend it, as there isn't a ton of replay value, since it's fundamentally the same game each round, but generally speaking, it's a fun, strategic game that doesn't require too much time commitment.

A Great Game!
","

  Splendor is one of the best games I've been introduced to in the last couple years.  It can play as slow or as fast as the players want, offers challenges for various skill levels, and is otherwise just plain enjoyable!  Other reviews have covered that well enough, so I'll just leave it with two little add-ons: I think that despite the age recommendation of 10+, a clever six-to-eight year old could handle the game well enough (or with a little help), and our games run closer to 45 minutes to an hour--but Dad and I are pretty competitive and like to really analyze our moves.My parents, who are in their 70s and for whom I originally purchased the game, weren't originally enthused about learning it.  After we got a few games in, though, they found that they enjoyed Splendor enough that they had me order another for them to give as a gift.  We now play Splendor a couple times a week whenever they are in town and they're now teaching my nephews how to play!I do have one minor complaint about the game though.  My parents have some vision issues, and it's sometimes difficult for them to distinguish between the colors on the cards from where they sit around the table.  The gem requirement graphics shown on the cards are oriented in different ways and do have different shapes, so that helps.  We keep the play area down by them, but sometimes they still have to ask about the requirements for a card or noble.All that being said, after Space Cowboys (the original publisher) was purchased by Asmodee there have been some quality issues (or at least changes).  The copy my parents ordered was SO MUCH LIGHTER than their copy that my father weighed it and compared it against theirs.  He then insisted on opening it beforehand to make sure everything was actually in the box (it was).  But the gemstone chips were only about 2/3 the weight of the other set.  That was only copy (1 out of 6) that was like that, but it at least partially lines up with what others have said.  Both those boxes were the same ""Golden Geek"" marked boxes,however, so that's not a guarantee of the quality of the components.  My most recent purchase all appear to be older stock, so those boxes are still out there.

  We tried out this game at Christmas with family and were hooked! We just had to buy it so we could better our skills and go back next Christmas and beat everyone. ;) I'm one who doesn't love learning new games if there are complicated directions, so I was a little concerned by this at first when the person explaining it took awhile and it sounded confusing. But once I started playing it, I got the hang of it right away. Our 8, 10 and 12 year old kids even love to play it. I only wish they made an expansion pack so our family of five can play together. We have figured out how to do it on our own though by adding a few red, black, white and blue poker chips to the stash. The only color of chips we don't have is green, so that has become the ""hot commodity"" and actually gives the game another challenge because the green runs out quicker, making you have to switch up your strategy. We have played this game with a few other couples since buying it and they have all loved it too. Once you play the first time, you want to play again - it's addicting.

  This is a nearly perfect board game. The components are high quality thick poker chips and the cards have impressive artwork. The rules are only two pages and the game can be explained to anyone in less than ten minutes. I have introduced this game to all different kinds of people and it is fast becoming a Saturday night staple. It has just the right mixture of length and complexity. The amazing thing is what happens to everyone around the table once the game gets going: All conversations come to a halt. Everyone stares intently at the cards plotting their next move. We have all played this game several times and everyone agrees that there is no one real strategy. A tactic that worked in one game will fail in the next game. This is a credit to the designer. The only real strategy is to get your ""engine building"" effect going as fast as possible and race everybody else to the end. Another nice benefit is the fact that this game plays as well with 2 players as it does with 3 or 4. But since nobody talks during this game, it doesn't really matter!

I'd say it depends on the child.We like that the game is different every time you play it, depending on the cards the come up and the way each person plays. Some people like to go for a lot of cards, some people focus on the point cards, some people on the nobles.

  We were looking for a game that would be fun for 2 people and wouldn't be too repetitive/get boring quickly. Splendor fits the bill, and every game is different due to the order of the cards and the royal cards selected. Note that for 2, we noticed that the game is more fun if you take out 5 cards per color in the brown deck (lowest deck with the most cards). Otherwise, you can finish a game without really needing many cards from the green/blue decks, and it makes it less interesting/strategic. Make sure you buy from a reputable seller (select your seller instead of using the default)... we received a game that was in perfect condition and had the sturdy, plastic poker-style chips!

The competition for gem cards is intense, so you'll find yourself taking cards even when you can't afford them, just to keep them from your opponent, especially when he needs it. Play balance shows that this game was well thought out and tested. What I like about this game is that there are so many different ways to win. Works great for any number of players 2 to 4. Quality components, especially the heavy gem chips.

Easy to learn, but a fun amount of strategy
","

  Splendor is a fairly quick game to learn, as you really only need to understand the options you have for taking chips and buying cards before you can get right into it. The strategy is pretty clear for anyone who has played an engine building game before, but anyone who isn't as experienced with board games will pick it up after one playthrough.The game itself has a good amount of strategy for how simple it is, as the order of cards and the different nobles changes each time. Over the course of the game you'll need to adapt to what your opponents are doing and which cards are coming up, changing your strategy based on the available options. There is also a mechanic that allows you to reserve one of the cards on the table, which is a great boost to the competitive element - though it sucks when someone takes the card you've been building to off the table!Splendor is a fun, fast-paced game that is pretty quick to pick up despite having a decent amount of strategy. It might not carry a board game night on its own, but it stays in the rotation for me as a short warm-up game or a cool-down after a bigger one.

Love this game versus the game that uses magnets in the pole and fish. Very sturdy
","

  I have had many different versions of this game from different companies but this is my favorite. All of my kids, ages 16, 12, 9 and now 2 have had this game and loved it. Somewhere between number 3 son and our daughter being born we lost or sent this game off to the thrift store.This version however is my favorite of all of them. All the other versions used magnets in the fish and in the fishing pole. In the previous games we owned the fishing pole was a piece of plastic with a magnet on the end.  This version the pole is a 3 pieces of plastic and the end looks like a shuttle cock from badminton that grabs onto the teeth of the fish.This game is easy enough that my 2 year old daughter doesn't get frustrated trying to play and I have found that even my 16, 12, and 9 year old children love to play it with her.You must purchase one c battery to make the game operate. I've had this game a few months and haven't changed the battery at all.This game comes with 2 yellow poles and 2 red poles.Also, the fish have had many a bath with our daughter and the fishing poles have come into the bath tub too. The eyes are still on the fish and the poles haven't broken.In my pictures I took a comparison picture of a pole from the travel version of this game. You can see the differences.I was pleasantly surprised with how sturdy this game is and I'd highly recommend it over the other name brand one's out there.I purchased this game at full price and am providing this review for informational purposes only.  Thank you!

Battery not included, but fun fun fun!

  ¬†My fault for not checking before I bought this but the battery is not included, so make sure you buy the battery too unless you already have a C type (not AA) battery at home.  I fortunately had extra batteries lying around or else we would have had a very disappointed child.  This game is classic and simple and so much fun for the entire family!  Its just as I remembered as a child.  The quality of the wheel and plastic pieces seem to be good quality.  The fishing poles are made of thin hard plastic with a sort of hook at the end and the fishes have teeth in their mouths where the hook attaches to the teeth.  My 5 year old kept wanting to play this again and again.  Then she started making up new rules to the game, like whoever gets all of one color wins.  So many possibilities and all fun! I'm so glad to have found this game.

Super fun and interactive game with toddlers AND grown ups and been using it for all family gatherings. The poles are a little flimsy and can see them expiring soonish.

This fishing game QUIT AFTER ONE USAGE !
","

  AM REVISING this review as I have had this fishing game less than a month, I brought it out once for my grandchildren to play, and now on the second time that we've gotten it out for them to play, it does not work. I'm hoping to see if Amazon OR seller will replace it, but until they do I cannot recommend it. And Amazon offers NO WAY to contact the seller, at all!  This fishing game takes just 1 C-size battery, and it's really a very sturdy, well-made game, heavier than I thought it would be, and especially for the price which was under $7.00.  It was also actually larger than I expected, with the round blue portion about 8"" in diameter, and the whole game board about 10"" long. It works perfectly, my two 4-yr-old grandkids had a great time playing with it. It came with 4 fishing poles, which is a good thing because that would be my only complaint because they are rather flimsy & I thoroughly expect one or two to be broken by little hands. So it's good that we have 4 of them, and even if the two portions of a pole become separated, it should still be possible to ""fish"" with it.  I'm glad I purchased it for my grandkids.

Go FISH!
","

  So first of all, I really enjoy that they included a ""go fish"" game with this, and I actually like playing the card game better than the actual game I bought. My 3yo has been LUSTING over this game, litterally talking about it every day since I bought it for him. He is way better at it than I am, which is why I gave it 4 stars. :/ It's HARD! The thing goes around pretty fast, faster than I expected it to go and way faster than I expected him to be able to catch the fish with. He's beat me... every time. My 6yo loves playing it with him, for 1 game - then loses interest. I keep the fish in a bag instead of putting them back in the box because i'm afriad of losing the peices. Good overall game, just wish it were a little slower with the rotation.

  I actually did not think this would hold up to use in my classroom, but it was cheap and thought it would be a fun for eye-hand coordination, colors, and counting for as long as it lasted. Months later and all parts are working and nothing is broken.It was hard for my preschoolers with special needs to use at first (and even me), but we learned to follow one fish until it opened instead of trying catch random ones and success.The fish are surprising durable and easy to snap back in place when the jaw gets unhinged which has happened when the children pull on it to open and close the mouth (not from normal use).We play until all are caught and name the colors and/or count how many were caught.

  My 3 year old absolutely loves this game! Batteries are included. You turn it on with a small switch and the little fish open and close their mouths and the entire ""pond"" (the blue part) slowly spins. The child has to use his fishing pole to catch a fish by lowering the line into the mouth while its open, wait for it to close, then pull him out. It comes with 4 poles. Whoever catches all the fish of a certain color first wins. Great game for hand eye coordination!

  This is the same good old classic Let's Go Fishing that has been around for a generation or two now, but with the added bonus of getting the Lucky Ducks card game for basically the same price as other retailers charge for just the Fishing game. The game itself is durable enough for some aggressive children to play, and is hours of fun even adults can enjoy. A great family game made a little better with Amazon's inclusion of a card game that is more suited for young children, but still a nice addition.

Cute, but not made well - can't complain for the cost I guess
","

  For the money spent and the fact it's made in China,  I guess I can't expect too much.  The screw base in the battery compartment which connects and keeps it closed immediately fell loose inside the base after I put the first battery in to test it out for my son. Well, rather than take the time to exchange the game, I took off the bottom, pulled out the little metal nut and plastic piece that covers it and was able to glue it back in. It worked and the battery compartment now stays closed when screwed together. Yay. However,  when I then turned on the game I realized one fish wasn't really working. Well, that fish is missing a tiny side piece so the jaw is not connected on one side. I bought this game after buying two other similar type games elsewhere, as those didn't work either and were returned. I purchased this as a replacement for a similar game we owned for years and stopped working. My son loves this type of game,  so I tried to find a decent replacement. Sigh.

Still fun

  I remember playing this game when I was a kid and decided to get it for my kiddos, 5 and 1 1/2 years. Though my youngest can't really play it, she still has fun with mommy's help. The game is simplistic in manner and only requires one C battery. When I received my set it had one fish that had a damaged mouth that wouldn't open, I was afraid I would have to return it, but luckily it popped back into place without any difficulty and works perfectly. While playing I also noticed, the piece that actually catches the fish can come off the fishing rod (usually in the fish's mouth)  if the child pulls the fish off the hook instead of opening the mouth to take out the rod. Without that piece then they can't 'fish,' so you just have to keep an eye out for that. Overall, a simple classic that is still fun and challenging to play.

Broke in ten minutes of rough play
","

  About ten minutes before it broke. Otherwise good construction, fish and poles were fine. Just weak motor. Two 4 year Olds were being taught how to play this. Supervised play, they had put their hand on the game about three times for a second to stop it so they could cheat. I was trying to teach them not to and it died. No one was touching it when it stopped but I'd assume that's what caused it. The price was so low I'm not worried about it, they will still play and even when the game goes the fish will still be toys. Changed the battery and it wasn't that.I think this would last a lot longer for an older child who knows how to respect and take good care of a toy.

Once we got the batteries, he loved it.  He plays independently and we play as a family.  For any adults that remember this game as a child...it's almost identical.  The only difference is the fishing pole.  These are all plastic with a pivot/hinge whereas the ones I had as a kid included a string with a hook.  The new design allows for younger kids to play, which is perfect.  Highly recommend.  Got this as an Add on item and saved a few extra bucks!

  Classic fishing game. We had this game years ago for my two girls and son who are now all older (12 , 15, and 17) So we decided to get it again for our new addition who is only 2 and she loves it! Up to 4 players at a time with two red poles and two yellow so if you like you can team play. This one is a little smaller than the first one we bought and not as sturdy(especially the fishing poles are flimsy) but the game play is still the same.

  Great game. My kids love playing it and it‚Äôs always a lot of fun when their friends come over.Beware that it takes a ‚ÄúC‚Äù size battery. Really? Are those even a thing anymore? I think the last thing I owned that used C size batteries was a remote control car from Radio Shack. Fortunately grandpa had some old ones sitting around that should last a while.My only complaint is that the rods are plastic with a hinge and a basket/hook at the end.

  Depending on the personality of your child, this game could either prove challenging...or frustrating.  You have to be VERY quick to get that pole in the fish's mouth before he clamps it shut.

  This review is for Let‚Äôs Go fishin‚Äô game. The game is fairly simple. 1-6 players hold a pole while the fish circle around on a track, opening and closing their mouths. The poles have a small ball on the end of the ‚Äúline‚Äù that they grab on to. The game is easy enough that my 4 year old niece is able to play independently. If a child were to pull the pole out too fast, the fish will fall back down on to the track, simulating a ‚Äúthat one got away‚Äù experience. On that note, even a small finger would produce the same result. In other words, the chance of injury is mostly non-existent. Fun game!Was this review helpful?

  This is one of my kids' favorite games - they pull it out almost every day to play with and it's been months since we first purchased it!  For that it gets 5 stars.We like:It's a great game for learning to focus and try to catch the fish.  They move up and down as they spin around so that's an extra challenge.  Kids LOVE it.All of the pieces are bright and colorful, it's really a cheerful game to play.It's simple enough for even young children to play with by themselves, or it can be fun for the entire family to play together.We don't like:The only thing I don't love about it (personally) is the fact that it's very loud when it spins around... and it doesn't play music like it says in the description.  The lack of music could be a defect in ours, I'm not sure.So overall I think it's worth buying and adding to your game collection - it's a popular game in our house!NOTE:  When I first received this through Amazon, one of the jaws on a fish was broken and several sticker eyes were missing from the fish.  HOWEVER, I emailed Pressman Toys customer service through their website and after I sent them the item number and date code on my box they quickly sent me an extra sheet of eye stickers and a replacement fish.

  Yes, this game is made extremely cheaply and if just a little more quality was built into it - it would be worth the extra money.  However, as it is, it is a playable game and quite fun for toddlers and the rest of the family as long as you don't expect too much from it.  Our three year old loved it for about a week - wanted to play it every day multiple times.The issue is that the component pieces are all made so cheaply that they don't function all that well.  Some of the fishes mouths don't open sufficiently for you to get your ""lure"" into the mouth to extract them from the ""pond"".  The worst quality issue was that the ""lure"" is actually a separate plastic piece connected to the fishing rod - but it doesn't fasten to the rod, but instead just sort of cheaply ""snaps"" onto the rod.  Of course, after playing just a short while - the lure becomes loose and just falls off the rod - making it impossible to catch fish any longer.  Explain that to a three year old.  :(  Sad child = unhappy parent.Still, some home fix-it steps makes the game playable, but I'd rather they charge an extra $6 or $10 and make the game a little better quality.  Even so, the game is fun - especially for young children.

  Got this for my 4yo nephew and 3yo niece. And they are loving it. I saw videos of them playing against their dad. And they are cheering for each other and winning him. Lol. My sister says he walks around whole day asking who could play. Told her she had to teach him to time himself.Great game. Exciting. I played one game with a colleague after installing the battery (before gift wrapping it) and she immediately bought one after the game. Immediately.

Great, albeit cheap, toy for all ages
","

  This is not the same quality as the one I grew up with- cheap plastic, stickers slapped on carelessly, BUT....  I still give it four stars for fun.  For $13, I don't expect it to be anything but junk.  I've read reviews where parents complain of the spinning to be too fast.  I think it all relative to age and coordination.  If anything, it teaches your child a level of patience and helps them work on coordination.  My 2 year old  is having a blast with this thing.  He took a bit to get used to the speed but once he caught on, you should have seen the look of pride when he caught his first fish.  Great game to have on hand especially when you are trapped in the house on snow days.  I bought this hoping it was a game that he could play with us, or entertain himself on his own.  I got exactly what I paid for, and I say this knowing that my rough toddler will absolutely break this within a year.

**REQUIRES C BATTERY**
","

  Very cute product and my three year old daughter loves it. I thought it would be too fast for her she would get frustrated but she just laughs when she missed an opportunity to catch a fishy.Perfect family game which is hard to find when you have a toddler. It is a bit noisy but for the price I can‚Äôt complain too much about that.It does require a C battery unlike most toys that require double A so be prepared for that.

I loved this toy growing up and when my daughter spent ...
","

  I loved this toy growing up and when my daughter spent her whole time at a friend's birthday party playing with this toy, I decided to buy it for her.  She is four and a little impatient but with time she will learn to play the game properly.  As other reviewers have mentioned, it is very noisy and sometimes find myself wishing she would choose another game to play.  It loses a star because it does seem cheaply made, however with proper care, it will hopefully last.  The fish have stickers for eyes and some have one eye missing.  Also, I remember there being holes in the base for the rods to stick into and this version does not.  It would be a nice option to have when the game is left out and you want to account for all the fishing poles.  There are four to be exact, two red and two yellow.  Amazon has a comparable price to B&M's as I price compared before purchasing.

  I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. I had a small version when I was a kid (with magnets) and I figured he was finally old enough. This one doesn't have magnets! I hesitated because I really wanted the XL version at Target. But this was plenty big for him to play with his brothers. It works well and comes out of the closet for a round of fishing about once a week. My 2 year old really loves it and it's great for his hand/eye coordination. I love that they can play alone or together. It's a must have classic.

  Some of the plastic fish heads are broken and will not open/close as the pond goes around. I put a brand new battery in the game and it only turns on and off intermittently.

Fun game but it's the cheapo non magnet version
","

  I ordered this after buying the five dollar version at Walmart.  The five dollar version wasn't too bad but it was flimsy and didn't have the magnets in the fish and on the poles so I thought I should upgrade a little to this version on Amazon.This version is basically the same thing as the five dollar version (no magnets and the poles are a stiff 'L' shape rather than the cheapo versions poles that were a movable 'L' ) except maybe the motor is a little better on this one from Amazon.I thought this might have the magnets because of some reviewers having mentioned the magnet but it does not.  It's just a bunch of flimsy fish that open and close their mouths.  The fish do move fast but my 2.5 year old is able to catch them.  It's a bit of a challenge at first but it's supposed to be otherwise there's really no point to the game.I should mention that my daughter loves this game so it's worth the money but I would still rather have a sturdier fish (the eye stickers come off and the mouths fall off pretty easy) and the flipping magnets in the fish and on the poles that apparently are impossible to find in this game.  I think the magnets made the game more enjoyable but then again if the kids don't know it could be better then to them it's a great game.I did save the fish & poles from the Walmart version and have been using them with this game. We now have back up fish for when the mouths completely fall apart.

Classic Fishing Game
","

  This is your classic fishin‚Äô game. Only difference from game when I grew up and this one is the fishing rods of this newest version are stiff plastic vs the string we had. No big deal. Newer version probably safer for kids. Highly recommend for entertaining kids. Our 3 years old loves it- helps with dexterity. And the 1 year old is entertained by the entire noise and motion of the game and tries to grab fish by hand. Recommend for all ages.

Good dexterity and hand-eye coordination game
","

  Got it for my 3 y/o who always wants to play it, but sometimes gets very frustrated - to the point she will grab the wheel to stop it spinning so she can catch a fish.  The inside fish are easier to catch and the outside fish spin too fast.  But she is starting to learn that she can just camp a spot where the fish always open their mouths and just wait, instead of trying to follow one around.  Even with all the abuse it's gotten, it's still working fine, so build quality to me seems excellent.

Excellent Use of Theme, Beautiful Artwork
","

  Gameplay - 9/10Theme - 10/10Artwork - 10/10Components - 10/10Overall - 10/10Don't be fooled by the beautiful artwork, or the adorable little illustrated animals hidden within the components, Photosynthesis is a vicious abstract strategy game, and it's probably the best use of thematic gameplay for any tabletop game in 2017, worthy of being equated with other top tier uses of theme in designing gameplay, such as Shadows Over Camelot, Blood Rage, and just about anything produced by Fantasy Flights.The theme revolves around growing trees. Not the sexiest idea for a board game theme, I know, but Photosynthesis compensates with its deceptively deep gameplay. You begin with two trees. Your trees absorb sunlight, which translates into ""light points,"" your in-game currency. You use your ""light points"" to disperse your seeds, plant more trees, and grow your existing trees, attempting to make your way to the center of the board, where the most fertile soil is located, which is where you'll accumulate the most victory points. Already I'm sure you can imagine involves a certain degree of area control and resource management, but the true depth in Photosynthesis' strategy comes from its timing and time management, which you have to plan every single one of your moves around. There's a ""sun"" rotating around the board. As the sun rotates, and strikes your trees from different angles, your trees cast shadows in different directions, which will cause the light source to be cut off from trees positioned in certain directions, including your own. Bigger trees cast bigger shadows, while they're also capable of absorbing light in the midst of the smaller trees around them, forcing you to constantly take into account where the sun is going to be positioned, and how you can best position yourself to absorb the most amount of light as possible, and, more importantly, how to cut off the light source of your opponents, which makes time management critical, and facilitates weaponizing the most cut throat strategies at your disposal. There is no ""nice"" way to play Photosynthesis, and still be successful.That all goes without mentioning just how wonderful the artwork and components in this game are. The trees at you and your opponent's disposal are not merely color swapped copies of one another, but each different color of tree comes with a completely different design, which is not only helpful for immediately differentiating between your trees and your opponent's trees, but it also just makes the game look that much more visually appealing when it's all laid out on the table, as you can see in the picture.I'm still deciding whether this is going to crack my top 25 board games of all time, since I've only played it four times so far, and I'll need to play it more to decide for certain, but as of right now, I'm betting it will, and it's easily my favorite new game from what I've played in 2017 so far.

A Game About Growing Trees?? Yes and it works!
","

  I had the chance to get a copy of Photosynthesis and meet the designer for a few minutes at the Blue Orange booth at GenCon. Hjalmar Hach was incredibly nice and described the game as a ""gamer‚Äôs game"", probably not for my family with young kids.Things I liked:Beautiful Artwork ‚Äì It‚Äôs a game about trees! Yet, each of the four players have their own unique tress, making up a forest tableau in front of them. The tree components and the board look good, box cover is cool. The game just pops with bright colors, like a fall forest in Northern Michigan (my home state).Mechanics Fit the Theme ‚Äì You are collecting sun to grow trees, chop them down and score them. Clear as day. The sun goes around the board in a predictable pattern. Trees block sun from other trees. When explaining the game rules, things will ‚Äúmake sense‚Äù because people know how trees grow.Unique Spatial Engine Building ‚Äì The best part of the game is deciding where to plant your trees to gather sun from the six spots around the board. You‚Äôll want to look for straight paths to the sun, avoiding your neighbor‚Äôs trees. Ultimately, you are thinking about the next SIX spots the sun will be‚Ä¶That can take a lot to think about, making this game better for older kids/adults.Simple, yet Meaningful choices ‚Äì Each tree can do one grow action per turn. The iconography is clear, you pay sun points to purchase seeds and trees, you spend sun points to throw seeds and grow trees. There is one currency, sun. You want as much asMight not be for everyone:Aggressive Play Benefits ‚Äì The best moves are when you can block your opponent from getting sun, or block them from a key spot in the forest‚Ä¶while also greatly benefiting yourself. This could frustrate people who like more solitaire game experiences. You are fighting for light in this forest!No Luck ‚Äì You will win or lose based on how well you placed your trees, how efficiently used your resources to build an engine and score some trees, and how whether you got blocked a bunch. Generally, speaking we all cut down three trees. The winner cut down four trees to edge out a victory.Calculating Sun ‚Äì You‚Äôll get better, but calculating how much sun you got on a turn can be mistake prone in the beginning. A tall tree blocks three spaces behind it, a small tree one space. You‚Äôll get the hang of it and be producing 10 sun points by the third round.Other thoughts:The game works at all player counts. Two is sort of weird since you go as first player, then the next player goes‚Ä¶becomes first player and goes again. But, it works. Three is probably the sweet spot cause the board is TIGHT at four players blocking each other out.Overall:Photosynthesis is a beautiful game that will catch your eye if you were walking past a game. It‚Äôs unique theme fit the game perfectly, and helped make the rules explanation fairly easy. The mechanics are simple enough that you can pick up on things by three or four turns and not have any questions. The game benefits from well thought out aggressive play, luck is not a factor. You‚Äôll make some great moves, you‚Äôll likely get screwed over a couple times. And, you‚Äôll have a cool forest to look at when the game ends.

Brilliant, Abstract Euro-Game!
","

  Photosynthesis is a brilliant, abstract Euro-game! It also has outstanding production values and an utterly unique and original theme! It's only flaw (and it's a big one in my book, hence the loss of one star) is that it DOES NOT scale well in my experience. Photosynthesis is PERFECT at 3-players, ok at 2-players and too long at 4-players, IMO. Still, this game is highly recommended.

Sunshine and a beautiful game!
","

  ¬†Photosynthesis is a lovely abstract strategy game, it has beautiful art, thematic gameplay, a simple but deep strategy, and is overall a joy to play and place on the table. I found this game over a year ago at a gaming convention and from the very first was drawn in by the way it presented itself on the table. It is easily one of the most eye catching games in my collection - however it is also a family friendly strategic adventure that is easy and rewarding to bring to the table. I would highly recommend Photosynthesis to anyone in the board gaming community, I would easily recommend it as a stepping stone to those moving from other classic games like Azul, Catan, or even the dreaded monopoly.Best at 3+ playersAge range 10+Complexity 2.5 out of 5Average playtime 45-60Non-gamer friendly - Yes!The GoodComponents / art - From the images and videos attached to this post it is clear that Photosynthesis is one of the most beautiful games on the market currently. From an easily readable board and tiles to the obvious stand out, the trees, each unique and aesthetically thrilling as the forest begins to populate the board. This game is well made.The gameplay - Photosynthesis is an abstract strategy / economic / action point board game. The gameplay and flow revolves around collecting sun and then spending the sun resource to spread and grow trees until they are harvested (chopped down or returned to the forest floor). The gameplay is rewarding, has a clear strategy, and has a complexity and depth to it that rewards future playthroughs and lots of thought.Strategy - is clear and simple enough to begin playing quickly - while providing a depth that rewards thought and future games (or the advanced rules)Story - the theme, art, and gameplay all feed into a rich storytelling experience. You watch the sun flow around the board, shadows cast on smaller trees, seedlings drop and spread, sun enriching and growing a colorful quilt of species. This game lends itself well to the imagination (if, like me, you want to see a story while you play)Non-gamer friendly - this game is clear, well laid out, has one major resource system, 4 major action systems, and 2 environmental mechanics - it is easy to understand, quick to learn, and fun to jump into.The BadStrategy - this game does have a depth of strategy to it so one well read and experienced gamer could ruin the fun by playing to win despite the group's experience or ability.Resource management - this game is focused on collecting and spending a scarce resource (light) all of your actions and points collected will be based around this model of play. If you do not enjoy resource management heavy games this is not the game for you.Play time - this game can run long, with new players or advanced rules it would be fair to expect this game to run 60+I know the winner - because the game limits your actions to one per tile per round there comes a point in most games where you can do the math and see the winner down the road. You might try to make good moves and carry the game forward, but everyone can tell that uncle Joe has two trees left to harvest in the last round and ours will just be saplings. This results in the last for rounds of some games feeling very - anti-climatic.Logging theme? One big problem with the game is that the theme goes off a clif when you harvest a tree for points - it feels like you are chopping down a tree you just nurtured and watched grow. I know the theme is more about the tree growing old and returning to nature - but someone will make a comment - and the logging feeling comes through loud and clear.Two Player? This game is not as good with two players - 3-4 is where it shines.The Game You start as two small trees on the edge of the board with the ability to absorb sunlight, grow, spread seeds, and retire. The main gameplay of photosynthesis focuses on the collection and use of resources (sunlight) and is divided into two main phases.Collect Phase - Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants syntheses foods from the environment around (carbon dioxide, water, sunlight) - this phase in the game acts in a simplified but similar way. The sun (a cardboard border on the game) rotates around the end of the playing field and provides sunlight to the growing trees. The players then gain resources for any trees that are not in the shadows of other trees.Action Phase - During this growth phase the players use the sunlight resources they have gathered to take a variety of actions.Buying - you can purchase trees and seeds from you resource pool to your storage making them usable items in the game.Planting - You can plant a seed from your resource pool to the board spreading them based on the tree they are coming from (one space for a small tree, two for medium, three for large)Growing - Grow a tree or a seed to the next level. If you have a larger tree in your resource pool you can grow a seed, small, or medium tree allowing it to collect more light and spread seeds further.Collecting - Once a tree is large it‚Äôs life cycle ends and you gain points from returning to nature (removing it from the board) you then collect a scoring token from the space the tree was resting in.Flow - Players can do as many actions as they would like (have the resources for) but they can only do one action per space (per tree or seed). The sun rotates around the board and once it has circled three times 18 movements the game is over.Points - points are scored by retiring trees and then collecting sun that you have in storage at the end of the game (max 20) Final Thoughts - 3.5-4 out of 5Photosynthesis is a beautiful and rewarding game to bring to the table, it is visually captivating, easy to learn and play, accessible to new gamers and fairly quick. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes resource management games, enjoys the theme, and has a new or young gaming group. There are problems with the game however, at times the ending rounds can be predetermined and anticlimactic, the theme is not always enforced by the gameplay, and the game can become unbalanced if one member of the group has played or gamed the strategy. At the end of the pond however - Photosynthesis is a game worth picking up and if you have made it through this article you already know that!Thank for reading ~ Give me a Helpful mark if you enjoyed it! If you did please check out Quackalope on youtube, fb, instagram - so you can see the new work we are putting out!

Pretty straight forward game of medium length
","

  Pretty straight forward game of medium length. Players ‚Äúplant seeds‚Äù and ‚Äúgrow trees‚Äù in the hopes of cashing in the largest trees for point chips. All this while trying to avoid ‚Äúshadows‚Äù cast by other, larger trees as a tree caught in a shadow can‚Äôt produce the monetary unit (Sun Points if I recall correctly) you‚Äôll need to buy other seeds and trees. It‚Äôs a very unique concept and a board full of trees is always a sight. If people didn‚Äôt know what you were playing they would certainly ask, ha!I wouldn‚Äôt give the game 5 stars simply because their are better, more emmersive games out there (Terraforming Mars as an example). This one is incredibly easy to teach as you only have three actions to choose from; buy trees/seeds from your player board and add them to your supply, have an existing tree on the central board ‚Äúcast a seed‚Äù (from your supply) and upgrading an existing tree on the central board (with one from your supply).This game should appeal to a lot of people. You‚Äôre not really killing anybody or summoning demons or anything. The theme of growing trees might seem bland at first but it works very well for this game. I‚Äôm also a fan of killing people and summoning demons  in games so of growing trees can sell me then it can sell you!

Competive forestry, in a box
","

  So after sitting in my closet for 3 months waiting for my wife to pull this out as a father's day gift, I was finally able to play what I call ""Happy Little Tree Chess, inspired by Bob Ross.""  You need to understand going in, I grew up in a Redwood forest and to this day LOVE trees.  I am not exactly an objective observer, but rather a passionate gamer and forest lover.  So with that caveat, what's the consensus?Much like its titular chemical reaction, Photosynthesis is an complex, brilliant game.If I had to classify Photosynthesis, I would describe it as an action based, economy driven, area control game.  Photosynthesis is all about planting seeds, growing trees, having those trees topple down to give you points, and starting all over again, all while fighting for the limited sunlight of the forest.The rules of Photosynthesis are actually simple.  At its core, there is a organic component and a economy game mechanic.  First, the organic side of things follows a nice pattern.  Seeds are 1, trees are 1-2-3, then four to score.  To break down what that means:  To plant a seed, it always costs one light point.  Next, the trees follow a simple 1-2-3//S-M-L breakdown; light points earned, shadows cast, seed-spread range, and cost are all 1-2-3, based on tree size.  If you want to score, its 4 light points.Second, there is the economy game mechanic side of things.  For obviously mechanical purposes, you need to purchase trees and seeds off your board, place them into your ""available area,"" and THEN and only then can you use them in the organic process of planting and growing.  It's the only un-thematic thing of the whole game, but the necessity is obvious to balance the game against the first player simply running board.Each turn, these two core components are carried out via actions.  At the start of a turn, players collect light points from their trees.  This is affected by shadows, which move based on the sun's position (it moves each turn).  Players then use those points to take actions: grow, plant, harvest (organic), or purchase (economy).Because it's based on nature, I found the rules very easy to pick up; just do what a tree would do, and you'll be fine.  It's all relatively simple.Until your eight year old daughter throws a seed over your tree, blocks the sun two turns later, slows your plans down, then your realize you can slow HER down by growing a taller tree, only to have your wife harvest a tree and allow sunlight in where you didn't expect it, which lets the brat-child make a bigger tree ahead of you, and you have to write the whole plot of land off to focus on another part of the forest.Let me tell you, the strategy to this game is NOT simple.  This is area control at its finest.  Your choices at any particular area hurt your opponents, probably will hurt you, might help you if you didn't hurt yourself too badly, and affect other areas as well.  It's brilliant.  The potential to harm yourself is especially brilliant.That said, there is an obvious mechanic problem with Photosynthesis that needs to be addressed.  This is abstract strategy at its finest, which means of course that you will have analysis paralysis at its slowest.  [Example: I just spent 5 minutes contemplating how the payoff from reaching the middle space may be mitigated entirely by the shadow effects that hit your own trees.]  In paralysis situations, I find that theme makes or breaks the game for a group.  For me, I can stare at trees and plot my forest (pun entirely intended).  You may not enjoy that nearly as much.  In fact, I doubt my wife will play this a ton with me because she likes high-interaction games.  Be forewarned!I don't want to end on a grumpy note, so before I sign off for this review, let me also say that the storage is atrocious.  The trees fit in the assigned areas, but not well.  You are stacking them, and they are so stinking pretty (see below) that I have concerns about that.  On top of that, the player boards and the game mat are smaller than their assigned area, so things constantly shake around in the box.  My solution: use another box.  Bottom line is that you can make it work, but you'll probably be happier with your own concoction.As a final note, the art to this game needs as much recognition as I can give it.  The coloring is phenomenal.  There are small birds and foxes on most of the trees.  The deciduous trees get the green, orange and yellow, with the conifer having a nice blue hue that rings of northern snows.  Each tree type has unique art for its seed.  Most importantly, all the trees are 3D.  This game is an absolute joy to look at.  I will try to bring this out as often as possible on cold wintery days.In Photosynthesis, the forest truly comes to life.  May the best forester win....

","

  This game uses its theme better than any I have seen so far.  Essentially an area control game where you are trying to grow your trees and then  'harvest' them to receive points.  Trees gather 'light' (this games currency) then use their light points to plant new trees or grow existing trees.  The sun rotates around the board with each turn and will hit the trees in different ways.  All trees cast shadows which will cover some existing trees and potentially cut off your 'light points' for that turn.  Great game!  Rule book is small and to the point.  Looks beautiful on the table.  Very light game that requires a surprising amount of strategy.Works well even as a two player game!

Amazing board game!
","

  I bought this game based on the reviews here and the whole family fell in love with it! Not only the graphics and design are visually amazing but it is a well-planned game, both for children and adults.  The rules are quite simple once you get used to them. I really don't understand why some people here found this complex. We actually got Monopoly along with it.  I had never played Monopoly before, but since it is such a popular game, I decided to try. Wow, how boring. If you find going around a board with a throw of dice to collect ""money"" is fun, you'll most likely find Photosynthesis too complex.  But if you wish for something more challenging, go for it. Photosynthesis is an awesome game that does not depend on luck, only tactic. You have to think ahead of the sun's revolution (well, really the earth's, but for simplicity, the sun moves, not the board) in order to optimize your production of energy, your tree growth and harvesting. The game can be played with simpler rules at first and then it can get more difficult (not necessarily more complex) by simply taking into account shade when deciding to grow trees. We are really impressed with how well this game was designed. It's really worth it if you like to spend family time and playing with friends.  I will definitely consider other games from this company.

The instructions are a bit lacking but the game play easily makes up for it!
","

  We just received Photosynthesis two days ago and have only played it once, with two players. We did play it using the adjusted rules for two individuals and it turned out very well.The game box came a bit tattered. Almost as if it was damaged during shipment. This is not a big deal to me though. Putting all the pieces together took a bit of time, with help that time could have been cut down a lot!The gaming instructions were a bit too simple. It does not describe what individual pieces are called, so I had to guess which was which. This also was not a big deal. Though when we started to play the game, I did feel like the simplified instructions left a lot to the imagination when dealing out light points or the multi step process of moving trees from the ‚Äòpersonal board‚Äô to the community board.Once we played a few turns, I was pretty hooked! I originally thought that the art was the highlight of the game, but was quickly distracted by the intense game play! There is a lot of thought and strategy that can go into this game. It almost feels like a colorful game of chess. The actual gameplay is simple after you understand the rules. It also is a fast paced game that ends before you realize it. With four players, the game would of course take a bit longer to end, by once everyone gets in a groove, it moves quickly.

  I like this game. It's dripping with theme with a decent amount of strategy. But, light enough that you can teach your parents or anybody else that hasn't played something like this before.However, the biggest downfall of the game is replayability in my opinion. Strategy seemed repetitive, but slightly varies based on different players. There is much more material then game that is in this box.

One of the new wave of more sophisticated ""adult-friendly"" board games?
","

  So this is definitely one of those ""enthusiast"" board games.  Complex instructions, fairly nuanced gameplay without outcomes largely due to strategy.It's attractive, colorful and handsome to look at, and reasonably fun to play.That said, it's not one of my favorite games. Why? It's just plain less fun (to me) than competing games, even those oriented around biological systems like‚Äîfor example‚Äîthe board game called ""Evolution,"" which in my opinion is much more fun.Gameplay here is fairly strategically deep, that's not the problem. The thing is that despite the pretty colors, there's still just not much to look at‚Äîevery major piece in this game is is one of four types of identical trees. And while the play is strategy-driven in a fairly deep way, there's only one strategic dimension to play in‚Äîit's just not a multi-dimensional game. It's all about sunlight and plant growth, and there's one way to achieve that‚Äîget more light to your plants.That description gives you some sense of the reason why this isn't a five-star game to me. It's fairly amazing that anyone managed to create a game where the object is to grow plants by allocating sunlight to them and have the game be entertaining at all. So kudos to the creators for that!But at the end of the day, I think this game is most likely to appeal to a certain kind of Zen-minded, purist gameplayer who needs no backstory, a very simple goal, a very simple concept, and largely mathematical, abstract strategic possibilities within that narrow set of constraints. There is nuance and complexity and depth within those constraints‚Äîbut for me, the game loses something by being so simple and abstract.No backstory. No plot. No reason. Just give sunlight to your plants.The gameplay is meditative for that reason. It's not boisterous. It's not a party game to keep everyone breathless and laughing. It's a game to play in silence, and that inspires silence. If that's your cup of tea, it may be a five-star game for you.The other thing that deserves a mention, for people not familiar with this genre of games‚Äîthe game is 100% cardboard. Board, pieces, etc. There is no plastic and no metal here. So if you have pets or small children, it may not hold up if they get their hands on it. If you're not careful with the pieces, they'll degrade fast.Overall, a low four stars. Probably more for a certain type of player‚Äîbut that type of player just isn't me.

Incorrect manufacturing - pieces don't for together - update, great game!

  Well, I hope to update this review soon after I receive a set which can actually be put together. This is there second box I've received from Amazon, and it has the same issue as the first. The small trees are not cut properly! As shown in the diagram, the tree game pieces are supposed to have a cut in the top and bottom of each half of a put-together tree. However, the small trees, with the exception of blue, are all cut only along the bottom, making it impossible to assemble and stand up the small trees. Very frustrating.I'll update after emailing the companyUpdate:Should've written this update sooner, but in short I was the doofus who didn't see the pieces I thought were missing on a parts board that was hidden from view when I looked through the box. Everything's there, and the company's customer service was very helpful!My wife and I enjoy this game a lot. Although it's not our favorite boardgame, it's well balanced and fun to play. Plus the game pieces and boardgame design are unique.

Fun for a few games
","

  I play a lot of board games. I found this one to only be fun for people who really like board games. Casual players won't like this much. I played with some friends, 2 sets of parents and with my g/f alone.It's a strategic board game in which you compete for sunlight by growing your trees in the best locations.The gameplay is fairly simple and easy to pick up on. Anyone 12+ can figure the game out pretty easily.My main issue with the game is that each turn takes too long. Each turn can take up to 3 minutes or so to figure out what you're going to do. By the time you go around to each player, you're just sitting there for 5-10 minutes just doing nothing. Maybe planning out your turn.... I found my non gamer parents to be really bored, and my g/f's gamer parents to enjoy it only a little. My friends had fun for one game but didn't want to play again. The conversation during the game was pretty bland. Nothing to really talk about or do during your non turns.Overall, the game looks good and plays pretty well, but it can definitely be boring and have long turns that lead to some somewhat boring gameplay.

Vicious Plant Growth
","

  So, this is a game where you grow trees, right?The sun moves around the board, giving light and life to your particular species of tree.  But wait, if another tree is blocking the sun, you get no light, which means no life?Something that on the surface seems like it could be a peaceful, easy time can rapidly turn into a cuttthroat battle for supremacy of the board as those who get the chance to grow continue to grow, and those who don‚Äôt have to muddle along hoping for a breakComing from a family that takes their tabletop games very seriously, I can say that this was one of the more deceptively divisive games I‚Äôve ever played.  It‚Äôs hard to think in terms of ‚Äúcrushing my enemies before me‚Äù while looking at a forest of multi-colored trees, but true warriors can make weapons out of anything, even acorns.10/10 would recommend

Light-hearted adorable game for almost any age
","

  The game looks complex but it really isn't. Everything you can do is listed on a board in front of you. You grow and spread trees out to earn light points. The light points are used to prepare more trees or grow your existing trees. There are limited big trees for each person so once you grow your big trees you have to decide when is the best time to have those trees pass on to make room for new trees to grow (this is how you score what are basically ""victory points""). Person with the most points at the end wins. What's nice is the playing field is always shifting. What may have been a great spot to plant in the beginning may later be blocked in 3 directions by big opponent trees and what may have been a terrible spot in the beginning might become a prime spot after someone turns in one of their big tree.This game has a surprising amount of potential strategy complexity in spite of being such a simple game. I imagine kids 10+ would likely be able to understand and play this game, but it's a great game for adults too.

  My husband and I are both avid gamers / board and COD- We bought this to add to our board game room.Together we play games as 2 players like ;  pandemic, (regular) Lost cities , Legacy pandemic season 1 , Viticulture + Tuscany (Our favorite right now), Spirit Island, and Sushi -Go -Party amongst others of all weightsThis game weighs as a 2.27 -Lost cities weighs at a 1.5Legacy Pandemic weighs at a 2.83Viticulture alone weight at a 2.93 / with Tuscany it‚Äôs weighs at a 3.32Spirit Island weighs at a 3.97Sushi -Go -Party weighs at a 1.31So, we play all types and really enjoy them allThis game we‚Äôve played ten six-ish times, this is an abstract game meaning there is strategy required but it is abstract meaning it is every changing - not obvious - and this game uses an action point mechanism (means you get points and spend them to make an action )It‚Äôs a chicken or egg theory : Do I spend my points to plants seeds or harvest ? They‚Äôre both needed.It‚Äôs beautiful-Simply look at any photos on here or anywhere.Game turns are fast , it seems to be monotonous with only two people. It can leave you with the feeling of ‚Ä¢The ground hogs day movie‚Ä¢ or ‚Ä¢ As of your simply on a merry-go-round.I think this is a great game for children ( we raised ours with board games and I wish this was around back then)I am guessing there would be a larger dynamic with a large player group-We do take turns choosing any board game off our shelf that is opened (unsealed)  about four times a week and neither of us chose this one very often .We may be looking for a more taxing mental experience, but this will remain in the game room , with us as we do enjoy it as an option.Low mental impactHigh rate for friendly game playBeautiful artHigh quality constructionVery family friendly !Would recommend for anyone as a go to option for an enjoyable play.‚Ä¢ We just got the Everdell series and have not opened them nor played them yet- They will probably be next !

Cutthroat
","

  The game looks really cool.  The mechanic of the sun rotating around the board is unique and cool and is quite challenging to get used to.  This turned out to be a negative for me because it forces you to play with 2 or 3 future turns in mind, resulting in people taking forever to make their play.My least favorite aspect of the game is that the best strategy is to play cutthroat.  It may boil down to our preference for games, but we found that if you focus on building up your own trees that you will end up losing.  You need to focus on blocking opponents from getting sunlight.  This made it too combative for our taste.Also, some of the rules really don't make any sense with the theme.  A large tree completely blocking another large tree even though it is 3 whole spaces away?  Maybe I'm being too nitpicky but it contributed to combative gameplay.I also feel like it needs more randomness or variability.  It feels like chess but with only 1 kind of piece.If you like pretty games, then go for it.  If that's not so important to you, I would recommend a different game.

Growing trees is rather exciting
","

  When I bought this game, I did it for the beautiful artwork and how wholesome it was. I didn't know how others would react to it and surprisingly it went very well.  The hardest part of this game is the actual first time set up of putting the trees together, and also just remembering the rules. We got caught up a couple times remembering what who could do what and at what time. Luckily one of us memorized the rules and would tell us what it is.The game play is quite exciting and you really have to think about where to grow trees. It would be neat in future additions if they could add a light to the sun dial to actually show where the sun was hitting and where the shadows were overshadowing other trees.I think this game would be fun for a group of 4 but could easily be played with a group of 2 or 3. The game took us a long time because of the strategy we were playing out and the first initial set up, but otherwise it was a great time had by all.

Great strategy game, but storage after play leaves questions.
","

  Fun game with a lot of replay value. Great for families or pairs. Relatively easy to learn. Absolutely beautiful.My only concern is storage: the trees seem a little fragile when put together. Putting the trees together is time-consuming. So taking them apart to store them is not realistic, unless you want to spend 30 minutes in game prep for a 30-minute game. Putting them in the box, though, is an exercise in balance, patience, organization, and proper placement. (A game all its own?) The risk of damage while storing it‚Äîespecially if you store it sideways‚Äîis real.I don‚Äôt know how this would be resolved, but

BUY THIS GAME
","

  I want to start off by saying my husband and I have a collection of 100+ board games... I can not speak highly enough about this game! I bought it as an impulse buy for my husband for Christmas. I was a little nervous about whether it would be good or not. It turned out to be my favorite game of the year! It is such a simple game, yet there is so much strategy involved. My husband and I have played it through about 8 times now and the game goes differently every time because there are so many different strategies to use. We even will sometimes add a house rule for one game (like starting off with 10 light points).This game can be played with 2-4 players. I have found that it is an excellent 2-player game (which are hard to find), but it also fun with 3 or 4 players. The more players you have, the more competitive it gets.I love the look of this game and find it to be very beautiful. I am so glad I bought this! It is my new favorite game.

  I saw Photosynthesis on a top 10 games of 2020 list and thought it looked cool. At first when you open it be prepared to take 10-15 minutes to pop out all the trees and set them up. My wife and I played a couple of games and I really enjoyed it, she liked it but it's not really her jam. We went with some friends on a week long trip to escape Covid at a remote cabin. This is where the fun began. One of my friends was absolutely addicted and me and him played it a lot! I would say it's definitely more fun with 3-4 people. Also make sure and check out the advanced rules as they add a needed complexity to the game. It's easy to learn and easy to teach to people. It takes a few games to develop some strategy and I'm still coming up with new creative methods to keep my foes in darkness and harvest those tokens! It's really cool and I would highly recommend it for yourself or as a gift. The trees feel durable and the box design and the way you store them is such a simple elegant solution. Good job Blue Orange Games!

Simple concept but moderate complexity
","

  Simple theme but still very competitive and pretty easy to get the hang of the rule and moves pretty quickly. I have only played it 2 players so can‚Äôt say how well it scales yet. The only thing that is a little confusing to my wife and perhaps others is the concept of there is the space in front of you that is what is available and then the player board which is what you can purchase. It was very intuitive for my wife and she kept forgetting that rule. It would be nice if they put on the player board with some arrows or another simple box board for what you have available. Fun game for sure though. Also the first time takes a very long time because of the amount of time to carefully punch out and assemble the trees. The small trees didn‚Äôt want to stay together but a small dab of super glue fixed that. I really like the trees but wish that the base of the trees weren‚Äôt so skinny and fragile and easily bent because they just go into four wells in the box. Minor esthetics though and doesn‚Äôt effect game play.

Deserving of Praise

  Except for the game ending quite before I was ready, this was a pretty cool game.  You have to compete not only with the other tree species for sunlight, but your own growing forest.  It takes a little planning, and it's probably worth sacrificing some seeds or trees to cycle things through, with as short as the game was.  I played so that I never ""lost"" any pieces, but with a surplus at the end, I don't know that I needed them.

Fun Game! Almost Perfect
","

  This is a really fun and unique game to play. It's basically chess, but with trees. The artwork and the ever changing dynamics of the game make it interesting and fun to play. It's definitely a strategy game. Each player tries get the most points by growing and harvesting trees. Every turn the board changes as the sunlight moves and the trees grow into different stages.  It's fun to watch the Forrest grow and change overtime- it's almost like you're watching a miniature time lapse of a forest growing. The artwork is beautiful and really sells this game. Everyone that I have played with was initially skeptical being that its a game about trees, but after playing they all were really impressed.It's not perfect, however. If I could change anything it would be to allow each player have a 3rd tall tree. In the game you can only get two and this really slows things down and ruins a lot of the potential strategies in the game. On top of that, it takes two turns  of points to buy and place anything on the board which, coupled with the limited tall trees, really ruins a lot of potential. If they can update the version a bit to make gameplay a little more smooth than I'd give it 5 stars. But as of now, 4 Stars. Would I still recommend it? Yes. I would say you should play it at least once. Watch someone play it on Youtube before you decide to buy. But overall it is loads of fun and there is still a ton of strategy.

It's okay but could use tweaking to improve.
","

  I didn't like this as much as i expected to. I think the overall gameplay is decent, it plays fairly quick, but at least with 2 players it felt like the game needs adjusting. Example: the middle of the board gets the most points, but by controlling the outside where you first get sun, you can actually do better earning more 1x point tokens. It felt like it defeated the purpose of controlling the middle for more. Plus, the game time felt like it wasn't enough. After 3 turns it just stopped and it feels anti-climatic.  It is pretty fun other than those issues. It's replayability is okay, it is certainly more of a challenge and more fun with more people.

Received not 1 but 2 misprinted games. Misprint renders game unplayable.
","

  Can't play it because the small pieces are misprinted so that they can not be put together. To explain when you put the game together you punch both cardboard halves of each tree out of a sheet. There are large medium and small trees. The two halves are combined by aligning opposite halfs of each tree to make  a whole tree. Half A of a tree piece has a slot cut in the top, half B has a slot cut in the trunk, you slide half B over half A to complete a tree. Here is the problem All 4 different types of tree in the small size are half B type pieces so you can't put them together. I returned the first one I purchased as a Christmas present, and received a second with the exact same misprint. Don't waste your time as they obviously have huge quality control issues at Blue Orange or just didn't care and passed a bad deal from their manufacturers on to you the customer.

Highly strategic board game
","

  I did enjoy this game, although this requires the ability to think ahead several steps, similar to chess. I would not recommend this for young children. That being said, my husband and I enjoyed playing together, and there is a variation which would make it more difficult once you master the base version. My only complaint is that there is one ambiguity in the rules when it comes to seed placement. It specifies that you can place a seed x number of spaces away, but it doesnt say if they have to be in a straight line like the sun shines. That was what we assumed, but I think I am going to see if I can find clarification elsewhere. Oh, and while the pieces were sturdy for the most part, you still need to be careful when punching them out. My husband was not and one or two of the trees started peeling away from the cardboard as a result... men. *sigh*

  Just to start off, I wanna say that I received my box damaged on the side. I was really disappointed cuz I liked the smooth look of the box, only to find this damage on it to ruin it. I just wish I would've gotten a nice copy.That being said, I won't let that factor my thoughts on the actual game..The games is really chill, pretty fast moving, once you know how to play, and it has a good amount of strategy. Deciding where to plant trees and taking account where the sun will be in the next few rounds. Knowing when to harvest the trees for points is a tricky strategy too. Do you harvest early and collect points for the game? Or do you let the tree sit there and collect sunlight points to get more things to do in your next turns? Really awesome buy. But if you're more into fast paced deep gaming, you could probably pass on this one.

  I purchased this game after playing it with a friend once. One play through is all it took to convince me this would be a worthwhile addition to my collection.If you've played Settlers of Catan, you'll be right at home. This game shares a lot of things in that it is an area-control and resource collection strategy game, but it is unique enough that it's worth picking up even if you already have a copy of Catan.The theme is definitely unique, the components are of decent quality, and the simplified resource/action point collection and usage, combined with the time limit, make this a fairly fast-paced game with good replay value (since the rounds go by pretty quick once everyone learns how to play).Overall, 5/5.

Outstanding Family Game!
","

  I would normally write an extensive review for something like this, but others have so eloquently done so already (like Paul Bulger with whom I agree).  I've been a gamer ever since I was in high school (almost 30 years ago).  I've definitely played my share of games!  I got my family into playing games, and we're always looking for the next fun, challenging game.  This fits the bill!All the art work is beautiful.  All the components are high quality and very well done.  All four sets of trees are different and colored beautifully!  You have Oak, Maple, Cedar/Evergreen, and one other deciduous tree with which I am not familiar.  All the colors are brilliant and spectacular.  My only quibble would be that a lot of the tree pieces do not fit together tightly (so they fall apart), but since this can be fixed with a very small dot of glue, I don't see it as a big concern (clarification: all the trees come in two pieces that you fit together perpendicularly so they will stand up).The theme is very fun and intriguing; growing your trees from seedlings to full grown large trees is enormous fun.  Strategically placing your trees to get the most growth and light points provides just the perfect element of strategy and tactics to the game.  The game is so intriguing, in fact, that my wife (who normally does not get involved in our gaming sessions) wanted to play the game over and over!For those of you who have not delved into the world of Euro-gaming, do not worry.  I would put the rules complexity at around Monopoly.  In fact, the rules are so easy to understand that our 7 year old daughter can play.  The only thing is the strategy is more complex, so she had a hard time understanding where to place trees and why she would place them in those locations.  Our 10 year old daughter had no issues with the strategy portion.  The game box says for ages 8+.  This is probably true if your 8 year old is especially sharp and observant, otherwise I would say 10+.Game time runs at around 45 - 70 minutes, but it seems to go very fast.  Once everyone understands the rules, you could probably complete a game in 30 minutes.  The game does allow you to extend the game one full ""day"" which adds another 15 minutes or so and changes the strategy a bit.You can play this game 2 player, but it does make it a bit too easy (too big of a play area with no interference from other players).  My wife and I played several 2 player games.  The game says to leave out the highest point (4-leaf) rewards -which only come from the middle of the board.  Since you cannot reap the benefit of that space of the board, we decided to add a full grown, large tree (from a non-player color) to the center of the board (this affects light points and tree placement strategy).  We also added 3 small trees in three of the outside ring (1-leaf) corners.  Using the optional rule for tree growth along with these house rules made a VERY challenging 2-player game.Replayability is very good, but players do seem to settle into a set strategy once they know the game.  If you on the fence on whether or not to get this game, don't!  It is simply a stunning game with a very fun theme that will bring your family together for some fun moments!

It helps children learn about the basics of the whole photosynthesis process... which is needed in our world of screens and technology.  Most kids don't get to see farming up close and personal on an actual farm.

  We were looking for a good strategy game our 5 year old daughter could learn, but also contain elements of teaching and learning. Photosynthesis has all those elements and is super easy to learn. You can teach about the life cycle of a tree from a seed, how light affects the growth of a tree as well as develop strategy by blocking opponents tree's from receiving light. Good solid construction, clear instructions, in fact it took more time to do a first set-up than it did to learn the game.If you want something that plays reasonably fast (45 min. our first time through) and has good replay value, this is a can't miss game

The inner part of the forest has the best score point cards and your tree can absorb the most amount of sun (currency) theoretically... but you can also be blocked by a tremendous amount of turns by other people.... overall it is a location management game where you are trying to optimize your growth while cashing in your maxed out trees for points and starting over. Very very simple game and a unique one at that.Competitiveness 5/5Artwork and design 5/5Uniqueness 5/5

This is a beautiful and fun game
","

  Its art work and strategy are well done.  Some of the trees are a bit fragile and fall apart (especially the blue pine set), but they are easily put back together and not damaged, so that doesn't lose a star in my rating.  Perhaps it wouldn't be good even for older kids if they are rough on games, but my wife and I are careful and we love it.My wife and I first played the two-player game and enjoyed it so much that we had to play again simulating four persons (each of us taking two sets of trees).  That was much more satisfying, as it's fun to see all the different types of trees on the board at once.  There is also an option to take the sun around the board four times rather than three, and I recommend doing so, especially at the beginning, because it seems like there isn't enough ""time"" to grow very many trees to maturity in only three revolutions.The strategy aspect itself is moderately challenging, and playing our four-player simulation helped me figure out a bit what strategy works best (growing your trees quickly seems more advantageous than planting too many trees early--sort of like a real life farm, you want a cycle).  Outside of selecting the player who goes first, there is no chance involved (such as dice or card draws), so the smarter competitor will probably almost always win, though cunning and a willingness to aggressively interfere with your opponent's plan will also help.  The more players you have, the more chaotic and unpredictable (i.e. fun) it will be.I consider this game worth the price, I'd definitely buy it again, and we don't splurge on high-quality games like this very often.If I had one recommendation to the creators, it would be to find a way to handicap a smarter player (especially if the game is played between adults and kids, or experienced players and novices).

Nice Strategy Game for the Family
","

  Bought this game for a family trip because of the ease of play and strategy element.  I also wanted a change of pace from the usual Dungeon Crawl games we usually play.  I won‚Äôt say that it was a huge hit, but some loved it, some just thought it was okay.  I - personally - liked it.  If you like simple strategy games Then take a look a this game.  Takes about 45-60 min to play with 4 people; About 30min with 2 people.  Check out the on-line videos for game play to see if you likeit.  It‚Äôs definitely

Great game!

  I love having a variety of board games.  This games is pretty awesome and unique!  It's a beautiful game and very easy to learn.  The rule book is helpful, but I find a quick youtube tutorial much more efficient.  The only mechanic that I don't like is that same size trees can shade same size trees.  Maybe this rule was created to simply play or to limit overcrowding of the board, but from a physics perspective, two trees that are the same height would not shade each other multiple spaces away.  Maybe only shade if a same height tree is directly behind but not two or three spaces away?  A house rule worth considering?  Other than that mechanic, we love the game!

Great strategy game wrapped in a beautiful theme!!
","

  There‚Äôs a surprising amount of strategy packed into this beautiful looking game! In Photosynthesis, you plant seeds, harvest light with photosynthesis, and grow trees through their life cycle. Your trees earn light points through photosynthesis depending on how big they are and whether they are shadowed or not. You then spend light points to upgrade trees.  There‚Äôs an interesting game mechanic that keeps the sun moving to 6 position around the board, meaning that how ‚Äúwell‚Äù your trees are positioned for scoring is constantly changing. Luckily, the theme doesn‚Äôt overshadow or interfere with the pure strategy of the game design. There seems to be a lot of possible deep strategy in this one that we haven‚Äôt started to tap into yet, but game play is simple enough to get started and enjoy playing the first time. I wouldn‚Äôt be worried about teaching this to a non-gamer because there aren‚Äôt that many actions or choices each time so it‚Äôs not overwhelming and feels very accessible. Despite the in-depth strategy possible, I still think it‚Äôs one that we‚Äôll be able to teach our 7 year old (who plays lots of light to mid-weight Eurogames) to play from a game play standpoint as the basic game play isn‚Äôt complicated. Overall, I would definitely recommend Photosynthesis and think it‚Äôll be getting a lot of game play around our house!

  This game was easy to learn and turned out to be pretty fun.  It is a good game for people who enjoy strategies. I think the premise  of tree growing might make people think its boring but this game is far from boring. The only downfall of this game is that it is only for up to 4 players and this game is fin enough to want to take to get togethers and share with a group. It's a great game.Pros:- easy to learn- fast paced- strategy based- beautiful artworkCons:- only up to 4 players

Beautiful and fun!
","

  This game is easy to learn and has a wonderful aesthetic appeal! I have only played it a few times with my girlfriend, but both enjoyed it and will pay it again.The concept of the game is to plant trees, gather ""light points"" and grow your trees until you can retire them and collect game points. You get light points from the sun that rotates around the board. But beware that as your tree grows it also casts a shadow, which means smaller trees around you don't gather light points this can be good for blocking your opponent, but can also block your own trees! So planting trees becomes rather strategic, additionally taller trees can drop seedlings (to plant new trees) further across the board.Overall, refreshing game and definitely one to add to the boardgame collection :)

  The game is beautiful, the pieces are very cool and easy to assemble- but could easily tear if you aren't careful enough taking them out of the stamped cards the first time.The game seems very simple, however the included instructions are tough to follow... ultimately I just gave up and watched a few videos on YouTube to get a feel of getting setup and how turns work.A how to setup and play video from the manufacturer would be the only real thing I wish this game had, or maybe a smartphone app companion.

  What an outstanding game.Its complexity is directly proportional to the strategies employed by the players so it would work for most groups.If I had any complaint, it would be moving the sun around the board - its cumbersome and it could have been accomplished differently..The canopy is (dare I say) beautiful to look at and watching it change is stressful and enchanting at the same time as you compete for the sunlight and forest floor.Worth it.

  This game is very fun. Easy to learn for any level of board game player, though kids too young might not grasp the strategy aspect. Quick enough game play for even casual gamer's to not get bored. Fun with the minimum number of players, too. The concept has been talked about in other reviews so I will spare you on that. My thoughts are: Try this game, it is fun for nearly anyone to enjoy. It is strategy though. No luck involved at all.Every move matters and how fast you cash in your trees! Tons of youtube videos on the game!

BEAUTIFUL Board Game; Great Attention Needed
","

  This is a beautiful game with various different colored trees to ""grow"". I often want to play this game over other games just because this game is so visually appealing and nature-positive. The game set up is thorough enough for game play, but you need to pay a lot of attention to every move and diligently keep track of ""energy"" earned/spent per round. A digital game would make energy usage easily calculated but would ruin the visual appeal. Additionally, the learning curve for this game is a bit higher than most-- it takes a little more time to learn than other simpler games, but it is worth the effort in the end!Overall, I think this is a brilliant new game and I hope this becomes the next Catan! The price has also dropped since I purchased this game, so its definitely a good choice for those seeking a new game experience!

  2-6 Players. 45/60mnsIn this game, you get to play one of the 6 Disney Villains: Prince John, Maleficent, Jafar, Ursula, Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook.A 10 year old that is used to board games can probably play without much assitance.The games were fun with 2, 3 and 4 players.We ( 2 adults, 2 teens) have played this multiple times and had a blast.We are Disney fans and we play a lot of board games.Each Villain comes with its own board, its Action Cards, its Fate Cards (which are often used against you) and its marker.Depending on the location of your marker, you get to perform actions. Each board is divided into 4 different areas which will give you different possible actions.. depending on the location of your marker, you get to perform specific actions.The main actions are:Play a card from your handGet a coin/coinsActivate a powerMove an item/Hero to adjacent locationPlay Fate cards on another VillainDiscard your cards.For instance, one location could allow you to : play a card, get two coins, discard your remaining cards, and Play Fate on another Villain. Another location could allow you to play TWO cards, get 1 coin, Activate a Special power, and play fate.You get to mess with other players by playing their Fate cards onto their boards.Each Villain has one goal: defeat Peter Pan, or Capture the Trident, or Spread curses etc...You start with a hand of 4 Action Cards, Some give you Actions to perform, or Ally to Help, or Items.  You start on Location 1,You place your marker on any other location, unless it is locked (cards can be required) depending on what you want to do.You perform at least one action from your location, but can also perform all if you wish.You add your allies and your items on YOUR side of the board, the lower side under each location. You get to choose where you place them. This can only help your Villain.However when other players play Fate Cards on your boards, they also pick a location and place the card on the upper side of your locations thus blocking some of your locations actions.You get to vanquish and fight to achieve your goal.The Disney Theme is cute. It is fun and witty and I am glad they gave special treatment to the artwork.However the game is deeper than it looks, this will take a good 40 minutes.Our first game play took a little over one hour including set up and reading the rules and giggling oohing and aahing at the cards.The game does not come shrink wrapped but taped on the edges. I have not dared to try and remove the tapes. It just looks like bad news.

Great idea, tedious play in its execution
","

  I am a huge Maleficent fan, so when this came out, buying it was a no-brainer.  I was so excited, and then so very disappointed.  I have only played this two person, but after several plays, the issues I have are not learning curve related and speak to the general execution of the game.  Basically, you are trying to reach your objective and stop the other player from reaching theirs.  What this amounts to is a never ending game, because every time you get close to winning the other player stops you.  Also, while they are taking their turn, you are sitting idly by waiting for your turn or something to happen that affects you.  It ends up being boring and a really long game.  They say it is 50 minutes of play, but the game we just finished was over 3 hours.  My husband basically was ready to let me win just to get it over with.  Maybe it would be better with 3 players.  Or maybe it goes faster with kids, but two adults who can think through the strategy continually thwart the other's efforts to win.  I would have given it one star, but it got a bonus star for having great art work.

YOU play as a Disney Villain and must complete your heinous schemes to attain your ultimate destiny!
","

  Overview‚ÄîYOU play as a Disney Villain and must complete your heinous schemes to attain your ultimate destiny!Disclaimer ‚Äì Skip to the end for the ‚ÄúFinal Thoughts‚Äù to get a snapshot version of this review2- 6 players, CompetitiveLength/Win Condition-This game plays super-fast (for a board game) at about an hour. This time will increase the more players you have but not by much honestly. I played through a few 3 player games and have tested out Ursula, Jafar and Maleficent and can say that turn length doesn‚Äôt take very long as you play from your character board and have just a few actions at your disposal each turn. To win you must complete the ultimate objective for your particular villain. Each of the 6 included villains has a completely different objective which gives the game tons of replayability. Seriously each one couldn‚Äôt be any more different and they are all super fun to play. Here is a short-ish rundown of each villains win objective to give you an idea how different they are:Prince John - Start your turn with 20 powerMaleficent - Start your turn with a curse card at each locationCaptain Hook ‚Äì Defeat Peter Pan at the Jolly RogerQueen of Hearts - Have a Wicket at each location and successfully take a shotJafar - Start your turn with the magic lamp at Sultans palace and Genie under your controlUrsula - You have to start your turn with the Trident and the Crown at Ursula's LairSo I super simplified these as it is much trickier to complete these objectives than it seems. For example it might seem kinda bland to play as Prince John as all you have to do is collect Power‚Ä¶..BUT there are a ton of Fate cards that can be played against you that actually steal his power. There is a nice balance woven into every villain so they can all be played and not one seems more lopsided than the other. Although I can attest that certain Villains *cough*  Jafar  *weez* are much more dependent on their card draws.Components ‚ÄìThey really did a nice job on this one. The game comes with 6 unique plastic tokens that are made up of a softer almost translucent colored plastic that matches your character. Each one looks different and is a really nice touch to the game to make it more thematic. The player boards have a nice velvety feel to them and are made up of a thicker cardboard. They fold in half so they fit in the box better but they really used this to further the theme of the game by adding a quote from that particular villain to one side.  The card stock itself isn‚Äôt the thickest but man these cards look nice. The cards are pretty slick so you might get an instance of cards sliding off the top of the stack. The colorful backs of each villain‚Äôs cards are glorious and the unique designs they incorporated are great. I also love the white color of the Fate decks as well and how they really contrast with the villains decks.  There are little cardboard tokens that are used for tracking power and these are pretty average, nothing special. The one thing component wise that is lacking out of everything is the cauldron that is used to hold the power tokens. A few pictures I have seen online of this it looks really cool, a thicker painted more epic looking holder. The one it comes with though is a flat gray VERY thin plastic holder. I mean it gets the job done and the game didn‚Äôt NEED to come with anything to hold all those power tokens so I appreciate it but as far as components go, it is pretty lacking.Box/Storage ‚ÄìThe box has that same velvety feel to it that the player boards have and it feels VERY premium. I love the colors on the box and the font they used as well as the gold foil inlays around the edge. However it seems they opted to place 4 round clear stickers on each edge to keep the box shut instead of the usual plastic wrap you find on board games. Now for me this wasn‚Äôt a huge problem as you can easily slice through these stickers and leave them affixed. However if you are a serious collector you will probably want to remove these and they leave a really messy sticky residue behind. Also be aware that when removing the sticker it will more than likely pull some of that fancy looking gold inlay away as well. There is a cardboard insert that separates the cards into 2 different piles and a space for all the other components and it seems to hold everything in place well for good storage.Visual Appeal ‚ÄìVisually this is one of the better looking ones and the writing on the cards is superb! With artwork directly from the Disney cartoons everything is extremely authentic and colorful. The theme from each of the cartoons just oozes forth when you play as each villain. Heck even their win objectives are thematic and interesting. One particular card that I discovered from Captain Hooks Fate deck really stood out to me with some incredible wordplay (I posted a picture of it with this review).Rulebook ‚ÄìFor the most part the rulebook gets the job done explaining the basic gameplay mechanics. Plus there are individual mini rulebooks for each villain that more closely explains each of their wind conditions and explaining in a bit more detail what they need to do. These are super handy as you can keep them close at hand at all times to reference and they take up very little table space. Also included are 6 reference cards that explain what each symbol means on the player boards. I would say it should take you no more than 20 minutes to really grasp how to play the game and maybe 5 more minutes to learn your character.Table Presence/Game Board ‚ÄìThis game takes up VERY little space on the table as you just have your individual game boards in front of you and space on each side for your villain deck and your fate deck. A little bit of space above and below your player board to place cards. In the middle of the table would sit the plastic cauldron with all the power tokens for everyone to reach, and that‚Äôs it! Now normally I would think a game with so little to bring to the table wouldn‚Äôt have great table presence but this game looks really cool, especially with more players. Each colorful player board has their villain specific player token standing atop it looking all awesome. Also the colorful backs of each different villain deck and the unique designs they each have are eye candy to the extreme.Table Talk/Fun Factor ‚ÄìThis game creates a bookoo of table talk as you are not only trying to achieve your evil schemes but are having to keep an eye out for the other villains to try and thwart their schemes. To do this you can choose to use the action to draw 2 cards from their fate deck and use one against them. The fate decks consist of those particular villains‚Äô heroes from the movies and other actions that will basically hinder their plans. It creates a clever dynamic and never makes it easy for the villain. And honestly I had a blast playing this. There is so much variety to each villain that each game plays a bit different but I am already looking forward to the (probable) expansion with new villains to play.Optimal Player Count ‚ÄìI have only played with 3 and had a ton of fun. I think a 2 player game would be a little too fast for my taste considering 3 players only lasts about an hour. I am really interested in playing a full 6 player game to see how that would play out as I think it would be really fun to get all 6 villains and their objectives on the table at the same time. The ultimate showdown. There isn‚Äôt a single player option however you can easily play 2 or more villains yourself to learn the game. Of course some of the villain cards drawn and some abilities are meant to be used with multiple playersFinal Thoughts ‚ÄìLove it. Absolutely love this one. From the color to the artwork to the clever writing on the cards. The majority of the components are nice and the box feels premium. The game is easily taught although I wouldn‚Äôt expect younger children to fully grasp some of the intricacies of some of the villains. As far as theme goes this game is ranked super high as it should be with Disney. The only negatives I can think of would be the questionable stickers they used to seal the box and the cheap plastic power token holder. As the game has this really premium feel those 2 things left me slightly puzzled. For the price this is a must buy.

Another Great Expansion
","

  These three villains each have very unique gameplay, with additional cardboard pieces not seen in any of the other sets. This makes for fun changes, though I do wonder if these new expansions are starting to become so complex and evolved that they are no longer fairly matched with the original characters.As you'll see in the detailed review below, each of the characters have multi-layered objectives (do this, so that you can do this, and then you can win). This is fun for us as experienced players, but it's not a fair match to pair these characters with early villains like Prince John (collect 20 power) or Maleficent (a curse at each location). That said, these expansion characters are great to use against some of the newer characters, and even some of the older challenging ones like Ursula.Details for frequent players:CRUELLA: She is definitely the most challenging of the three. Her objective is to capture puppy tokens, but she only has two allies, and these allies need to be activated in order to capture any of them. The problem is that the two activate spots on the board are on the top row, so they can both be covered by fate cards and really slow you down. Playing her against Hades (which we've found to be the most difficult villain so far) proved to be a fair, and very LONG, matchup.PETE: He's the one that changes up the gameplay more than any villain to date. Instead of completing one objective, he has to complete four mini-objectives that are placed at each location. Some of these are relatively easy; some can be very hard, especially if you're targeted by a fate action. His deck comes with TONS of allies, which is helpful for certain objectives, but it does make his deck full of repeat cards. He might be the most fun to play with of these three though, because he has lots of routes to victory.MOTHER GOTHEL: Her objective is the most straightforward‚Äîcollect ""trust"" (represented as power tokens from the supply) by playing cards at strategic times. Rapunzel is a permanent hero in her realm, constantly moving back and forth. If you've blocked your opponent's ability to play fate actions on you every turn, then Mother Gothel is pretty easy to win with. But if your opponent(s) can strike you with a fate action every turn, it's almost impossible to collect and keep the necessary ""trust."" Be warned.Overall, this game continues to be a favorite! Of the expansions, I'd rank them (1) Wicked to The Core, (2) Perfectly Wretched, (3) Evil Comes Prepared.Enjoy playing!

BUYER BEWARE - Not Suitable for Children
","

  ""Well, well...""I wanted to love this game, but I just can't. Very poor gameplay design really lets this game down. It has quality components (except for the cauldron), and a fantastic theme/setting, but the gameplay is slow and laborious.The game says that it takes 50 minutes to play - it lies (""OFF WITH THEIR HEADS"")!Every game I have played has taken in excess of two hours (with 3+ experienced board gamers for each game). This game doesn't have the complexity nor strategy to justify being a two hour game, and it's way too long for kids. Terraforming Mars is a two hour game, Villainous needs to be 30-45 mins tops - especially if it wants to promote itself as a game for ten+ year olds.I'm not sure what the developers were aiming for with this game. If they wanted to just cash in on Disney nostalgia and milk people for money then this game will do that (TAXES! Beautiful, lovely, TAXES!). If they wanted to create a fun experience where players get to sink their teeth into Disney villainy, then I don't believe that they've succeeded.BUYER BEWARE. ""Pour Unfortunate Souls, in pain... in need..."" can get better games than this!Colt Express, Dixit, Codenames Pictures, Hare and the Tortoise, and Azul are all around the same price as this and are much, much better games for adults and kids alike.

  I received this game yesterday and couldn't wait to play a game. I played a game with my wife, sister, and bro-in-law; we played as Cptn Hook, The Queen of Hearts, Prince John, and Milleficent. I agree that there is a definite learning curve, especially with the first game, but I don't feel like it is quite as steep as others have described, but we do regularly play fairly heavy games. We each felt like halfway thru the first game we had the gist of things.We each commented in the middle of the game how much we were enjoying the game, and when the game ended, the other three players would have won on the following turn, so it was definitely a close game.I have the feeling that this will be a winner at my house for quite some time. Easily 9/10, The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten is because I haven't seen Jafar or Ursula played yet. Will update this review as necessary.

  I love board games, particularly more adventurous and more adult ones, but getting my wife to play them with me is like pulling teeth. This one is very easy to learn but a challenge to master, which makes it accessible for those who are casual board gamers but enjoyable for the more ""hardcore"" enthusiast. Each playthrough is different depending on what characters each player chooses, the strategy they apply, and the random draw of the cards. Can't wait until they release expansions with new villians.

Good Disney Fun!
","

  I admittedly was drawn to this game because I love Disney, and who doesn't secretly root for the villains every now and then. But after playing this a few times, I can say that I really enjoy it! Each player chooses one of 6 villains from across the Disney spectrum, each with a unique card deck, win condition, realm board and strategy. However, there is a lot of balance to the game, where no character feels over powered or a ""sure-win"". I thought it was very cool that Ursula played completely different than Prince John, even though the components were the same.The art is gorgeous, I love how each villain has a unique win condition, and most games were very close. There is a bit of a learning curve with new players, and the second playthrough is always more enjoyable than the first. Also the component pieces of the game feel a little cheap, but the game is almost half the price of a traditional big real ease. If you love board games and Disney, this is a no brainer. But even if you are not a fan of Disney there is still a lot to enjoy. Highly recommend!

It all seems so complicated right now...
","

  Got this for Christmas as I LOVE anything to do with Disney Villains and had wanted this game series for awhile now. We attempted to play it on New Year's Eve, along with the first edition of the game. Needless to say, after a few drinks, the rules proved to present themselves as quite complicated. There is not the simple one sheet of rules for this game... there is indeed an entire booklet! Along with that, they even supply a video link for where you can watch and learn how to play. We toyed around with some of the playing cards and marveled at the overall presentation of the game pieces and layout. But, there was no way we were gonna be able to play in a small party atmosphere in which people were drinking and excited for the New Year.  So, that being said... yes, this can be a bit overwhelming at first. But, for anyone savvy with these sort of detailed games, there should be no problem. I have taken the time to thoroughly read the directions now, on my own, and have viewed the videos, so it really does not seem as complicated as we were making it out to be. Yet, I would still say that due to the complexity, that this is indeed a game better suited for an older age range. It definitely does not seem like something most younger children would grasp at all, too easily. I plan to have a game night, focused on this game, soon. Once we have some actual gameplay, I shall be able to update my review. It looks like a lot of fun! The cards and pieces are beautiful. This does make a perfect gift for any Disney Villains fan. I was excited to receive it and am still excited to get to actually play it soon!

  The game itself is great. I was highly disappointed in the shipping. They didn't put the game in a box. They simply slapped a shipping label to the outside of the game box and it got crushed while shipping. Whoever made the decision that that was an okay method of shipping should be let go as they weren't doing their job. ...

The TRUE review for adult-only game nights!
","

  I read a LOT of reviews on this game, and there seems to be two different camps; people either love it or find it incredibly difficult to learn.  This review will be from a group of 25-35 year old disney fanatic folks, some who tablet top game, some who board game, and some who do neither and are totally new to all concepts.  With that being said, I will agree that there is a learning curve. HOWEVER - I did not find it as difficult as so many reviews state. After one full go aronud, you will pick this game up no problem, as long as you really sit with the rules utilize the ability card. I do NOT recommend this game for anyone younger than high school age, as there is a lot of strategy that is needed to play this game to its fullest. With that being said, once you get a good idea of how the game works, it is a TON of fun!  You can definitely play this with just two people, but playing with 5 or 6 is just so much more fun! I am REALLY hoping they release expansions with more villains, because after having this game for just two weeks, we played it NONSTOP, almost every night, and we are all familiar with all the great strategies to win with each villain! Wonderforge, PLEASE RELEASE MORE VILLAINS!! Love this game so much!

I am a bit obsessed with this game. Highly recommend.
","

  I made my fiance play this 5 times in two days just so we could see how all of the characters work in game play. Each player chooses a villain and each villain has a different objective than the others. The goal of each player is to reach your villains objective before the other player reaches theirs.This took about 2 hours to learn properly. I say that, because this could easily become one of those ""monopoly type"" games where each household has their own rules, simply because they didn't feel like figuring out how to play as the game creators intended. If you get this, be sure to put in the time to figure out all of the rules and little details that make the game what it is. It will be worth it!After we learned how to play, each game takes 30 min- 1 hour depending on what character you choose to play as. Some are much more in depth than others, making it a bit harder.I would not recommend this for children under 12 unless you are ok with making up simpler rules for your household. The game also includes a link to a website that lets you vote on who the next villains available will be. hinting at expansion packs. I really really hope they come out with the expansions soon!

Easy to learn and play and good for the whole family
","

  We received this game this past Tuesday and have spent a couple evenings learning the game and playing with my family of 5 (youngest if 8 years old and understood the rules just fine).  The game was well packaged and the cards and game boards are beautiful.  The rules are easy to learn after a couple rounds, but the main thing to understand is that each villain has different goals for the game and you need to be aiming towards that while also watching that others are not close to winning.  We have had a great time playing through several of the villains and some of the fate cards that come up (cards that prevent a villain from doing things).  Overall, a fun card based turn game that is good for the family and it's about Disney villains, so what's not to love!

  This expansion is just more of what you want.If you're like me and you found the initial offering of villains to be underwhelming then you're going to want to pick up an expansion.This expansion contains maybe two of the more obscure villains in Dr Facielier and Hades but don't let that deter you, their decks are amazing, and they add a much-needed change of pace to the win conditions.The Evil Queen is more of the same in that she needs to draw a collection of specific cards and dispose of the hero but that's not terribly complicated so it's forgiven for being more of the same.Pick this up if you're a fan of Hercules especially as they really work the theme with that deck.

  My wife really wanted this so I surprised her with it. The game takes too long to actually figure out and there is too much going on to really keep interest in it. I found myself wishing someone would figure out how to win in order to end the game and be done with it. Somehow you have to care about what you are doing as well as everyone else when everyone seems to be playing a different game at the same time. My wife and sister spent hours watching YouTube videos to learn how to play it. I would suggest a different game for game night...

  The directions can be a bit confusing. For me I think that I just think too in depth for this game. It is vague on some things leaving unanswered questions on what you can and can't do, however, we settled on if the card doesn't say it then it is what it is. Stop asking all the extra questions. It was not as lengthy as I thought it would be. Our first go at the game I was Maleficent and my friend Ursula. We ended the game quicker than I would have thought, still not sure if we played completely correctly but I suppose we were close enough.All in all after not over thinking the directions we did enjoy the game. I will include my kids on the next go around to make things more interesting. I suppose the results of the game are as expected. It is nice quality as far as figures, boards, and cards go. I'd say it could be a little less pricey but being Disney you expect higher prices anyway. I give the game 4 stars despite the learning curves to the game.

Beautifully Made! But Too Much Like A Solo Game
","

  I ordered the 'Evil Comes Prepared' version with Scar, Ratigan, and Yzma. I wanted to play a few rounds of this game before I wrote a review, just so I could be sure that I understood all the rules before I gave my thoughts. I was SO excited to get this, and figured it would be a great way to pass the time during lockdown. While it is a beautifully crafted game, and the artwork and pieces are super pretty...I'm overall disappointed with it.I played with my roommate, and it felt like we were both stumbling through the rules for our individual characters and not actually playing a game together. Since each player is going on their own Villain quest, I really had no idea what was going on with her, nor she with me, since each character has so many quirks and special abilities/goals. We both felt like we were just using each turn to very slowly go through our decks to find the 'big item' we needed to actually move the game forward. I played my first game as Scar and my second as Ratigan, and both of them require you to find a certain card in one of your decks before you can actually make any real progress in the game.Once we actually did start truly playing, the winning felt a bit anticlimactic. You have limited ways to 'interact' with each other's characters through the fate decks, but¬†really it's either a major start-all-over moment or nothing, so it didn't feel very involved when one of us won. If just felt like luck of who drew their 'important' card faster.I'm a big board game fan, but I just overall wasn't not super impressed with this one. Again, it's beautifully made, which is why it still gets 3 stars! But just not something I feel the need to play again anytime soon. Glad I got this one before the big main boxed set.

For those already familiar with the original Villainous....
","

  I'm not good at explaining game dynamics or how to play, but for those of you already familiar with the original game (the largest set with Maleficent, Captain Hook, Prince John, Ursula, Queen of Hearts, and Jafar) this is definitely a fun and worthy addition!! (And yes, you can play with this pack alone--- it's just really fun to have more characters!) Hades is either my favorite or second favorite character in the whole series. I love this game because it's really well done (very thought out, detail-rich, true to characters), and because you're not just playing to beat other players. You're focusing on your own unique objective, and I very much enjoy that aspect. It is a strategy game for sure, so it can take a few tries to remember everything for a character while also making the most advantageous moves. I've only played against Dr. Facilier, but I got annoyed because I feel like he's hard to really ""harm"" in the game until he gets to the step just before he wins. His Fate cards are wimpy in my opinion. My husband loves playing him cause he kept winning! lol I did give it 4 out of 5 stars for ""Value for money"" only because the larger, original game is the same price if not cheaper! Still worth it, I just find that strange--- even the other expansion is almost $10 cheaper on here.

Introduction to asymmetry
","

  This was my very first board game when I decided to get into the hobby and it's mostly because of the theme. Disney villains are known to all ages and groups and go over well when you ask your friend group to play a game. Everyone starts picking who they enjoy, who they identify with, and start reading through their pamphlet.Some characters are more complicated than others and this is where multiple playthroughs are helpful. At first you're going to wonder how anyone at all can win this game as anyone besides Prince John who has the simple task of accruing wealth.Then after a couple of playthroughs with the same character things will start to click for you and your friends. You'll develop favorites and tactics for your main character.Something not usually important in asymmetrical games, at least I'm often told this, that what your opponent is doing doesn't matter and that is so far from the truth in this game. In two turns someone can be ready to complete their goal and understanding their goal could mean the difference when casting fate on their land in order to hinder their progress.All in all it's a fun game, easy to learn, and there are plenty of Youtube videos to help you out if you're unsure of how things work.

Good game, poor packaging
","

  UPDATE: The new, second printing has improved the box texture and added a nice, plastic insert to hold everything. Unfortunately, it's still sealed with tape instead of shrink wrap. Increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars for these fixes.I had to chance to play two sessions last night, and enjoyed the game. However, the packaging on the first printing is TERRIBLE. The game box has some odd ""soft touch"" finish which makes it difficult to open the lid and attracts dust and pet fur. The game also arrived damaged since Wonder Forge couldn't be bothered to shrink wrap the game, and Amazon's pictures didn't include any packing material in the shipping box.On top of that, the insert is also cheap, folded cardboard that was mangled, causing all of the pieces to slide around before I even opened the game. I am not happy with 1st edition.  On a positive note, the second printing removes the soft-touch material and includes a proper, shaped insert. That version has been out for 3 months now,. so I'm really surprised that Amazon is still pushing version 1.0.The game play itself is quite good, with simplified worker placement and an elegant, asymmetric set of abilities for each villain. So kudos for that, and the lovely artwork. But C- for packaging.

My New Favorite Board Game
","

  From the box to the cards (both sides), all the way down to the power tokens, this is just a BEAUTIFUL game. We play the base game and add the Wicked to the Core expansion.  Each character has a cool, special thing that makes them unique. My favorite Villainous character so far is Evil Queen from Snow White, who must combine ingredients into a poison to defeat her story's heroes. Ursula is tough, I'll say that much, but I think it's great that some characters offer more of a challenge than others. It's good brain exercise. This game is amazing and I'm looking forward to more expansion packs. Great game for grown-ups too!!

Awesome, fun, different game
","

  This game is so fun.  I gave it to one of my sons for his birthday and not only does he love it, but I'm hooked as well.  Everyone is a villain, you have a piece to move, power tokens, a board, a small info booklet, and 2 card decks - a helper deck (items, allies, effects) and a fate deck (the heroes).  Heroes in this case are not helpful.  Other plays put them on your board to thwart your efforts to win the game.Each villain has a different goal, as laid out on the boards and in the little info booklets.  Some villains are easier to win with (e.g., Prince John, Queen of Hearts) and others definitely more challenging (e.g., Maleficent, Ursula).There are rules and because the characters are all different and have unique ways of winning, it's not a 20 minute game to learn.  If you play with more people, the game will be longer.  DO expect it to take one or two times to get down the flow of the game.  It took 4 of us 2 hrs on each of 2 different days (4 hrs total) the first time...  Now the games are about 2 hrs.  When we played with just 3 of us, it was about 45 min.  btw, the games are different each time because of the villains being played, different strategies used to play the villains, and the shuffle of the decks.Younger kids will need more help; it's likely for 12 and up?  I think Disney fans will love it and those who like role playing games may enjoy it.  Also, if you want something other than a roll the dice and move game, it's definitely worth considering.  In this house, adults aren't playing just for the kids; we're playing because we enjoy it too.Obviously, I'm hooked.

Great game, full of rules but challenging good fun!
","

  My husband, teenage son and I are big Disney fans as well as big board game players. It‚Äôs a good thing we love the thinking and strategy games because Villainous is not a game that you can turn your brain off and play.It took a couple of rounds to play ‚Äúopen-handed‚Äù and figure out the rules. We really enjoy playing it and I see this game making it into the regular game rotation.The issues I had with it are minimal. I don‚Äôt think the average 10 year old would be able to catch on to all the rules I would suggest at least 12 or 13 years old unless your child catches on to game play and lots of rules easily. The other is that the cauldron that holds the power tokens is really very flimsy and I don‚Äôt see it lasting too long. I‚Äôll just use a soup bowl or something after it breaks I suppose.

Surprisingly Balanced
","

  I have played this game with a full group of friends down to one on one. It is very smart on how each villain are different yet can get close to achieving their goals at the same time. I have played different villains each time I have played and I don't feel like there is the ""one"" villain who is better and that everyone wants to pick because the win. It all depends on your strategy and how well you know your villain to play with their strengths. The fate cards are interesting, this helps you get back at your opponents and slow their progress. Also I really love the fate token, this is a genius idea, it prevents people ganging up on one person. Each time I have played this me and some of my other opponents will be close to completing their goals. This is a must recommended, especially for Disney fans. I look forward to the future villains that will come out.

Absolute fun, challenging and Zoom compatible!
","

  So in the days of social distancing, we've found that this is the ideal game to play over Zoom/Skype/House party.Every player gets a unique set of cards and tokens, unique rules per villain, and their own personal game board. Play many of the Disney villians with their own winning conditions, which mimic the events of the movie they came from.Except instead of failing, defeated by the heroes, the villians win. Vanquish heroes with powers, cards and abilities. Use your opponents progress to your own advantage, and mess with their games to trip them up.My family has been playing this over a Zoom connection for weeks during the pandemic, making it a great activity while keeping in touch with loved ones who you may not be able to visit. Every one has to have a copy of at least one of the games.Awesome bonus... You don't need the main game to play one of the expansions! All they do is add more Villains to play! Everyone does not need to have all the same expansions either.

Perfect for Disney Fans
","

  I bought this and the original game for one of my best friends and biggest Disney fans, and she loves it! I love the aesthetic of this game. The cards are unique to each villain‚Äôs movie and they are STUNNING! I was hoping the game pieces would be metal so I could display them, but alas, they‚Äôre plastic. But the design is so cool! Play time definitely takes longer than the box says, but my friend and I were never bored while playing! The rules are different for each villain, so you do have to ‚Äúre-learn‚Äù how to play the game each time you play, and sometimes it‚Äôs not incredibly intuitive (I referred to the guide A LOT). But the bonus to that there is high re-playability! Each combination of villains is a different game with a different strategy. A really fun game that caused me to scream ‚Äúpull the lever, Kronk!‚Äù in my local Starbucks a bit too loudly.

Fabulous Family Fun
","

  Gifted to our adult son. This was a fun game with all your favorite Disney Villains. What we found really cool was that each player has their own goals for the win according to the villain they choose. Individual storylines follow the Disney story for that villain. The art work on the cards and game boards is well done. Game instructions are well written but it will take a few times to learn all the moving parts to this game. There are also a few areas where rules do not fully advise how to handle a play... Example: Maleficent plays curses but nothing states she must be in the same area for the curse to be played, so can you play it like an item when an ally is in that area or does she need to be present? So this appears to be left up to house interpretation.  Regardless, Because each player is individualized, you can play this game often with various outcomes! Great family game! There are add on packs with different villains so you can have more than the original 6 players if you have a large group.

I love this game...but will you? A review by an owner of all expansions...
","

  This is a game with a lot of excellent design elements, but hampered by a few, particularly late-game, play issues.  I currently have the core Villainous game and the three expansions available at the point of writing this. I'll elaborate later, but in short, should you buy this? This game works BEST for intermediate to advanced level adult board gamers with an affection for Disney movies: classic to 90s. The age recommendation is 10 and over but unless you have a young player very engaged by problem solving and patient enough to withstand a lot of setbacks in the flow of the game, I would avoid it. What I will say is that it is an amazing implemantation of a Disney Villain theme into the mechanics of a board game, and it's just a beautiful looking game to have out. If you are a fan of these characters and not averse to some challenging gameplay, it's definitely worth a shot.Specifics: you play a villain! Here they are...Core game: Maleficent, Captain Hook, Prince John, Queen Of Hearts, Jafar, UrsulaEvil to the Core: Evil Queen (Snow White), Dr. Facelier (Princess & Frog), HadesEvil Comes Prepared: Scar, Ratigan (Great Mouse Det.), Yzma (Emporer's New Grv.)Perfectly Wretched: Cruella De Vil, Mother Gothel (Tangled), Pete (Steamboat Willie et al)MY favorites: Hades, Scar and Pete. All other villians are still fun, though Ursula and to a lesser extent Jafar I think suffer from comparatively poor play design.Everything is combinable; each expansion can be played without the core or other expansions.Objective: You are a villain and are competing against a number of other villians to realize your evil dreams before they do. Every villain has their own goal, their own allies and resources, and their own set of heroes the other villains will be playing against them.Components: There are a set of black power tokens that act as the game's currency of sorts, and 2-3 other pieces used universally. The core set comes with a plastic cauldron to put the power tokens in, but just a pile will do just fine. These pieces are serviceable but, unlike the villains' components themselves, nothing special. All the villains' components are completely unique and very high-quality. Each has their own fold-out board and two decks. The board and decks feature GREAT art pulled from the source material, given some painterly touches for more vibrant color. Each villain has their own player token, stylized figurines and very nice indeed. In terms of components, this is among the nicest games I've seen, particularly for licensed Disney.Gameplay: You and your opponents take turns. You move to different locations on your board giving you 2-4 different options; these options are sometimes limited by the heroes your opponent can choose to play against you. The turns are normally quite quick, though at the late game you might get some overthinkers. Each villain has a vastly different goal, and the pace of play varies greatly depending on how each one goes about winning.The Good: The implementation of theme into the gameplay is superb. Prince John collecting his taxes, constantly hampered by outlaws, Hades pushing his titans toward Mount Olympus, Scar setting his hyenas and killing lions on his way to the throne, Maleficent cursing the land as the fairies and forces of good try to stop her, the Evil Queen poisoning all those pesky dwarves! If you can get into the spirit of being one of these characters and especially if know your movie well, there is a whole lot of fun to be had here. The amazing art and design specificity make the immersion easy. It cannot be stressed enough how good the cards and the boards look; the art and color pallete really make each villain you play feel special.The Bad: The complaint I hear most often, and it is a valid one, is that your plans are too easily foiled. Opponents, if they sense you are about to win, will play your heroes more actively against you. One opponent hitting you is bad, 2-3 can bury you, and this back and forth can extend the game overlong to the point of frustration. Many times you will be set to win next turn and have victory snatched away. The way to beat this is to get good at the game: understand your specific winning conditions, have a bit of a poker face to avoid gang-ups and set yourself up with contingency plans. You're a villain, remember? Conversely know your opponent's villian and what tools work against them; it's very different for each one. But not every player is going to like to do this, so again, know what you are getting into. If you want to make the jump, Queen of Hearts, Hook, Prince John, Ratigan and all the Perfectly Wretched villains are much easier to play in this regard. Start with them and be aware the others are more challenging.Final thoughtsI really do like this game a lot. It's easy to learn, but surprisingly deep and hard to master. The core game is fun, but the expansion villains are uniformly better in design, which is expected with continued play I suppose. I wish it has some official solo variant, but you can always make one yourself. If you are a very casual gamer, or just looking for something quick to play with the kids, I would think twice (OR start with the Perfectly Wretched expansion and go from there-it's an easier set of villains and less $). If you are a serious fan of the films and the characters it's worth taking a chance on it. If you also happen to like midlevel board games and want a Disney addition to the collection this is a villainously perfect choice.

  We're all excited to play the game. The box was shipped to me on time but it was slightly damaged on the edge. It must have been on the bottom pile with some other boxes or was not very secure while transiting.Apart from some superficial dings and small scraps, the item itself is good. Wish it was wrapped in bubble wrap or something. That might help to prevent the damages. Because the box is really beautiful.

Lovely expansion or stand alone

  Ah villainous, what a game! There's no better way to start contention and a feeling of constant anxiety than to play a round of villainous. If you thought your spouse was your friend, you'll think again after they've ""fated"" you multiple times and made your path to victory near impossible. Why the 5 star review you ask? Because even though this game is frustrating, it is also one of the most clever and beautifully designed games I've ever played. Also, this is exactly how the villains in these stories must have felt; anxiety, and an overwhelming rage towards those who stand in their way! This expansion is lovely, and the mix of difficulty levels with the characters sets them up well to play with the other games, or on their own. You also can't beat the red and black aesthetic of the Cruella box, it's going to look killer on your shelf.

Too complex for non-gamers. Watch some videos first.
","

  I got this in another vain hope that I could get my family to play board games. My 4th grade daughter likes Disney, and my wife likes Malefecent, so I thought I might have a chance. But no. The thing you need to be aware of is, that this game, while not the most complex board game out there, isn't straight forward. Which would be alright, but the problem is multiplied by the fact that each player basically has their own rules and victory conditions. For a lot of game groups this would not present a problem. But if you're the one trying to get skeptical non-gamers to play, you're basically going to have to help each player understand their own non-obvious strategy. Which really doesn't work. I wish I could play this game, it looks great and seems like it would be fun, but I'll have to hope that I can find a group willing to play it that isn't my family.

  Really fun game to play. My sister and I had a blast pitting Captain Hook & Cruella DeVille (from the expansion) against each other. Seeing familiar scenes from the movies on the cards was a nice treat. The build quality and presentation of everything of top notch. Awesome present for any Disney fan.Couple of things to be aware of.1. The game does have a steep learning curve. I watched a couple of youtube videos on how to play the game in order to prepare myself before hand, in order to help my sister understand the game better. Theres a few details that go unanswered in the official instructions so I had to resort to the Villianous wiki for more information. Definitely not for young kids, since its heavily based on strategy and knowing your enemy‚Äôs game plan. I feel like kids would get bored/frustrated with this game.2. The 50 minute playtime is a lie lol. Just one game between first timers (my sister & I) took 2+ hours.Its a long game but fun all the way to the end. End game is especially exciting when everyone is nearing their main objective.

Nice Game- I just nitpick the box
","

  The game is very nice, a little complicated, so don't expect this to be a quick one to learn, but the replayability is very high, and so it is worth learning.  Nice amount of luck and strategy to keep younger players engaged.  Overall a nice game.The problem and the missing star is from the box :(  There are a lot of sperate pieces to this game, and the box does a pretty lousy job of keeping everything separate.  An increase in price to get a box that could fit everything in a way to allow for quick setup and a reduced chance of losing parts would be a very nice improvement.  That said, I was also sad to see that the box I had was slightly damaged. This situation is not typical with Amazon, so I would not downgrade the rating based on my bad luck, but it did not help me fall in love with the packaging.I still recommend the game, especially if you have a family that likes board games; this one is great fun for family game night.

  My son told me about this game he plays with a friend so I picked it up to play over the holidays. Some characters are easier to play than others, so it can depend on which character you have for the difficulty. Everything in the set is well made for one exception which is the cauldron where your tokens are kept, it's pretty flimsy so I'm looking for something to replace it. The games we have played with four players have taken around 90 minutes. For the reviewer that said it gets boring while others are taking their turns let me remind them this is with almost all games on the market. Nominally each character in the game usually only has four actions so it shouldn't take that long unless your just learning. Each character comes with a character guide explaining that characters special actions, there is a cheat sheet that on one side states all the characters end game objectives and on the other side what all the action symbols mean. The rulebook to me is easy to read and we found it answered our questions. One note of advice is pay attention to the punctuation on the cards, it can make a difference. Our family really likes this game five stars!

And I love that!Tge setup/strike IS SO EASY! I hate games that take 15 minutes to set up and only 20 to play. This game sets up easily, and they overall flow of the gameplay it's great.

  My husband, I, and our 12-year-old son played this game for the first time. We LOVE board games, but this was a new twist to some of our favorite parts of games we've previously played. You basically become a villain, trying to get away with whatever your villain plan is, and at the same time, you try to sabotage the other villains in play. Fair warning, it's a bit tricky to get the hang of. It took us all about 25 minutes of playing to fully understand how to plays work together and what our aim was. After that, I may have assumed I won, and then my husband had to be sure I didn't (because he never thinks I win... ever. LOL), and we realized I made an error. Youtube has a LOT of walk troughs, so it's pretty easy to find some info if you do find yourself stuck! This is going to be a family favorite for a long time!

  I bought this for my 7 yr old grandson.  He needed reminding to ask questions before just blurting out guesses (rules only allow 2 guesses) and losing your turn.  That's one of the great learning skills about the game; learning to consider facts and funnel down facts to get to the exact animal.  Interesting enough for adults, if not a bit simple.Set up for two players by an unimportant number of ""clue cards"" which we (3 players) just put aside.  We played several rounds with ""forgiveness"" to let 7 yr old adjust to rules.  Lots of fun just watching the ""wheels turn"" in his mind.  Perfect game for families, adult with child or child with child.  Am purchasing another to keep home for visiting children.

Political Garbage Mixed with Wrong Information
","

  My husband and I played this with our 15 year old and 11 year old. We had a good time at first until we started finding discrepancies in the cards. For example, the Iowa card lists it as a ‚Äúbig‚Äù state, but then puts North Dakota (which is 15,000 square feet LARGER than Iowa) as a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù state. We then were off put by the political things mentioned on the cards. As another person mentioned in their review, I understand noting one of our founding fathers or our first black president, but Joe Biden and Hilary Clinton! Seriously?! Ridiculous. After going through most of the cards we found the clues and information on the cards were often random and meaningless. Some cards were so blatantly obvious when others were ultra generic. I might‚Äôve been able to overcome my irritations about the size discrepancies and the random information, but adding in blatantly liberal political bias, no thanks. I will be returning this game.

First game my youngest has really taken to! He's OBSESSED
","

  My second youngest loves games so I'm always stocking up on new games. The youngest, just turned 5, likes games but loses interest quickly and can't participate in most of our games without help. For some reason he loves this game. He can't read yet but loves to use the card to get me to guess the animal. He describes the animal, tells me where they lives, what they eat etc. I'm hoping there's other versions of this game so I can get more subjects!

  This is a great game that's fun to play and unassumingly more difficult than expected. We've played it 5 times in the 2 days that we've owned it. They kids are enthralled. We have debated the accuracy of what's considered domesticated animals. You do have to be able to read in order to play or have teams where at least one person can read. It would also be great if there was an easy way to keep track of the number of questions asked rather than your memory.

  Very rarely do I give bad reviews, but this product really deserves it. I remember this Guess Who from my childhood and had lots of fun playing this with friends and family. But this version of the game is absolutely terrible.#1. When we received the product, one of the card holders was broken. I tried to fix it with some glue so i did not have to return it, but it still would not work.#2 None of the pieces in the row actually line up with each other (See picture).#3 the cardboard that the faces come on seems more like paper than actual cardboard (See Picture).  Two pieces had scratches on them already. You can tell that only the cheapest plastic possible was used to created this game. For the $25 price being charged on Amazon, you'd imagine it being a bit sturdier, but no, this is the type of plastic you can find in toys at the dollar store or Poundland.Also I thought that this game was made by Hasbro, but it is only licensed out by them to some company called Winning Moves Games.Please for the love of all that is good DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE to support a bad quality product for a formerly great game.

Do not Recommend; Colors are off leading to Frustrations
","

  I bought this for my daughter to work on her visual discrimination skills.  I was really disappointed to find that some of the colors on the cards that are drawn don't match the colors on the board images. For example, black appears as black on the board images and as brown on the cards.  As a result, my children unintentionally give incorrect answers leading to frustrating results. For example - one child asks ""Does your person have black hair?"" to which the other responds ""No"".  This inevitably leads to accusations later in the game - ""You said your person didn't have black hair!! You cheated!"".  When. in fact, no one cheated.  Net, the cards do not look as intended and I would not purchase this version of the game.

  I am a child of the 80's and so is my husband. Even though we were born in different countries, we both grew up playing this game. We both had the original Hasbro one, the version now called ""Retro"".We bought this for our 5 year old daughter and I was a little disappointed. This game is very cheaply made. The flaps are flimsy and they frequently hit the front row when you fold them down. The print quality is poor to the point it interferes with the game (the cards and the prints in the flaps don't quite match in color and generates some confusion...). The names are the same and the characters have similar features to the ones in the original version, but the illustrations are not as nice as in the original.The way you play the game is the same and it is nice and fun to play with the kids.

  The game itself is a classic win.  I found fault in the quality.  The pictures punch out, but for the kids, easy to tear when getting the game set up.  Also, the kids have a hard time determining which hair is orange versus yellow.  There are also only 2 eye colors... Blue and what looks like orange (weird).  Also, the back piece to the '?' to keep track of your wins was missing for one play board so it won't snap in place.Another issue is when you flip down a person, it flips down the person in front 30-50% of the time because they spaced them too close when they made the game.  I mean... Really?  That would have been so easy to avoid.It is fun once you know what colors each other is calling each color.... Before that you can never guess the right person.  The up side is even a 4-5 year old can play and not have to read... You just have to show them the person to guess or spell the name if they know letters.

... this for my 5 year old daughter because I loved it as a kid
","

  Bought this for my 5 year old daughter because I loved it as a kid.  In hindsight, I probably should have shelled out $20 for the retro version because of the little changes this one had that I don't like.A few notes:. The rows are very close together.  When my daughter goes to fold down a person/piece, the row in front of it goes down too. They actually hit the row in front of them as you fold them down.  At that point it becomes a domino effect.The hair colors are very difficult for a young person(and old) to differentiate.  The red hair kind of looks like brown, the black hair kind of looks dark brown, so when you ask the hair color question, it gets dicey.

A Time-Bound Classic

  I have memories of playing this game when I was younger. I might even go so far as to say that some, even most, are fond memories. The various faces with their hats, mustaches, and glasses are all back to challenge and entertain two people. Specifically two, because even buying two sets does not guarantee a 3 against 1 set up, unless, I suppose, you simply force people to ask questions of the person in a circle. Nonetheless, this game is fun and easy for kids. Most kids. My 5-year-old is an unabashed cheater at almost all games, including candy land. Seriously, hates losing a no-stakes game so much that given a few losses will stop playing--even if she won some as well. Sorry, a bit off topic. The game does not care if you rage quit, but if you toss or slam it all the little cards might come out. A classic game; I recommend it.

  Although it's just as fun as the classic I remember playing in elementary school, the construction is absolutely SHODDY.  I'm returning it and heading to EBay for a vintage one that's not much more expensive.  The plastic on this version could be snapped in two like a twig if you accidentally stepped on it.  The images are on cheap cardstock.  When you tap a picture to eliminate it, it frequently knocks over the picture in front of it -- really annoying when you're trying to teach a young child the game.The classic version was strong enough to stand up to class after class of 5th graders; this barely stands a chance in my house and it's only been a week.

  Fun game with easy set up. Teaches kids to ask detailed questions and listening skills.  The cards tend to fall out easily, but you just have to teach your kids not to play with the cards.  When I received this game, some of the pieces were missing. Amazon quickly resolved the issue.  Great customer service!

  It is 2019 and we still use weak plastic for kid's games. I figured petroleum engineering was more advanced than that, but I suspect it is more of an issue of contrived durability. I broke 2 of the picture frames when I loaded the face cards, so needless to say, we have to play very gently with Guess Who. It would be nice if the company would throw in 2 or 3 spares for these events.On the the plus side, kids have to learn to play gently and it is still fun and has been a great builder of my 4 year old's questioning, deductive reasoning, and elimination skills.

  We love this game! I ordered it before socialIsolation started. My girls 5 and 4 love playing with with me and with each other.

  Biggest complaint with this is that the colors don't match. The individual flash cards don't match the colors on the cards that go into the game. So when I ask, does he have brown hair?,  the picture I'm looking at on my game piece looks brown, but my opponents card looks like the hair is black. It has led to a lot of confusion at house. It's something that just looks like the printer wasn't running top notch when they printed all the cars. Regardless of why, it's dissapointing.

  Had this game from when I was a child *cough* about 30 years ago and my daughter was frustrated that there were only 5 females to choose from because naturally, she always wanted to pick the girl cards. I decided it was time to buy a new one expecting it to be more up to date. Wish I had kept my old version. The characters are almost identical, even the same names are used except for a couple that are swapped or hair color is different than before. There are less features to help identify the characters therefore limiting questions. The kicker? There are still only five females!

  like all things made today, this is cheaply made.  I don't mind that...as I have come to expect that. But the real issue is the graphics.

  I love the game Guess Who? and I was very excited to get it to play with a five-year-old. But this set is very poorly, cheaply made. The plastic pieces frequently pop out, and it is hard to flip down some of the faces without them hitting the other faces down too like dominoes, making the game very difficult and frustrating to play, especially with a young child.

Not really much fun for young children
","

  We love charades and thought this would be a fun game for our three grandchildren, ages 4 to 7. It's easy enough to play. Non-readers just look at the picture and act it out. Readers can use the word descriptions. It's just hard for any of the players to actually guess the right answer, especially if the actor is a young child. So my g'kids lost interest pretty quickly.  Even the smartest little kids can have trouble really acting out a word in such a way that the other players really know what they are doing. For example, ""backpack"" resulted in a 6 year old child just pointing to his back repeatedly. So there were a lot of wrong guesses, or no guesses!  Many of the clues tend to get acted out the same: a broom, a hoe, etc.On the plus side, it's fun that all players take a turn trying to guess the mystery word, until one person gets it right and wins that card. This is more fun and engaging than choosing teams and just watching while the other team take their turn playing. And kids do have fun when it's their turn to act out a word. We just found it got old quickly for the ones watching! I think we'll put this on the shelf and give it a try in another couple of years.

  The game comes with cards, a die and an egg timer. When it‚Äôs their turn, each player rolls the die and the number (1,2 or 3) displayed will determine which clue on the card they have to act out. The first one is always the easiest and the third is the hardest. You then have until the egg timer runs out to use gestures and sounds but no words to make others guess your clue. We usually forgoe the timer because it leads to frustration. We keep acting until the guessers all agree that they give up. It‚Äôs great fun for kids 4 and up but little ones have fun watching and being silly too.

  The game is charades, you act out the words and have the other people guess. I got this as it was on sale and I wanted to have something to do with my son during this pandemic.  The game got him excited for about one day and then it was back in the box.  He picked it up quite quick (5 year old).  But the card stock is really flimsy and a bit of a small bend and it will crease at which point it is easy to remember the items on the cards.  Unless this is on sale I would get something else for entertainment with the kids.

  ¬†Words cannot describe how terrible this product is. Hasbro's not even phoning it in at this point. They sent a vague sketch off to China, and instructions that ""it should kind of work, sometimes."" Even those low expectations were not met.  The board is not particularly straight, 2 or 3 of the hippos are warped 'up'; the necks extend but typically get stuck and do not retract. It's a complete and utter garbage product, and Hasbro should be ashamed of themselves.

Poor quality game
","

  I bought this for my 4 year old son because I remember playing this game as a child.  Unfortunately, they don't make things like they used to.  The quality of this toy is incredibly poor.The game itself is made of a cheap, thin plastic that easily bends when in use.  The Hippos necks get consistently stuck in the ""lunge"" position and you need to stop the game to fix at least one Hippo during each round. In addition, the cheap, plastic marbles get stuck in the Hippos necks so they stop ""eating"" the marbles during the game unless you reach in and try to pry the marbles loose.In order to set up the game you need to take each Hippo off of the bottom of the board and attach it to the top as everything is stored on the underside of the game.  The effort that it takes to set up and store this game properly means that my 4 year old can't play it without my help.  I can't imagine that the game will last much longer with any type of heavy use.

  Was so excited to get this to play with my son, and was thoroughly disappointed by what we received.The product is CHEAP and too light weight. The board moves all over when you play because it doesn't have enough weight to it. Even the marbles are light weight plastic and go flying if you hit the dispensing lever too hard. The inside of the hippos does not have enough slope to make the light weight marble roll all the way through the hippo, so they get stuck up in the neck of the hippo.You have to disassembled the game (remove all of the hippos) to fit it in the box provided which is SO impractical because my son will need to ask me to assemble it anytime he wants to play.I wish I could get my 1980's version of this game back. You are better off finding an old version of this on eBay or at a garage sale than than buying this cheesy imitation of what once was a great game.

You have to make sure they go all the back up, they don't spring fully on their own. If you don't do that it won't lift its head. The necks get jammed. The marbles get stuck.Furthermore, it comes deconstructed so once put together won't fit back in the box.

  As long as this game has been around you would think they would make a better investment into it. First, it has no storing box. The box it comes in you can't use to store it in. So it sits awkwardly on top of the rest of my games and sometimes falls over or gets in the way and then I am chasing balls all night. Also, the lever for munching should be more kid proof, it's small and off, not really good for a toddler. The board seems warped and so one hippo usually gets pretty lucky each feeding session. You can just tell they didn't put a lot of TLC into making it. They get stuck as well. The fun was short lived.

  Like others have said after playing a bit the necks get stuck and you can't play. My kids love the game, but don't want to play it now because ""it's broken, they get stuck"". It's to hard for a little one to get the neck back into place. I think when they tried making the packaging more consolidated this was the result. While stored the hippos necks are extended and locked into place to fit on the back of the game board. I hope they go back to the old version.

  I was EXTREMELY hesitant to buy this after reading even just a handful of reviews, but decided to take a chance since my 5 year-old has wanted this for years after playing it at a friend's. It all went together well, I was expecting it to be flimsier based on what I read, so was actually pleasantly surprised on its quality. We all played this for an entire evening and then the two kids- 5 and 8- kept playing with it for the rest of the weekend. And they were really rough on it, pounding on the hippos, launching the balls, etc. I finally had to put it away and while that process was more extensive than it should be, it all came apart just fine. I may be one of the few, but I'm really happy with it. Make sure you read the instructions, the necks lock intentionally for storage and if you overfill a ball reservoir you'll get one stuck up in the hippo's neck.

This game is flimsy.  The game board seems much smaller than I remember it.  The hippos are cheaply assembled.  When you really get going and start hammering on the lever, it gets caught up and the hippo's head gets stuck out in the middle of the game board.  The whole thing wobbles back and forth.  The marbles aren't even marbles.  They are plastic balls, and there aren't near as many as I remembered.  Although that is probably good because there isn't enough room to collect more than 10 or 12 at a time.It fills the void of not having the game, but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for a more substantial game.

  I bought this after seeing it and being hit by a wave of nostalgia, remembering the fun my sister and I had with this game 30 years ago. I wanted my kids to have an opportunity to create a similar fun memory.Back in the 80s/90s, from what I can recall, the game was one unit plus the balls. I dont recall any storage option for the balls, but it's possible that of there was one, it was just destroyed by older siblings before getting passed down to us. Now, each hippo detaches and can reclip to the bottom of the main game square for storage. The balls also have a storage lid that screws to the bottom of the unit. Frankly, as someone who had to problem solve backup options for lost game pieces multiple times, I rather like the change in storage.Oh...and yes...my kids love it!

Classic game; terrible box design.

  Classic game. Is basically impossible to put back in the box. I mean, you can, but it's a pain. You have to remove the hippos, arrange them in a pattern underneath the board, lock their necks in place, and place the marbles in shallow cup that loosely attaches. If you don't get it just right it won't fit in the box and the marbles may fall out. The marbles falling out wouldn't be such a big problem except that the box comes with a cutout where the hippo's mouth is on front of the box. Terrible design, especially if you want the kids to put away the toys themselves. The game itself is a classic and fun.

  Fun game. Kids have loved it, the hippos are already failing after playing it 3 times. The ""reset block"" on one of the hippos has deformed making it very hard to have it function normally.

  I loved this game as a kid so I got this for my kids. It is the same game I remember from when I was young.  I think I should have waited a few more years to get it for my kids. They are 4 and 6.  They love playing it but they have lost some of the balls that go with the game. Maybe that is typical for kids to do but thought if they were a bit older they would have an easier time with keeping it all together.

Cheap, cheap, cheap

  Terrible/cheap product design.  Game base does not sit flat on a table (marble compartment underneath sticks out, and makes the entire unit wobble).  Should also come with anti-skid rubber pieces, which I will be adding myself.  The hippo heads/necks lock up very frequently and gameplay is very frustrating, especially to small children.  The only way to get the game back into the box is by removing the hippo pieces, which will inevitably breaks the plastic tabs used to hold the hippos to the game board.

A subpar remake of an all time classic
","

  If you know the game from your childhood, obviously none of the mechanics have changed and it's just as fun to play now as it was then. My disappointment comes from where it seems everyone is a little disappointed: build quality. It'll definitely withstand light use, but I certainly don't remember it being such a low quality product all these years. The plastic is sharp and not easy to assemble for kids. Even for adults it's not the most intuitive design and is already showing signs that it won't last very long.

Game does not fit in the box once assembled.
","

  This was an extremely cheap version compared to the older game. The game does not come assembled so once you put the hippos in place, the game no longer fits in the box and it's not very easy to snap them on and off, especially for children. This means my 5 year old wants to toss the entire thing in the toy box, losing all of the pieces.This would be so much nicer if the box actually fit the game.

Poorly and cheaply made
","

  Got this for my grandsons to play with at my house because I had fond memories of this game.  They are 2 and 4.  While assembling this, which was not as easy as indicted on the instructions, two of the hippos almost broke while trying to get their heads unlocked.  This is so poorly and cheaply made that it barely lasted the first time we played it.  It is lopsided - and yes I assembled correctly, and the hippos barely stood up to a little two year old trying to play with it.  Am going to ask for my money back.

Very fun game, but poor quality
","

  Overall, this game was worth the buy. It is very cheaply made though, but it was cheap anyways so I don't feel like I lost any money on it. The main problem with it is that the ""Hippo"" sections don't fit well in their spots. It's made with a great design that comes a part easily and stores in a fun way. It even has a container that snaps on the bottom to keep the balls in. It would be much too hard for a small child (maybe even an 11 or 12 year old) to put together and put away.I even had trouble the first time putting it together.Snapping the hippos into place to play the game was very difficult, maybe it'll fit better with use, but I'm not sure.Also, when playing the game, the balls often get jammed in the hippos' throats and then instead of ""eating"" more balls, every time you lift up the mouth balls will come back out! It kind of adds a fun twist to the game, but gets annoying when trying to set-up again since you have to shake it to make the balls come out all the way.I gave it three stars because I wasn't expecting an AMAZING quality board game anyways. It was really ""Ehh"" but it is still a blast to play as long as you don't get mad when trying to put it together for the first time.

  This was a very fun game I used to play as a child. Now that my daughter is 5 I thought she would enjoy this game too!But i wouldve never bought it if i knew that it was so cheaply made. The hippos get jammed constantly making the game unfair and essentially useless. I don't understand how they made a game that doesn't even function properly!!

Lesser quality than the original
","

  I'll start this off by saying my two daughters (currently ages 2 and 4) love this game. The fun factor is the same as it ever was - for the most part. There are a few quality factors that affect the game's playability.- The ""marbles"" are now cheap plastic and don't give the same satisfying ""thunk"" the marbles gave from the version I grew up with. These light weight marbles are also prone to getting caught in the hippo's throat. Unfortunately, you need to take off the hippo to remove the offending marble.- Doesn't fit back into the box unless you want to take it apart and put it back together every time you use it (the hippos are detachable). This is a no go if your young children want to play the game on their own- Our version doesn't have a flat base, so it wobbles.- The hippos mouths sometimes get stuckI would have returned this if our daughters didn't love it so much. But honestly, after reading the reviews prior to purchase, I more or less expected the quality I received. I hate buying items that are poor quality, but my daughters have fun with it, and in the end, that is what matters.

Pretty good version
","

  It has been a few decades since I played Hungry Hippos last, but this version is a very close representation to what I remember.  The build quality is pretty good and I like how this version breaks down and stores easily back into the box.  The only thing I took a star off for was the ""marbles"" were more like plastic spheres vs real marbles.  This could be due to cost or safety, but it changes the play dynamics from my memory of the old days.

  I was really excited to get this game for my son, thinking it was going to be like the one I had when I was little. It's put together good enough but kinda cheaply. The hippos pop off if you're really into it and there is a dip in the middle so most of the marbles just sit there. For the price, I don't think its worth it when you can get pretty much the same thing at FiveBelow for $5

Two games have broken in the first use!
","

  This is the worst quality game we've ever purchased. The first time we played it the mechanisms on the hippos broke which rendered it useless as they get stuck. We contacted Hasbro and told them the problem and they were very nice and sent out a replacement, which made me happy. Upon opening and proceeding to play with it the first time, the mechanisms did the same thing and got stuck. Both products were from India and they must have a quality issue there. They just don't make things like they used to.

  My little sister had this game 40 years ago. It was so much fun back then. My wife and I purchased this for our Grand-Son for Christmas 2018. It's a little smaller than the original and the plastic is a little thinner but the Fun Factor never disappeared. He loves it. Simple to play but challenging for a little person to help teach them strategy in trying to catch/capture the yellow ball. It also helps with math when keeping score. Educational and fun.

  My first order the item was defective. Two of the hippos lever kept getting stuck due to a defect. You can see where the lever dips in. A replacement was sent thereafter. I saw two differences in slight color variation of the whole complete set and the workmanship. The defective one was made in India. And the replacement one was made in China. The China one was much better. The colors and levers all worked much better. So if you ordered yours and the hippos keep getting stuck, replace it and hopefully they ship you the one made in China. You can compare the difference and see for yourself.

  Simplified version of the older one. The newer rules (you don't build the trap as you go) make for a faster, more accessible game for youngsters but the actual trap isn't as neat as the older one. It actually fails to go off more than half the time unless you fiddle around with the cage and washtub setup. I'm also not entirely sure why they made the mice so gigantic, they barely fit under the trap! I might just make my own that resemble the classic game and will fit better. In short, I like the newer rules for my young son but wish I'd found an older version of the game that worked better!

  It took me a minute - and a YouTube video - to figure out why the ball was not completing the circuit, but once I got the last piece carefully and completely slotted into the cardboard, it worked like a charm and has been perfect ever since! Don't give up or rush through assembly - and use YouTube, Hasbro has a video about assembling this that is very helpful!  It's flimsier plastic than the old-school versions I remember as a kid, but it will work beautifully if you get things completely locked in place. We've played and assembled/disassembled it countless times already and it still works perfectly every time.

  I have been looking for the mouse trap game like the one I had as a kid. For the longest time they changed it to aim at younger kids. Finally brought back the original board yea!

  This was a replacement for an older version of the game sure to pieces in the old game breaking with use over time. There are some nice upgrades here.< Less pieces to put together, better flow, more ease of resetting for the next turn.< A catapult, how fun! Though maybe a little tedious to resetü§î, but the old hand was too.< No crank  to constantly fall apart< Only requires one metal ""ball"", not two< Only 1 die, vs 2 dice before< Less pieces of cheese than our older game< Slightly different game play/rules< Bigger mice/playing pieces/cheese slicesOverall I like this version better. My 4 year old grandson loves this game, both versions, though he is only interested in the mechanics of it, watching it all run, not playing the actual game.So,  one piece of advice.  If the catapult  throws the ball off to the side, instead of into the gutter to the tub, make sure all the pieces are actually fit into all the slots of the gameboard as intended. If  even one little corner is not, it'll probably throw the ball off.

  While my son (he is three) loves this game, I am not 100% happy with it.1st the instructions are terrible. If you buy this I recommend putting in the third section before the 2nd section. Following the instructions for this part will lead to explicit cursing and language.2nd the basket section does not ""sit"" in the holes so it rocks back and forth on top of game board. This means everytime my toddler moves his game piece on the board the trap triggers and falls down.3rd It is pretty cheaply made for the price. We paid $18. It was $25 in the store so we felt like we were getting a deal. It seems to be authentic to Hasbro, so we were highly disappointed in the quality for the price.Again, the toddler loves it!

The plastic used for this particular item is not very sturdy and doesn‚Äôt always stay in place on the board, requiring manipulation by a person to make the actual ‚Äútrap‚Äù aspect of the game appear to function.3. Again, with the storage problem, there are so many pieces and no organized way to store all of them.

  Heads up to all parents. This comes with sooooo many pieces it takes a while to put together and to take apart and store. That makes this game not so great because of how much time it takes to set up and clean up. The game however, once set up, is cute to play with the kiddos.

  Not sure how this made Mensa's list. You don't build anything cool, just the same way every time. I don't think there's a lot of replay value here. But the kids enjoy it, and they're the ones I bought it for, so I guess their opinions are important.

Mouse trap

  Classic mouse trap game. I wish the quality would improve a little over the years. The diver doesn‚Äôt always go in. The cage doesn‚Äôt always fall due to overall construction quality of the game. We make it work and my 4yr old has a lot of fun with it.

Missing Pieces

  Unfortunately I was very disappointed. We got this as a gift to our children for Christmas as they had been asking for this game for months. When opened up the game my husband and I noticed that the rubber band and the attachment to the ladder was missing. This made the game half as fun without a fully functioning trap. Hopefully this was a fluke situation but we were greatly disappointed.

  We really wanted to love it but the contraption is so cheaply made it just never works! the trap falls constantly, it never stays up and the rest of the trap works some of the time. really puts a damper not the game, we cringe whenever someone lands on the trap. needs a REDO! dont bother getting it, it is SO frustrating to play and so disappointing.

Would be nice if there was some sort of built-in containment for ...
","

  Purchased this for our 9 year old daughter for Christmas.  She loves the game.  The only complaint would be that once the ball goes through the course and drops it just flies off the board and there is no way to contain it without just trying to catch it quick.  This is worrisome for us because we have a 16-week old puppy in the house.  Would be nice if there was some sort of built-in containment for the ball once it drops.

  We were hoping this was the same game we played as kids.... back in the golden days of the 60's-70's.  The game rules and structure has changed.

  My son was excited but quickly lost interest because if anyone slightly moved the table or even lightly bumped something while moving their piece you would have to set it up all over again or when you would shoot the marble it would not be aligned with anything and the marble would knock stuff down.

Simple, Fun, Quick, Variety, Luck plays a role, Not Mindless and plays in under an hour!
","

  Simple to learn, Fun to play, Play is Quick, Lots of Variety (if you need it), a bit of Luck is involved yet it is Not Mindless! And it lasts less than an hour! Awesome!Many games which are simple, fun, have a good deal of luck involved and are quick to play are good, but many leave me feeling empty. I like to feel I have some control over my game, and am fine with a luck element as long as it is mitigated. If this describes your gaming style, you will love Quacks of Quedlinburg. I have played the games several times with different people and all have said they really liked the game.It won strategic game of the year but could have easily fit into the family game category instead (as intended by the company North Star Games). Kids around 10 could play and have fun, but a little more understanding of probability and they will probably do better. Either way they will enjoy the push your luck element and getting stuff.Quacks is a deckbuilding, push-your-luck game, where you draw tiles out of your bag each round, get surprise bonuses, and have ways to buy more tiles so you can do better the next round.Each player's starting space or ""drop"" begins the game at space zero. This starting space can permanently move forward later in the game with certain events. Having you starting space further along the track will allow you to get further and acquire more stuff, so it is kind of important.Each round begins with one player (starting player for that round) turning over the top card of the ""fortune teller"" deck which adds some simple change to the game this round.Starting in the second round, players that are behind the leader(s) may be given a temporary ‚Äúboost‚Äù to help them catch up based on the number of rat tails between their scoring token and the leader(s). This ‚Äúboost‚Äù moves up their starting position and acts as a catchup mechanism (if you were unlucky previously). It resets each round so you may have it one round, not the next and maybe even get a bigger boost later ‚Äì it just depends on the game situation each round. Then the core of the game starts.Players draw tiles simultaneously out of their own bags and try and advance their tokens the furthest along the track. The number on each tile indicates how many spaces ahead of your previously placed tile you place it on the track. Then another tile is drawn and placed that many spaces in front of the last. Tiles are of different colors (red, orange, green, blue, black, purple, yellow and white) and each may have an effect on the game depending on the chosen books being played that game. If the total on your drawn and played white tiles ever exceeds 7, you blow up your potion, but you still get to place the tile that blew you up. No other tiles count toward this total. The person(s) who advance furthest each round, without blowing up, get to roll a bonus die which gives a simple advantage.Next., players are rewarded for playing certain tiles on the board (black, green and purple). Following this, players who have advanced to a space rewarding a ruby are given that reward.Now the important stage - victory point advancement and purchasing. If your potion didn't blow up, you will get the victory points (object of the game is to have the most) AND ability to spend money on more tokens (which help you get more money and victory points) as indicated on your stopping space (technically it is the one in front of you). IF YOU BLEW UP, you only get to choose one: victory points OR spending money.After this has been done, players may spend rubies to reset their flask (explain below) or advance their starting space permanently by 1 for every 2 rubies spent. Then a new round begins (there are nine in a game).Extra notes: Each player has a flask which can be used to erase the last white tile drawn, as long as it didn‚Äôt cause you to blow up. Players turn over flask to show it was used, return the tile to the bag, and draw again. Once used, the flask must be refilled in the future during the end of the round.In some rounds, different colored tiles are added to the game for purchase, and in a later round each player adds an extra white tile to their bag. There is a different side to each board (which I haven‚Äôt played with yet) that gives players different options to get stuff rather than advance their tokens, and there are 4 different sets of rules (books) so each game can be fresh. Plus, the fortune teller deck is shuffled each game, so it leaves a little bit of unpredictability. Why do I mention this? Because this allows the game to be different each time, while keeping the mechanics the same (so you don‚Äôt need to learn anything new). That really helps with replayability.I know this game will get a lot of playing time for me and I hope it does for you. Each game lasts about 45-50 minutes, so it is a perfect length for a game (in my opinion).

Kind of torn about this. It's not really exciting.
","

  I watched a lot of reviews about this. I like the presentation. Besides the nit-pick about using cardboard ingredient pieces that will wear, it seems like a good game and that I'd love it.But I don't.The items you pick up CAN synergize, but are VERY random. Which leads to a lot of disappointment and you can get some bad rounds that are hard to catch up from. Unlike a deckbuilder, you don't go through the whole deck/bag. And you can't increase your draw to mitigate some of the randomness.In the end, it's so random that it fell a bit flat for us. We like to think and strategize a bit more.On the other hand, I think it would be a fun social game and fun in crowds.For us, this will go out in trade.

Fun theme, good replay value
","

  Easy to learn, fun to play. A sort of chip drafting game where you press your luck to try and get more points and money with a fun theme. There's a rat tail mechanic for the players that are behind in scoring, where they can start their next potion with a handicap to prevent one person from running away with the game, this is also helpful when teaching as it lets new players get a feel for the game without falling too far behind.The player boards are double sided with different options of play, while the ingredient books are double sided with sets of two that score or interact differently, and the fortune teller deck changes the rules of each round or gives a bonus to players. This gives a good variation of play and replay value.There is a fair amount of luck involved, but the ingredients you buy can help offset this. It's definitely on the light side, but it's very enjoyable. Everyone I've played with really liked it from more casual gamers to people that enjoy more heavy weight strategy oriented games.

Fast, Fun, and Complex while not being too much for the kid to handle
","

  Received this one on my birthday, so that was a cool bonus.  Really wasn't expecting it for another 10 days or so.It has been quite a long time since I bought a new board game, so bought this along with some others like those Tiny Epic games for me and my family to enjoy.To say the least everyone loves this game.  Myself, my wife and my 9 year old daughter.  At first it seemed a bit complicated but as the turns go along you get used to the flow of how everything works.  So it didn't take long, maybe 3 turns before everyone knew what was going on.The best part about the game is of course the potion making.  At first it is annoying as you have so many cherry bomb ingredients vs. other ingredients so you sometimes didn't do much of anything but as you go along in the victory points and buy new ingredients to use, you begin to be able to place many ingredients each round.So far we are only using Set 1 but it is pretty awesome and clever to have 4 different sets for most of the ingredients, changing the dynamics and strategy you can use for each placed ingredient or what ingredients to purchase.One thing I would love to see added is actual unique recipes.  Say for example you stop your pot with 3 whites, 2 oranges, 2 blues.  You can look up a unique potion and that finished potion has some sort of unique end of round effect like getting 4 rubies or allowing your next potion to keep the same ingredients out or you know, anything really.  Would be a cool thing.Anyway.  The game is fast paced and very fun.  Yelling and hollering ensues as your luck is bad one round while the next you get the furthest you've ever been this able to afford more ingredients for the next potion.Very fun.  Definitely buying the expansion and hopefully new expansions come out at some point.

  This is a great game and I highly recommend it to both light and serious gamers. Some of its pros- Everyone takes their turns at the same time which vastly speeds up the game, however the there is still plenty of interaction in other parts of the game.- There are 5 different variants of the game in one box, allowing for a lot of replayability.- This game could easily be 5 players without changing any of the mechanics, you would just need more pieces. I believe there is an expansion to the game allowing for 5 players, so you have to buy more stuff, but it is really hard to find good games for 5 players.

  Quacks of Quedlinburg is easy to learn, loads of fun and quick to play.  It is a perfect family game!  I would put the difficulty on par with games like TTR, Splendor or maybe Century Golem.  It is quick. With two players I don't think we ever went over 25 or 30 minutes per game.  It is nice that all players are filling their pots at the same time so you don't have to wait on others.The game mechanics are interesting and fun.  Though there is a big aspect of ""luck of the draw"" you can strategically make your ingredient purchases in ways that somewhat mitigate chance.We will be playing again this weekend.

  I love this game already! I saw it at PAX unplugged a couple years ago and have been interested in it ever since, but I only just finally bought it. The game play is laid out for easy comprehension and shouldn't take TOO long to play - there are only 9 rounds.  It's a bit balanced in luck and strategy if you build up your ingredients well at the beginning. We played the base game once and the alternate board once and both sides were fun (the alternate uses a second droplet that you can move up to test tubes of beneficial rewards - adding just a slight variation to the base).  I highly recommend this game and am very glad I got it!

Have fun playing!Decision making-  Quacks has lots of choices to make throughout the game-- when to take a risk, when to hold, what tokens to choose and what to give up if your pot explodes. If your child has trouble with making choices, this is a great opportunity to practice.  How to help: You might even want to help them by determining a strategy that will be used for each round--ie first 3 rounds, I will take risks, rounds 4-6 focus on purchases, rounds 7-9 focus on gaining victory points.  Having an explicit strategy (perhaps even written on a card) helps children focus on implementing a plan and builds confidence.Risk taking- This game is heavy on  risk and luck.  It is basically a game of press your luck with some strategy built in.  The good news is there are lots of built in elements that when things go wrong, llike your pot exploding, you still continue playing and there are ways to catch up so that no one lands too far behind. How to help: Talk about how taking a risk can help even when you lose.  In this game, letting your pot explode early on can help you get more purchase power and better tokens. Players who fall behind in victory points get more rat tails.  The game is well balanced.Social skills- One benefit of Quacks is that everyone plays at the same time, so there is minimal wait time (there can be some if players play faster or slower than others).  How to help: If the child needs to wait on a slower member, help them use that time to make upcoming decisions.  If a child is the slower member, let them work at their own pace or follow the risk taking suggestions above.Fine Motor skills- The game is played by pulling small tokens out of a bag which requires in hand manipulation and bilateral coordination due to the need to hold the bag with your alternate hand. These skills are great for improving handwriting skills.  How to help:  encourage children to hold their own bag and pull items out one at a time (this is the way the game is played).  If they have difficulty, you could insert a plastic cup in the bag to maintain the space.Math skills- Each person draws tokens and places them trying to stay at or below a total value of 7 which requires adding up what you have and deducting what tokens are left.  More tokens are purchased each round according to different prices and rules that require addition.  Older kids can learn to calculate odds by counting the pieces they have left and processing how many white tokens of specific value are left that might explode the pot. How to help: Younger kids could easily team up with someone who can help them do the more difficult math.  This is a great game to have partners.One final tip-  Quacks has tons of little pieces so we organize them in pill boxes.  They fit perfectly and can be color-coded.  It makes set up and clean up so much easier and also ads the skill of organization to the game.

Lively, Beautiful Deck-Builder with Strong Replay Variety
","

  Huge fun.  Great gambling mechanic that livens things up and reaches a less board-game-y audience.  Not for people who are easily bummed out by bad luck, as it comes from time-to-time, and does affect gameplay.  But the simple mechanics, variety of ways to advance and vary mechanics, balance of solo deck-building (bag-building?) and interplay between players, and fast play appeal to everyone I've played with.  This is the first game in a while that I just can't wait to play again.  And I already love the expansion‚Äîmore, more!

The rulebook isn‚Äôt consistent with names of things (‚Äúcherry bombs‚Äù = ‚Äúwhite tokens‚Äù?). Maybe it was translated poorly into English.

  The base game of Quacks has been, to date, one of our best board game investments, and remains a favourite among our growing collection. We have been anxiously awaiting this expansion since we knew of its existence!We were NOT disappointed.The function of the witches, and the new 'pages' in the book that add additional options for existing ingredients, really opens up the game. We love some of the new interactions between ingredients, that allow you to accelerate your progress, both around the VP track, and within your pot on each turn!Being able to buy chips to put in OTHER players' pots, that benefit YOU when they draw them, was a fun twist as well.The Witches have proven to be a game changer at opportune moments, especially when you forget they're there and then all of a sudden - BAM - they completely change the outcome of your turn!We will forever be indebted to Shut Up & Sit Down for turning us on to this (and MANY other) game(s).Happy stirring!

Misrepresented theme, critical of lifestyles not socialism
","

  Bought this thinking it would be a fun take on Monopoly game play. Returned immediately - you will to.  The game is more judgement of others' lifestyles than of socialism. It teaches intolerance of lifestyles which have no impact on your life. There are penalty cards for recycling, vegan style food (several), workplace injury, and yoga.  The creator of this version is greatly misinformed. Positive reviews on here are also not informed on what socialism is, and they should be ashamed to play this with children since it teaches intolerance of others' lifestyles which don't impact you - which their kids will take to heart throughout their life!  That's bad parenting to pass those attitudes along. This hurts the Hasbro brand for me and I am surprised they allow it to exist.

Offensive & Completely Misrepresents Socialism
","

  This game is not only offensive but completely misrepresents the tenants of modern socialism. All of the game mechanics and rules, from public health to tax-based programs, is absolutely incorrect and completely taps into false narratives that conservatives today love to spew on pundit forums, news outlets, and social media. Completely biased junk.Before you try playing this game, go do some reading to understand what socialism actually is/means and then do some further read to understand how current social programs in today's western societies (including the United States) use basic socialist elements to provide basic safety net needs of citizens (police and fire services, safe water resources, transportation, medicare, etc.).The bottom line: This game is *completely* offensive and represents the worst false narratives around basic socialist tenants and the programs that people in a modern society depend on.

  I love the level of anguish a board game has caused supporters of a failed ideology. Remember, during power brown and black outs, board games are all you can play. Can't wait to play the game of socialism without fear of starving to death, getting shot and placed in an umarked mass grave, or be apart of a social credit system. Negative one star because the company I bought this off of, using the superior capitalist system, chose a poor method of shipping, picture related. Game Box came crunched. For the cost, I would have hoped for better packing. Remember, if you lose, just say the magic phase ""this isn't true Socialism!"" and you win.

Bought it as a joke, but it is surprising fun to play. (Actual game review)
","

  FIrst off, I didn‚Äôt buy this from amazon so I won‚Äôt get the verified purchase label, but hopefully the picture provided is enough to prove I do own the game. I was lucky enough to find the last one on the shelves at a nearby store.And as the header suggests, I bought this as a joke. It‚Äôs been forever since I last played a game with friends but I assumed this was just a normal monopoly game with a parody reskin. I was surprised when I found out there were actually new rules to play with this edition. Which made the reason I bought the game even funnier now in hind sight. But as I looked over the rules and even did a few mock games with myself playing every player (With additional rules in place since the human element could be present if one person was playing a 2-4 player game) and I was fascinated to find out that the new rules for this edition of Monopoly were very fun.So at the beginning of the game, no players start out with any money and the board has a community fund ANY player can use. And there‚Äôs only a few way money can be put back into the Community Fund. So more so than not, that community fund will be lower than when it started for the entirety of the game. And if the community fund run out, everyone loses. Now each player has ten tokens they will need to put on to projects. First player to put all ten tokens one different projects wins. But first players need to buy the project, or auction it off to other player. Which will most likely draw from the community fund. Then with the edition of the chance card, when can be possible drawn during the players dice rolls, or on eight spaces spread across the board. And a good number of the chance cards will take from the community fund.So at the start of the it is about team work in a sense. All players have to work together to keep community from running out of money. But the end of the game is where I found it gets really interesting. Remember keep in mind I‚Äôve only done mock game with addition rules to compensate for a lack of human elements. But there have been several mock games I‚Äôve played, one player piece with have six properties owned and another player piece with have one or two. In any other monopoly game, the latter play would be destined to lose. But since the goal of Monopoly Socialism is to get rid of ten project token, that‚Äôs no longer the case. Each game, the player piece that would have seemed to be loosing, always seemed to make a come back and run neck in neck for willing. And it‚Äôs all base on the factors that there are limited way you can develop project, the chance cards can shake thing up when it comes to property or token management, and the fact that anyone can draw from the community fund.There are a few things in the rules that aren‚Äôt too clear but I tend to be a ‚Äúrules lawyer‚Äù at times so maybe I just looking too deep between the line, so I won‚Äôt mention when of them bother me so I don‚Äôt color anyone opinion. But if I were to issue one gripe, it would be this. If you notice, in the picture I provided, the stack of money has the five dollar bills on top. This game came with ten $1 dollar bills. And the only reason for that is in the rule booklet, the community fund starts the game with $1848 in it. The year the communist Manifesto was published. Which I get for the reference but for the entirety of the game, the one dollar bills aren‚Äôt used. Ever. No chance card, no pay out, no property; nothing else in this game needs the one dollar bills. So me personally, I tossed the one dollar bills away and chanced the rules that the community chest starts with $1850 in it, out of convenience.Other than that, that is my only gripe about the game until I play with friends of mine. The game length don‚Äôt take nearly as long as opposed to the original monopoly. 1 to 2 hours for my mock sessions.

  The chance cards in this reworked Monopoly game do a great job of poking fun at liberals. I'm a liberal and I can apparently take a joke. As I live near Berkeley, CA I can also say that many of these jokes have a ring of truth that reminds me of certain individuals, and that makes me smile. For those liberals who can withstand these tongue-in-cheek jokes, I think these chance cards are what makes the game the most fun. I also like collaborative games more than competitive ones, so I also appreciate this game turning the original friendship-ending nature of Monopoly on its head.Full stop. I'm surprised anyone would need to say this, but this is a toy. This is worth repeating slowly: this. is. a. toy. This is in no way designed to ""educate"" anyone about the follies of socialism. This game is as helpful at understanding socialism as Hot Wheels are at teaching children how to drive and repair cars. If you think this game is in any way instructive about socialism, it's fair to say you have a toy-level understanding of socio-politics. There is no meaningful short-hand way of saying this, but socialism, like capitalism, has pros and cons. And yes, there are dozens of comparatively ""more"" socialist countries than the U.S. that function just fine, and even better than the US in some scores. Socialism isn't inherently ruinous of societies - believe it or not, the U.S. has many successful socialist programs, which our country learned long ago (and the hard way) were overall beneficial to us, and it's objectively hard to disagree with some of these successes. Bottom line, there is no zero-sum ""socialism"" vs. ""capitalism"" divide - most politically socialist countries have thriving economies driven by modern-day forms of capitalism. Have some communist and socialist governments become corrupt or failed? Of course. But to take those examples out of context and with almost no understanding of those countries' histories or political backgrounds doesn't create a meaningful or well-rounded representation of socialism. The world simply isn't as simple as ""socialist bad, capitalist good,"" as much as that oversimplified viewpoint might politically resonate with some of us.Back to the Hot Wheels example, if you have a toy-level understanding of socialism, I'd strongly urge you not to attempt to ""educate"" others about this concept (incidentally, I'll note the ""ADULT"" rating of this game). If you want to talk to your children about your own political leanings, ideology, and dogmas, you have every right to do so. But it's not fair to anyone if you misinform others about how governments (including our own) work. There is nothing allegorical or symbolic about this Monopoly game that would truly or fairly help to explain socialism, capitalism, or vegans for that matter.That said, I find the way the makers of this game joke about liberal U.S. society to be very clever and fun. What this game truly shines at is creatively turning the rules of Monopoly on their head and making light-hearted fun of socialism and liberal politics and individuals. Please play responsibly!P.S. You'll probably lose. But at least you'll lose together!

Whatever Your Politics, It's a Fun Game

  But it's 2019 and everybody's got to be at each other's throat about an inexpensive board game. Ironic, this variation of the game is about group cooperation, yet the original was infamous for causing discord. Granted it was designed that way, yet people still bought it and in all kinds of different popular media versions.The irony alone convinced me to purchase this board game.But I digress, this Socialism variation provides a different goal and challenge along with it. Having a group fail condition subverts the expectation that one can easily become the victor in this game. There are methods presented to win, but everyone is tied to the Community Fund.This mechanic acts as a balance amongst the players. Even should you want to win, you inadvertently begin thinking of your neighbors who could end the game prematurely. Investing in projects and thinking together how to get the most out of the Bank is rewarding, literally!Still, the crux of this game are the ruthless Chance cards. These can take from your Community Fund or prevent further progress in project development. Conversely, they can also assist in community growth. Of all the components to this game, I would say the Chance cards are the weakest since they're so heavily used through the course of the game. A special die in this Socialism variation can cause you to pick up one or two Chance cards. Talk about overkill!My last remark would be that this game, much like the original Monopoly, is better with either three or four people. Playing with only two gets a tad stale as it's much easier to cooperate. Conversely, the game feels more punishing since not as many projects can be picked up as quickly.And I guess make sure anyone playing can take a joke about hot yoga.

  As Monopoly clones go this one has a different game twist.  Players need to work together to keep the government afloat, as they work on ""projects"" rather than buy properties.Gameplay is ok, and you need to forget many of your Monopoly strategies when playing it.  But still, it is a Monopoly clone, and not a Euro engine builder.As for the premise of making fun of socialism, I think it is dangerous.  Socialism is not just some ""kooky millennial idea"", its an ideology that murdered 100's of millions of people in the 20th century.  There is no scenario under which socialism can be viewed as anything but a road to totalitarianism and police presence on the order of the KGB or Gestapo.  Whenever the free market is restricted, black markets always arise-- a police state must always result to enforce the artificial economic system.  This game's lighthearted treatment of those horrors is  misplaced.

I got notification of its shipping and my joy was restored; only to be shattered when it arrived in a good looking box, but as if the game itself had been sat on. I wanted to contact amazon, but physically talking to someone at amazon is as easy as finding a snowman in a blizzard. And since amazon is out of stock with no pre-order offer, I won‚Äôt ever get a new game without paying filthy capitalist pricing. Makes me sad...

Pointless and exhausting
","

  The unpacking experience was very confusing exceeded only by the confusion of figuring out the rules.  This is a poorly thought out package and although it has gag gift potential, the game has little playable value.  This was a brilliant idea very poorly executed.  The quality of the components in the box are really cheap, the instructions are impossible to follow, and the printing is very hard to read.  Buy this as a gag gift at the lowest possible price since no one will really use it.

  Overall, setting my bias aside, I must say that the product is pretty good quality, but it's very misleading. If I had known this was a game made more for conservatives that hate socialism, I wouldn't have bothered wasting my money. This is a stupid game that people think explains socialism. All it explains is, ""You wasted your money on this game that doesn't last more than five minutes because it was made just to make socialism look bad."" Fun as a party game with a group of people who don't understand anything about socialism but swear it's the devil/ not so much fun for people who know anything about the topic.

Total junk, don't waste your money on this product
","

  Relative to the original Monopoly game I enjoyed playing as a child, this is a really cheaply made piece of junk, not worth half of what I paid for it; the tokens were indistinguishable, plastic blobs, and the game did not come with a complete set of dice but required the user to cut out and past tiny paper squares with the appropriate dots onto each face of a cheesy, plastic cube.  Bought this product with the intention of giving it as a present but was too embarrassed to do so and put it where it belongs, in the trash.

Great Game to Teach True Socialism and How It ALWAYS Fails!
","

  What a great game to teach the basic fault of Socialism.  As once said, socialism is GREAT until you run out of other peoples money!  No matter HOW many times you play this game, if anyone has any sense at all, you will AWLAYS loose, just like real life (unless there is a military to force socialism by slavery).Bottom line, you are spending everyone else's money.  It's a community fund, everyone starts with no money.  But how much of the community money do you want to spend versus letting the other players spend?  When you role the dice and land on a project, why would you not start it (buy it), because the funds come from the community fund, and if you don't spend the money, the other players will.You can literally end this game in 2 rolls of the dices.  First player roles and is inexperienced.  They land on a project and don't want it.  If they don't want to spend the community funds to buy it for say $100, then it must go to auction starting at $5.  The problem with this, and with socialism, if you bid, you just bid $5 of the community funds...well, I'm not going to let you get it for $5 from the community funds so I bid $10, from the community funds...and the bidding will continue until the community funds have been depleted because why stop bidding from the community funds and let another player get it from the community funds; thus, one of you will win the project for $1845 leaving $3 in the community funds.  On the next die roll, the player lands on Chance, which says the community fund must pay $50 to the bank...Now the community funds are out of money and the game ends, and everyone looses.This games QUICKLY teaches you that you better spend your share of the community funds before the other players do, or you let them win and you loose, because if you don't, they will!  Just like it works in real life!That fact is (and again proven in this game), many people have the misconception that Capitalism is based on greed; but that's not true.  Socialism is based on greed while marketed as a utopia for everyone, because everyone want's their share, and there is nothing like spending other people's money and getting your share of the community funds before anyone else does, and with no controls and a goal of winning or bettering your life, Socialism fails both in this game and in real life.

It's Ok
","

  I wanted to like this product more than I did. Making fun of socialism while pointing out why it's a failed philosophy sounds like a good idea, and it is. However, for me, this didn't deliver. I tried playing it with some family, and it ended up being over far too quickly. I have no problem with a game making a point, but when it comes at the expense of game play, there's an issue. It's possible we didn't do everything right, but we followed the instructions and with four people playing, ended up draining the ""community funds"" too quickly to be enjoyable. The game was over in a short amount of time and was actually frustrating because of it. We are looking at modifying it to make it last long enough to actually play.

Got to change your way of thinking
","

  In the beginning, we played it with a capitalist mindset (competition), and it seemed not to function.  But then we decided to play again trying to think like a socialist (getting the most money in the community chest as fast as possible) and trying to help each other develop projects.  LIke that, it was a lot a faster and made more sense.  We have only played those two times.  The game promo says the Chance cards can force you not follow your socialist ideals, but that is not true.  You never really have to play a vicious Chance card against another player if you don't want to (you can save it for later and then switch it for a better card when you get a chance).  Playing like a socialist requires a whole different way of thinking.  Hasbro thinks the game will be funny as your capitalist mindset clashes with the dynamics of the game, but if you just ""change your chip"" to socialism, the game actually does work.  It doesn't accurately mirror what happens in real socialist countries if all the players in the game actually cooperate, but perhaps that's the point:  socialism doesn't really work well because we don't really try to help each other as best as we can (defies human nature).  Also, when we played like socialist, my sister ""won"".  It's not fun to ""not win"", but that is because I still think like a capitalist.  If I thought like a real socialist though, in real life there is no end to the game, and if everyone is doing well, then I guess we all win.* We played again with the whole family and discovered the game has a lot more intricacies than we thought.  It really is the opposite though of classic Monopoly.

  I've played with these a few times, and so far, it's a good set. The cards feel nice, they aren't sticking together, and they don't bend easily (if you're not trying to bend them, of course). There is no card tray, so if that will be a problem, get one. There are some blank cards so you can make up your own, and they include some suggestions that I can see either being fun or, at least, entertaining to those watching. I haven't created my own cards yet, but I think any permanent marker should work fine.

  Our old Uno deck was chewed by the dog. I love the idea of the tin to keep the cards, but it‚Äôs too big. It has a plastic card holder inside which adds about an extra 2‚Äù to the size of the tin.

  This is a no-nonsense guide from a no-nonsense author.  Think Sun Tzu's Art of War overlaid across modern corporate board operations.

  Here I am wishing I could return this, but we opened it and played for 5 minutes, so I'm stuck with it. This is not ""Life"" by any stretch of the imagination. You get a car, you all start at different points, you get stars for.....something. There's charades, there's events you can go to or not go to. It's not Life, it's not even a little bit like Life, if you're looking for a ""Life Junior"", this isn't it. You're better off playing Life and going slowly with your kids, or just get a different game. This is NOT the Jedi you're looking for.

  I guess we are in the minority, but we weren't fans of this version of the game. Before this  purchase, we bought Monopoly Jr. and loved that it was an easy intro to a beloved game for our younger children. This particular game however, is nothing like the original Life. It's a cute enough game I suppose, but not at all what we were expecting. I would have much rather purchased the original Life for our kids and a children's charade game (since that was the only portion of this version any of us enjoyed). It's not necessarily bad, but if you are expecting this to be an easier version of the original game, it's not.

not impressed

  I played LIFE growing up, even at a young age, and I loved it.I was not impressed with this game.  I want something easy but a little challenging for my kids.  I would prefer something more as in buying toys, ice cream or school supplies with money instead of visiting or not visiting a playground, museum, etc.  There is really nothing to visit, it is just another space.  My kids were really waiting for something more.  My kids did not do well with the charades either.I would have also liked passing a certain space on the game where it is your birthday and everyone must give you a $1 (as in original LIFE) or you have to buy Mom a birthday gift and pay a $1 to the bank.......Things that relate more to a child's everyday life and wants and needs. This is cheaply made, not that interesting, and yes, as previous reviewers stated, the cheap spinner goes flying everywhere even knocking down the players and everyone has to remember what space they were on.  I may play this again over the summer but afterwards, I will donate it to our church.

Candy Land  meets the Real World...for Juniors
","

  So your kids have graduated from the iconic board game known as Candy Land.  Is it time for them to grow up? Maybe take on some responsibilities?  Manage their money, and use their skills in the Junior world?  Are they ready for Game of Life - Junior?!If your child is 8 and up - like my nephew, he would probably be better off playing Roblox or Minecraft or the adult version of Game of Life (which he won). If your child is under 8, the game may be better if you start off playing along with them instead of against them.Some Gold Stars:>>As far as board illustration it is completely beautiful.  Like Candy Land you want a board that ignites the imagination and I think the board-art in the Game of Life Junior does that well.>>It doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly like the original Game of LIfe.  As a Junior your life should be care-free; eating ice cream at the beach, visiting the zoo after having stuffing your face at the chocolate factory.  Imagination is key here, and I understand why they have those action cards.>>The introduction of money.  There‚Äôs no compound interest or mortgage but just the introduction of money is enough.The game is open for home renditions and rules. Instead of stars use animal crackers. Or try introducing fun-size packaged candy or fruit roll-ups as a side vendor to redeem that money.Some Black Stars:>>The spinner feels cheap, doesn‚Äôt feel random and has no suspense.  It is supposed to spin like a top but there‚Äôs too much friction.  One can control the spin depending on your pressure.  I say trade it in for a Pop-O-Matic (Trouble), or improve the spin, or use a die. I get it the adult life has the same spinner, I say trade that one in as well.>>‚ÄúMy Book of Adventures‚Äù is really just a single card where you place your stars that always seem to fall off. I would suggest that the deluxe version use magnetic backing.>>Some action (charade) cards are too difficult for young children and may prove to be frustrating:Winning a RaceThink of a Song and hum itThink of a Cartoon character and act like itScoring a goalPlaying catchMaking a cakeSack raceCrossing the roadA Circus ClownSpoon and Egg Race>>Certain action cards give two stars. It‚Äôs unclear if the player doing the action gets the stars or the player who guessed correctly or both.

  This is a great game for both my 4 and 6 year olds which often isn't the case (usually the games my 6 year old enjoys are over my youngest's level and the one my youngest likes are a little too easy to hold my eldest's excitement).  They really enjoy getting the yellow cards and figuring out what they need to do - sometimes the card gives a $1, sometimes it takes it away, sometimes it gives a star or 2, sometimes takes them away and some cards have you just share your favorite whatever, sometimes you get to act something out or finish singing a song. It's fun!  And we typically finish the game in about 15 minutes.

  I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday because she loves the idea of the Game of Life but just can't grasp the adult version yet. This game is a good premise and it's super cute, it just loses its magic when switching from adult to kids.We've only played this twice and she LOVES board games. All of her others are in constant use. I feel that they dumbed it down a little too much to try and help out kids. Some of the action cards are silly.For the most part it's an alright game, but I think we will probably just wait a little longer till she understands the adult version better!

Great junior version of Life
","

  This is a great junior edition of the classic game Life. My 5 year old loves it. This game does run a bit different, so reading the directions is important. My child loves the action cards. I like that they include a symbol that allows my child to identify if its something she needs to look at the picture to act out, or something that needs to be read to her. It helps allow this game be more independent where otherwise all the reading would make it a bit more of a challenge. The money is just $1 bills, so I cannot say this game helps with learning how to use money at all. Wish it at least worked with some other bills, and a little counting besides to 6 to move the car. My only negative comments are the spinner does not stay on the board, and I have lost track how many times it goes flying out of place when my child spins it. The colors on the spinner are not attached with the numbers, which makes the colors not line up right when you spin, which is also confusing. Overall, great game. And happy I found it.

  My son received Monopoly Junior and it‚Äôs perfect - a version for kids that‚Äôs easy to play and understand. I therefore figured I‚Äôd get the Game of Life Junior and this is.... bizarre. It‚Äôs easy enough to play but not at all even similar to the original. It makes no sense what you‚Äôre playing for or competing for. You act things out and get a star if someone guesses right? What is no one guesses right - how long does the guessing go? What incentive do people have to guess right if they don‚Äôt get a star? But that‚Äôs just one of the many absurd/silly components. I wish I could return it because it‚Äôs nonsensical and no fun.

Great for kids in speech

  My 3-year-old nephew was seeing a speech therapist but now because of COVID, my sister has been having a hard time trying to find things that can help him. He has his online classes, but shes told me it's just not the same as him being able to be physically there with the teacher/other children. I saw this game and thought it would be perfect for him and her. I had to take speech classes as a child so I know what it's like to need more interactive things like this to help me get out whatever I was trying to say. I love this setup as easy /simple as it is. the words are basic and easy enough for a 3 year old child. and its helpful not only for word pronuctiation but for learning what things are, and it even can help with learning math. Great little product/game for children still learning words & pictures

  Returned a digital spelling game becasue I didn't want my child using more electronics then necessary. I prefer this old fashioned simple spelling game. Feels a little flimsy but really nothing on it is breakable so doesn't matter too much. I love the size of the dice and cards. Perfect for lite hands. The cards are colorful and fun to use. I'd recommend if you are trying to steer away from all the apps and ipads.

  There are so many learning games out there! Some are sooo expensive and they give the same results. It‚Äôs all about how involved you are with your kids. We played with our 5 year old and she was loving it. It can be just the same old boring flash cards ‚Äúgame‚Äù or you can add a timer and switch from sounds to letter recognition, to number association, to basic math. It really turns it into a fun game! My daughter absolutely loved it. Due to the timer we had to move quick and the flash cards were great and didn‚Äôt really bend!

  One of the reviews said this comes with the original ""adult"" board on the back of it. This is not the case! The board on the back is completely blank. No extra point spaces. In addition to that, the letters are all cardboard, super flimsy! And it doesn't come with a little stand to set your pieces in. If your children are reading, just buy the original Scrabble. If they're not, maybe you'd want this one or maybe you'd want to just help them... Either way, I'm returning this and buying the original. Cardboard tiles are not going to last long with children.

Happy with it.

  We bought this for my step daughter when she was 6.  She enjoys playing board games and  we wanted to help her focus on spelling because she was struggling with it.  The one side of the board have pre-spelled words that the child can match up the letters for from the letters that they have drawn out.  I am a teacher and this would help a young child with letter recognition and letter name.  Once they have moved on from the easier side of the board, they can play by creating their own words.  This abstract thought can be a bit difficult for young kids so keeping the words to 3 or four letters at first is a good idea.  This is a great game to help foster letter name, letter recognition, and allowing them to generate their own words.  After you have spelled a word it might even be a good idea to have the child read the word that you created.  This is a good beginning reader game.

The characters are cute, the colors are bright.  I love that it has 2 sides, one for more of a matching game, and the other is a regular scrabble board for when they're ready to move up to level 2.  I wish it had extra tiles, for back up in case the originals get lost.  There are just enough to finish the level 1 side.  It would also be great if it came with a bag to keep the tiles in, but otherwise, the game is great!

She was so happy to have a version she could play

  We got this for our kindergartener for Christmas. She was so happy to have a version she could play! There are two versions, printed on each side of the board. One side has the words printed on it already, and you place letter tiles at each turn to complete a word. Scoring is simple, too. After a couple games of the ""beginner"" side, we turned it over and played on the ""regular"" board. There are no special scoring spaces like classic Scrabble, since this has simpler scoring also, but it was still fun to play with her. The only thing I'd suggest to improve the game is to have a few more letter tiles to use. For the preprinted side, it's perfect, but more having only those letters limits playing on the slightly more advanced side.

  My grandsons are 7and 5 years old and they love to play scrabble junior!! They love the competition of the game. Everyone gets seven tiles then you have to choose your player there are different colors (red,blue,yellow, green) and on the board there are certain words with your color bordering the letters of the word. if you fill a word in your color space you get a move your character on the board two spaces if you fill a word that is not in your color you move one space.. When it‚Äôs your turn you put two of your tile on any word on the board ,preferably yours but any word will do.  after you lay your two tiles down you collect two tiles from the extras just as you would do in regular scrabble. we put our extra in a little bag with a zipper,  no bag for the tiles comes with Scrabble Junior. We as a family play this game pretty often!! So much fun and I enjoy watching the kid have a blast and  learning!!FYI.. on the flipside of the board there is a Scrabble board just with no writing like ,double word score, or points for a certain letter on the tiles, that type a thing!! We haven‚Äôt use that side yet but we will!!

  Fun with letters and words, and a great way to introduce the concepts of the game of Scrabble. Five year old not interested, but I played it with 7 year old who loved it. She wanted to make her own words, and was disappointed that there aren't any blank tiles, but caught on quickly to the basic level of simply matching the words on the board. There is a little strategy but mostly just fun and luck of the draw. Now older sibling will show the younger one. Quality is lightweight, and I hope they won't lose the little tiles. It was appealing enough for older one to put down a tablet and play a board game.

  The only reason I'm deducting a star is for packaging.  Lately board games like this are designed so that the packaging is advertising, rather than practical.

  I bought a handful of word-type games for our family to play together with my little one (4 years old) and this game is GREAT! It's very easy to understand (letter-matching) and helps to associate spelling with the pictures as well. The little characters that it comes with and the board-game aspect where the characters advance around the board as you earn points is cute. You can change rules to fit your style of game play. We score a point for every letter of a completed word to make the game a bit faster, so a 5-letter word advances your character 5 spaces around the board, for little ones with short attention spans. The only thing I don't like is the way the board folds. It has a cut along one crease which I can almost guarantee will eventually tear and render the board broken.

  I purchased Junior Scrabble to encourage my 6 and 7 year old grandchildren to continue to work on their phonics work. They love using the side where they cover the letters of words that exist. They're not at the point of putting together their own words, but are finding where they can substitute letters in words that exist. We count a point for every word that's completed. They're beginning to learn how to strategize so they (not I) are left to complete a word. This works in many ways!

  This is a great game for kids starting to read. My daughter loves it and wants to play it all the time. it can be played in an easy more where predefined words are already set and earn points as tiles are put in in the board and more ""advanced"" mode where you can form your own words and play it similarly as one for adults. Initially I though that this will be difficult for my 6yo (which is in KG) but not at all. As she's experiencing and learning to read she found it fun and easy to play. Another thing to note is that this game is actually really fine for a parent and kid to play with to make it fun, I haven't play it with more than 2 players but I'd guess that we will finish it within 10 min if more than 3 players are there.

  I would not purchase again. 6&7 year old love playing both sides, working on their own spelling and strategies on the other. However within the first week tiles were damaged (one lost) and the board ripped in half. My children were not rough with the pieces but the board was hard for them to figure out how to fold (it is already split halfway down the center to fold into fours. The cardboard tiles also moved too easily on the board itself, so the words wouldn‚Äôt stay straight. I also wish it came with a tray for the letters, as they became more competitive (which took about 2 days) they didn‚Äôt want each other seeing their tiles. I liked that they had little characters to move and scoring is easy but I will probably end up ordering a different game.  Definitely not worth $18, maybe less than $10.

  Bought this game because I liked that you could flip the board and have the adult version without having to invest down the road on the upgrade.  She is working on reading and I thought this would be an excellent way to practice words and sounds.  So my teen and I sat down and played with her expecting to be bored and just get through a round or two to placate her but we ending up playing for two hours.  The game has preset words printed on the board and the goal is to work on words but to not complete enough to help out your opponents.  You have to look from player to player to make sure you aren't leaving them a chance to complete your word you have been working on.  My seven year old got the swing of not helping your opponents after a round or two and we play smoothly now and sometimes we team and she has the better idea on what to lay down because she understands the concept so well now.  I definitely would recommend this to a friend.

  I love this game! One side is pre-printed with early reader words with matching pictures (car, kitten, etc.) and each person places  just two letter tiles per turn, and the person that finishes the word gets a point. The other side is a regular scrabble board. You get the best of both worlds!

  Such a fun game! My oldest son had the older Scrabble Jr. and I was so excited to find a newer version. My 6yo and I have the best time playing these games.  It is great for both spelling and word recognition. The triangle chips have been replaced with little men that move around the board as you complete a word. So cute!

  This is a great game to play with your kids. There is an easier side with premise words you can build your tiles on while your child is learning how to read. Then there is the more challenging board where you and your kids build your own words. I play this all the time with my 6 and 4 year old and we have had this game for 2 years now.

  This was a Christmas gift for my 5 year old twin nieces. I find the step one version easy to play with these beginning readers/spellers. I love the easier format - and the fact there are steps built into the game which allow for growth before bridging to the full version. I think we'll enjoy this for a couple of years so a good investment. So many games geared toward this age group are outgrown so quickly I hesitate to spend the money but I'm pleased with this purchase.

I do like TTR USA more
","

  UPDATE: I have now switched my review from 1 star to 5 stars. After contacting several representatives, we were finally referred to the counterfeit team. They have now opened a ticket and refunded our money! Thank you, Amazon!As for the game, itself, I do like TTR USA more. Europe adds a different level of play. It was a little odd with the ferries and tunnels. You have to have multiple locomotives in your hand, just in case. I felt like we spent more time accumulating cards that we may or may not need instead of actually playing. It was nice to play on a different map.We had purchased this game and was not able to open it during to life circumstances until almost a year later. We received a counterfeit version with 5 train stations, missing red trains, and bubbly paper on the board that wasn't glued properly. I didn't think it was a counterfeit because the cards, box, and game board all had that linen-look finish, but it was!We knew we were way past the 30 day return window, but Amazon has been good to us in the past and we read on some board game forums how Amazon exchanged their game past the return window, so we gave it a try.The Amazon associate we talked to, while kind, was wholly unhelpful. He just kept repeating, ""I am not authorized to approve."" over and over. I'm hugely disappointed in how Amazon has handled this. Like I said, we were past the return window (our fault), but Amazon has knowledge of these counterfeit games. I'm more upset in the fact that these counterfeit games are completely unregulated. My family has played one game with it before we realized it was an incomplete game so I have no idea what substances my family was handling (lead? asbestos?).Amazon did not care.Our associate kindly offered us to buy another game.We regularly buy games from Amazon and will no longer do so.

My Favorite Version of Ticket to Ride
","

  Fantastic game and my favorite version of Ticket to Ride. Below I list out the features that I think make this version more interesting, or at least different, than other versions.But first! I do have to report that the first game box that was shipped to us was damaged (no damage on the box it was shipped in). I didn't bother opening it to see if there were missing game pieces, I just ordered an exchange. The new game arrived two days later - no damage and no missing pieces. Reading the reviews, a lot of people have this issue. This shouldn't be happening! But at least the exchange process was easy.Interesting game play features:1) Train stations - Train stations allow you to use a single claimed route of one your opponents to connect two cities. If the city in which you place the train station has multiple claimed routes originating from it, you need to specify which connection you are using. Knowing that you won't completely ruin your planned path when someone claims a route you wanted adds a bit of relief; however, you still have to use train stations sparingly. You only get 3, and for any unused stations, you get 4 extra points at the end of the game.2) Tunnels and Ferries - This map has both tunnels and ferries. This adds many complications to your strategy while claiming routes. The most obvious being that for ferry routes you'll need locomotives (wild cards) and for tunnels you may want to have a few extra cards of the color route your claiming, or perhaps some extra locomotives. On maps that only have ferries or tunnels, the people I play with tend to be less motivated to pick up wilds, especially with Ticket to Ride: US, which is tunnels only.3) Only 3 Long Routes - The map has two routes that are 6 train cars in length (15 points) and one that is 8 train cars (21 points) and all three are either a tunnel or ferry route. The US version had multiple routes along the top that are 5 or 6 train cars long. Claiming those routes, coupled with the destination tickets connecting the east and west coasts can allow you to rack up a serious amount of points and take a commanding lead over your opponents. With a fewer number of high point routes, and the fact that these routes are harder to claim, you may find yourself changing your strategy a bit.4) Only One High Point Destination Ticket per Person - Each player only gets one high point destination ticket (blue background) at the start of the game and the rest are placed back in the box. You can choose to discard it before game play starts, but you won't get a chance to pick up another.4) Regular-Sized Cards - This may sound silly, but it drives me crazy that the US version has smaller sized train cards and destination tickets. It makes it annoying to sort through the cards in your hand if you have a lot of train cards. It's also annoying to shuffle the decks. Luckily, the cards for the Europe version are a normal size (think traditional set of cards). As it should be!

FANTASTIC FAMILY GAME
","

  If you are new to Ticket to Ride, I strongly suggest that you start with the original game. Every other version adds an additional level of complexity. This review consists of the Ticket to Ride games which we have purchased and enjoyed playing. I can highly recommend all of them.TICKET TO RIDE (original)The board consists of a map of the U.S. and parts of Canada. Routes are delineated between major cities. The object of the game is to connect routes which are displayed on your personal route cards using train cars. Extra points are awarded for ‚Äúlongest route‚Äù.The game takes about 5 minutes to learn and is loads of fun for the entire family. Each turn, the player chooses from one of three options. Gameplay is rapid. Blink and it‚Äôs your turn again! We all really enjoy this game. I particularly like that there is absolutely no way to tell who is going to win until the end, when each player tallies her or his points. This all but eliminates the competitive element and allows you to just enjoy playing the game.TICKET TO RIDE - EUROPEThe board consists of a European map which will have you scratching your head as you butcher pronunciations. Thankfully, the cards are larger. Added elements include tunnel and ferry routes, train stations, and long route destination cards. While the added elements are very enjoyable, it really helps to be familiar with the original version first.ALVIN AND DEXTOR - Monster Expansion PackPlace your monster on any city and no routes can be claimed in or out of that city until the monster is moved. This is a favorite.USA 1910 EXPANSIONReplace those sissy cards from the original deck with normal-size cards!ASIA: MAP COLLECTION - VOLUME 1The board is two-sided. You can play as teams (which we‚Äôve never done) or play your way through Asia the old-fashioned way. Mountain routes are added.

Better than the original!
","

  I now own Ticket to Ride: Europe and Ticket to Ride: Nordic.  I enjoy Europe, but Nordic remains my favorite.  Here are some of the good and bad things about Ticket to Ride: Europe, compared to both Nordic and the original (USA) version.Pros:+ More complex than the original with the addition of locomotives, tunnels, and stations.  (Stations aren't in Nordic.)+ Plays up to 5 players, a potential improvement on Nordic if you play with larger groups.+ Some cities will be more familiar and easier to find than in Nordic.  (And easier to find if you're European!)Cons:- Art is not as pretty as in Nordic and the cards feel slightly lower quality.- Compared to the US edition, the cities may be unfamiliar and harder to find for American players.- While it scales from 2-5, it does not play as smoothly with 2-3 players as Nordic does.  If you are only/mainly playing with 2-3, I'd highly recommend Nordic over either Europe or the US versions.Overall this a really fun game that can be enjoyed with just about any group.  It is strategic enough to hold your interest while simple enough to teach in 5 minutes.  If you already have the US Ticket to Ride, it's worth getting this one for the added components which make it a slightly heavier game.

Poor Quality Game

  Edit - received a replacement; board better but still poor quality compared to original Ticket to Ride game. Main fold point of board is splitting.  Received the 15 train station pieces in the replacement game.  Game play gets a 5 stars, quality of components received get 2 stars.  I just can't get the energy to return this again so I will deal with the flaws.  At least it is playable this time.Original - Poor quality board was wrinkled and warped, making the game essentially unplayable.  Cards and trains were well made. Set was missing 10 of the 15 train station pieces needed to play.  I've played the game before at a friend's house so I know it is fun; just this copy was unplayable.

Fun game but names of cities not in English

  We previously played the US version with friends of ours and decided to purchase the European version. The board is beautiful and there are some fun additions to the game. However one thing that we were not aware of prior to purchasing is that the names of the cities in Europe are written in the language of each country. Sometimes those are very similar to the English word for the city, but sometimes they are extremely different. This makes it much harder to find some of the routes, especially for the people  we previously played the US version with friends of ours and decided to purchase the European version.

Great game to play for those looking for something different
","

  I love playing video games but at times I want to take a break from viewing a monitor or TV screen.  My wife and I enjoy a few board games and playing cards, but I wanted some more in-depth to play that is not Monopoly, Sorry, Uno, and etc.  I would love to play games like Risk or something in those veins, but I know she will not be up for it. My first tough was to get Catan, but sadly we need at least three players, and my daughter is barely 8 months, so she doesn‚Äôt count.I was looking for a game that would fit all these requirements and still be fun for her, but be something that was a little different and I remembered a game I got for free on my iPad a few months back called Ticket to Ride.  I remembered having a lot of fun with it but playing against AI was not as fun after a while. I did some research on this game and showed my wife to see if she would be interested.  We found that they had another version that was based in Europe instead of the US, and since we love traveling, we opted to get this out.  Boy, it was a great investment.The night that it came my in-laws were over for dinner, and I asked if they wanted to play.  They said sure to try something else.  I was a little concerned as the instructions were a book, and it had a rule that was not in the iPad game since this was a newer version, but we opted to play the game in sections and introduce more advanced features (such as the Stations, ferries, and tunnels) with each new time we played.My in-laws and wife were hooked on his game. It is so simple to play yet, it is also complicated and provides a nice bit of strategy if you want to win.  If you notice someone is trying to get to a particular place, do you be a jerk and claim that line, but you could risk losing your own line later?  It is really fun to see how each game goes.I will admit the first game we played we had major issues fining some of the Eastern European locations, and none of us have been (or recognize) a few of the names, but after a couple of play thoughts, we now have a great grasp on everything.  What I like is that each game can be done in about 30 min to 1 hour. This is great because anything longer would be too hard, as the baby could wake up and spoil the rest of the game. We have not had this be an issue where a game went over that time frame (yet).The concept for this game is SUPER simple, but it takes a while to master. Mark train lines to get from Point A to Point B in the faster route possible. You do this by collecting a train card.  You have to have a specific color of train cards to claim a route.  What makes this interesting is you can only do one of three things each time it is your turn:1. Claim a Route2. Pull Train Cards (from stack or on the board)3. Get another route cardSo you have to plan each turn carefully.  Is it worth claiming a route, when you see a while card in the open deck?  You are out of routes, but do you use your turn to do something else.  Each route you claim is worth a certain amount of points, and the object is to get the most points before someone has less than two of their own person trains.  Just because you get rid of all your trains doesn‚Äôt mean you win, as we have had a game where other people win as they claimed more complicated routes.This is a great game to play and we look forward to teaching our daughter it when she is a bit older, as it is just different from other games currently out on the market, and it makes for a really great time!

Fast and addicting game but limited to you and 4 others
","

  Pros- for a relatively inexperienced boardgame player, this is a pick up and play game with easy to understand rules- game is not heavily reliant on luck and starting first doesnt give a huge advantage. There are multiple strategies that can be used to play the game, increasing replayability.- compared to the original USA version, the train and destination cards are much larger and easier to read- map itself is a bit cluttered, with cities closer to each other. Like Europe in real life. Allows for players to maneuver around one another with more ease.- tunnels and ferries make the locomotive card much more valuable, making it more likely to be picked by a player- fast gameplay allows players to feel engaged. The points obtained by completing destination means that no one white knows which players is in the leadCons- quite expensive expansion packs.- 2-5 player limit can be an issue for folks with larger group of friends. There are some maps that allow 6 players, but I understand that it required teams of 2 and either the Asian expansion or the wild west expansion. Not cheap

  This game was a present for my 10 year old grandson.  He had play Ticket to Ride America at a friend's house and loved it.  We thought the Europe version would be a little different and also help everyone learn European geography.  However all the cities are printed in old world spellings and were hard to decipher.  Writing them in modern English as well as the names of the countries would be much better.  The game itself is quite fun.  We had 4 of us playing and it took quite a bit longer than an hour.  Also if you bump the board at all the trains move around.  Some way to attach the trains so they don't move would be helpful. It is very challenging mentally and in spite of my complaints we are enjoying it.

  Extremely fun game. My game group is pretty diverse in their preferred games, but this one is loved by all. Fair bit of luck, but stragedy definitely comes into play a lot as well. It is also a very visual game so for me ,seeing the trains on the map, quickened the learning curve.I would personally recommend new players start with the American map version though, because the Europe version has added tunnels, and they are confusing. Especially for new players. It would also be easier because as an American, I know where the cities are and I'm not looking all over the board. Also thought I'd mention ita fun as 2 player. Me and my wife played 3 games straight when we opened it.

Watch an online ""how to play"" video -- but great fun for whole family!

  Despite having multiple ivy grads and PhDs in our family, reading the instruction manual was laborious, painful, and also directed us the wrong way. In fact, we played a couple of rounds totally ""wrong"" (though still had fun). Perhaps if we were board game aficionados and used to the language, it would have made more sense... However, all this could have been avoided by watching a 5minute YouTube video. Lesson learned.That said, this game is great fun! The right mix of strategy, luck, and mild sabotage! For the most part, this is very casual and enjoyable and not much resentment to fellow players--which i personally hate, so great to not have this be one of those! It does get mildly stressful toward the end game, but otherwise a lot more chill than a lot of games can be. As promised, easy to learn for the whole family--just watch a youtube video as i mentioned :)Overall, love it. Glad this was my first version of the game that I was introduced to b/c i think reading reviews of the original, i prefer the game play options in this version (with the train stations).

Love Europe TTR and its challenging game play
","

  This version of TTR is challenging and fun! You have ferry's to cross which require ""wild"" train cards and underground railroads which can leave you in a pinch if the luck of the draw isn't in your favor. This is one of our favorite TTR games because of the numerous destinations and the challenges on the board (ferrys/underground railroads) My daughter likes the tunnels that allow you to connect to another players train in order to complete your destination into cities where multiple train destinations get tricky.  Game play lasts about an hour and we are fairly familiar with the destination locations. This is a stand alone game and does not require another TTR purchase in order to be played.

  Complex. We love the Basic Ticket to Ride (also a complex game but SUCH fun)! We'd tired of it, the US map, so decided to add this one to our game closet. I think it's unfortunate that it's an ancient European map; doesn't teach about where the same cities are with contemporary names. I'd like it more if it included the ancient names AND those that are used now. This game has added tunnels and ferries which add some interest. So far, though, I don't think it compares to the original Ticket to Ride.

More of a challenge than classic TTR
","

  I first learned Ticket To Ride on the iPhone. I'm used to the American map and the geography makes sense to me. The European map is so foreign, it takes me while to figure out where the cities are and sometimes I forfeit tickets because I mistake some cities for others. On the other hand, I think it is good because I learn new geography and cities.This version has tunnels so it's not as easy as the regular TTR, which I guess should be a plus for me, because I am supposed to like a challenge. I think there is a lot of potential to learn from this game, which may require some research on the cities we are actually visiting.

  If you like Ticket to Ride, you should definitely play this one.  The tunnels and stations add welcome twists to the base game-play.  It is a little challenging to try to locate cities on the map until you memorize them though.  They have old-world names that don't always match up with what they currently are.  However, it still helps you learn some geography during a fun-filled game session.  Also, a nice update for this is that the cards are normal poker-size instead of the little ones in the original.  Overall, I like this one better.

More involved version of Ticket to Ride for 1-5 players

  If you have four to five players and are looking for something a bit more meaty than the original Ticket to Ride, this is probably the best version.In my opinion, if you own this version the only reason to play the original Ticket to Ride is if you just love playing on the US map, or if you're playing with people who like the rules to be as simple as possible. Ticket to Ride Europe introduces new elements like tunnels, ferries, and stations, that increase the complexity, but not by much.If you normally play with two or three people, Ticket to Ride Nordic Countries is a better fit as it has a tighter map.

Love this Game, and Good Geography Lesson Too
","

  I bought this as a Christmas gift for our 7-year-old after I played it at a meet-up party. The board is full of train tracks and destinations. You draw cards with routes from one destination to another at the start of the game. Then you build track to connect your destinations through the game. You can lay track for as many routes as you can, until someone runs out of track to lay. Then you count up points to see who won. The rules are a little complex, but make it a very fun game to play. It really grows on you. Once you figure out some of the strategies, it becomes more fun. You are supposed to keep your route, and your track cards secret, but I have found with new players, it is easier to make all of these visible for the first couple of games, so that everyone can help each other and get used to the rules.I bought the Europe version specifically because it has double tracks in a lot of places. We live in the U.S., and I was going to buy the U.S. version. Someone at the meet-up made the astute suggestion that I stick with Europe if I was buying for a child, because the U.S. version only has single tracks. It was very good advice. When a set of tracks is taken up, it is a lot more difficult to get to reach a destination, and this can be frustrating for the younger child. We may buy the U.S. version in the future. There are several versions, and they are not all the same. The game, Risk, helped me remember where places were in Europe and Asia. This game will do that also.My 3 older kids are 21, 24, and 26. They have talked about ""gaming meet-ups"" for a long time, but I never understood what they were until a visit to my 24 y/o's last fall. He sent me rules to a bunch of games before I went, to prepare me. Ticket to Ride was one of them. I assumed we would be playing computer games. Nope. Apparently the 20-something crowd has taken board game parties to a new level. Meet-ups are loosely organized groups, arranged online, where people get together just to play board games. My 24 y/o and his girlfriend took me to a Halloween party one in Phoenix, complete with costumes. There were all kinds of people there, including college professors. Some of these people apparently become lifelong friends. They told me Ticket To Ride was one of the regular games they played. So it is up to snuff.

My Favorite Version of My Favorite Board Game
","

  I first started playing the original Ticket to Ride (USA map) with friends several years ago and fell in love with it.  I'd always wanted to buy the game for myself but one thing or another would get in the way causing me to have to postpone.  A couple months ago a friend suggested to me that I should buy the Ticket to Ride Europe version when I finally got the chance because it had some really great added elements.  I took their word of advice and decided to get the European version, and I haven't been disappointing.  While I still love the original Ticket to Ride it has been a lot of fun to test my European geography skills.  The names of cities are written in historical/local names instead of current names (ie. Moskova instead of Moscow, Wien instead of Vienna) so some of my friends had trouble catching their bearings but they caught on quickly.  I like the added element of being given the choice of completing one long route for many points (the long route cards are kept desperately from the other route cards) instead of solely shorter routes or having the long routes mixed in to all of the route cards.  I also like the added element of train stations which, especially in route laden western Europe is sometimes the only way you can complete your routes when so many people are going for the same paths.The only con is the game can be kind of dull to play with only 2 people, oftentimes I find that we end up playing on opposite sides of the continent, never crossing paths, but with more than two it can get quite complicated and exciting.

It's pretty amazing, and comes with a couple more challenges than the original game. (I love trying to pronounce all the old cities of Europe.) The basic rules are the same as they are in Ticket to Ride, gameplay follows the same general order. On your turn, you collect train car cards to get enough to go from one city to another, (If the track has three green spaces, you need three green cards) to accomplish the route on your destination tickets. ""Europe"" comes with train stations allowing you to connect easier, and also the foreboding ferries and tunnels. The ferries are routes that cross any body of water (makes sense, right?) and you must have, in addition to your cards of the same color, however many locomotives (wild cards) shown on that part of your route. (Example: ""Palermo"" to ""Roma"" is a gray track ferry with 4 parts. One of them must be a wild and the other three could be a matching three of any color.) Then there are the tunnels, which are like others, except, after you lay down your cards, before placing your trains on the board, you must flip over the first three cards on the train car card draw deck. If one, two or all three are either the colors you are playing to go from city to city, or wilds, you must have that many more cards of that color (or wilds.) Example: you are trying to go from ""Paris"" to ""Zurich"" (which is a gray tunnel route, 3 long), so you play two blues and a wild card. Before placing your trains on the board, you flip over the first card. Say it's a green. No problem. Then, you flip over a second card and it's a white. Good so far. Then, flip over the last card and it's a wild (which counts as a blue.) This means, you must (in addition to the three cards you are playing) play one more blue or wild card in your hand to go on that route. If there were two flipped over, you must have an additional two, and the same if all three. (Of course, there are times when none of the three present a problem and you can play your route like normal, which is nice.) If you don't have either a blue or a wild, you cannot play there and your turn ends. Now, that was kind of a long-winded example, but it makes it quite a bit harder, especially if you have a route that has many tunnel tracks. It can also be VERY frustrating. To sum it up, Ticket to Ride Europe is a very fun game that is easily taught, easily learned and easily played.Anyways,

  Wow I got this for a gift, my friend is from Germany. This version was so much fun especially since it has other variants like the tunnels. We have played it like the U.S. version so far  but will add the tunnel part in as people become more familiar with the game. This will make the game more interesting for sure.

  It's all up to you! Pick your cards for the route and go for it by collecting your series of trains to build your line. Oops! Did someone cut you off? Pick another route and keep moving. Don't forget, along the way that you can also pick other route cards that might be little spurs and gain you big points in the end-game count-up for the winner. don't forget to keep counting how many trains you have left because you can find yourself snookered by one piece and not reach your final destination. Sorry no points for a half-done train line from Constantinople to Zagreb! Tooot- Tooot! Love this game!

  I read the reviews on this game and watched some YouTube video reviews as well and decided to purchase it for some new euro style gaming.  I previously had purchased another euro style game called Carcassonne which is now a family favorite (or should I say favourite) and I was looking for something else to add to the gaming mix.Ticket To Ride Europe fit with what I was looking for.  I first compared the two prominent versions of the game: the USA map to the Europe map and read comparison reviews on them both before deciding to buy.  I went with the Europe version of the game because it seems there were more route paths to connect your cities compared to the USA map.  What I did not expect was the names of the European cities to be really old and spelled differently than what I am used to now.  I think it was done this way to fit into the time period, but not being that familiar with the old names of the European cities it was difficult for us to determine our various routes.  The route cards do show a mini map though with highlights in the general area of the two cities you need to connect, but it is still a bit difficult especially for the younger kids in the family.  What this means is that we need to take extra time in looking at our route cards and the map to decide on our paths to build.Other than getting used to the city names the only other minor downside I see in the game is that there are so many train pieces.  You have to be really careful not to drop them all over the place when picking up.  The game does come with 2 extra train pieces per color which is good in case you lose a couple.  After that though you may have to dock everyone a piece if you really start losing some (or buy a new game).Regarding the game play, it is great!  Not too difficult to learn at all and once everyone knows what they have to do it moves along at a good pace.  Although our initial games of 4 and then 5 people lasted about 2.5 hours each to play which everyone thought was a bit too long.  The non players passing through the room kept making comments like ""You guys are STILL playing that game?!?!"" and ""When the hell is it going to be over already?!?"".  But those of us playing the game were not fatigued at all by the amount of time it was taking us to get through it.  I think it is conceivable to have a game last maybe 1.5 hours on average.Overall, the family really liked this game.  It is definitely a must for a unique and new type of gaming experience that is interactive and not just your boring roll the dice and move type thing.  I will be getting the Ticket To Ride 1912 Expansion pack for this game as well since I have read it adds a couple more elements to the play in addition to some new route cards.UPDATE: It has been about 1 year now since I had the game and I did get the 1912 expansion which adds a ton more route cards to the game.  We have been playing this game so much that the base routes kept coming up and it was getting a bit boring.  It seemed like we were always getting the same routes game after game.  The 1912 Expansion is a MUST.  My family is addicted to this game and even more so with the 1912 expansion.  This is a GREAT GAME.

  The cities are listed in their native language, so it is sometimes hard to find them on the board, but the cards have little maps on them which helps. This is a more intricate game than the American version, and I like it a lot better because there is more strategy.

  We really enjoyed this game! We've only played once so far. We started looking into the rules and information before lunch, then that took long enough to fully understand that we had lunch in the middle before playing. Playing took about an hour and was fun for all of us, ages 9, 11, and two adults. Obviously the next time we play we won't need to learn the rules again so that will save time, but it was worth it to understand everything first. We're excited to play again! We also enjoy getting a small refresher of European geography, haha!

Strikes a Very Nice Balance
","

  My husband and I are strategy game, card game, ""Euro Game,"" etc. enthusiasts. This is a board game that I've wanted for awhile and am so glad I finally ordered. Pretty artwork. Fun. Can be played by 2, but having a few more players adds more competition to it as you become less likely to complete your goals when vying with several players for the same train tracks. The thing I really like about this game is that it has some strategy to it without being nearly as complex as hard core strategy games to either teach or play. We certainly enjoy those games, but it can, understandably, be tedious to some family and friends to spend hours learning many of the games we have, especially if they're not total game geeks or won't be playing them again anytime soon, so I wanted something we could offer to a wider range of guests, that'd be fun for all. This is one of those nice, ""invite the fam and friends of nearly all patience levels, who enjoy games but aren't total game geeks to sit down and have fun playing while not being bored ourselves"" games. Anyone we've introduced it to (frequent gamers and occasional alike) has enjoyed it, it leaves room for as much visiting as playing, and we do find it fun ourselves!

My family's favorite game
","

  My family (kids 9 and 11) loves this game. I wish I'd chosen the American version, just because the names of places are from the old days (I know, this shouldn't have been a surprise to me!) so we've had to learn the place names which can make it a little trickier. The first couple times out were a bit rough, but once we all had the gist of it we loved it. My kids also like Catan, so perhaps if your family enjoys that, this is another good option.

After reading all the reviews online, this game did not disappoint. Great one to play with 5 other friends!
","

  I would quite easily recommend this game. It has got rave reviews online and I have to say it did not disappoint. We played it for the first time on Boxing Day with my family and after reading the monologue of rules (only downside) we just got stuck into it and it all came together. Made much more sense and much more enjoyable when we got stuck in and played. Just fair warning, the rules seem a little overwhelming at first (especially when you read them out). Much easier if you get the gist and then just start playing. It makes loads more sense.Game differences from the original works great for me. I kinda purchased this game for these new additions. Most of my friends are new to boardgames so games that are tough/non-forgiving can be too off-putting. I really like the use of the stations, tunnels and ferries. The tunnels really add an aspect of luck-of-the-draw to the game, which isn't everyone's favourite but I thought it helped even out the game play between veterans and beginners. It can be frustrating missing out on a tunnel, believe me, I tried 4 times to get one tunnel to win the game but even to my last play, I missed out on the draw. But it made for a very dramatic and suspenseful game, everyone was hanging out to see if I would get it.I would recommend tallying up your trains at end of game play and re-calculating your points. It's easy to forget to move your counter and most of time we've been out a couple of points.

  Have now played this one and the US one and I prefer the US one. I thought it would be good to learn the geography of Europe but the cities are written in their home language name, like Roma for Rome.

There is also some additional game details on the Europe game, but the first time we played we ignored them and it went ok without.

My family played it for the first time this week and loved it. With kids 13, 11, and 9 it took a little longer to explain (kids were up very late that night evoking an apology from me to my wife) but it was worth it. Already looking forward to to next time we play. The Europe edition may be a little more complex but it's the added choices that keep it more engaging without anyone getting so easily locked out early in the game. Highly recommend.

  I love this game, but my brand new game came without the round wooden markers to track your score on the outside of the game board.  I registered my game and went to Contact Us.  If you bought your game in the USA, you have to return the game to the seller if there is a problem and work it out with them.  As much as these games cost, that is not a good customer service move.  =(  I'm just getting something else I can use for markers.  Much less hassle than returning the whole game.

  This is an entertaining and fun board game.  The Europe version is one of a series of 'Ticket to Ride' board games.  We've played the Europe and American versions.  They are both good, and there are slight variations in the games which makes it interesting to try each different game.  The games require about 2 to 3 hours depending on familiarity and number of players.  The initial reaction of everyone we play with is that the game seems very complicated.  Be patient and within 20-30 minutes, you'll get it and change your opinion.The objective is to score the most points by completing train route across the playing board.  There is quite a bit of strategy involved, including preventing opponents from completing routes on occasion.If you enjoy board games, I think you'll like this one.

Each game is different since there are so many combinations of routes. I have become a master at playing this. It's tough finding great games that two people can play. Most games are for 3-4 or more players. I was hesitant on spending the money but I'm glad I did.

  The game is remarkably simple, yet fun in a lot of ways.  It adds some nice elements to the original Ticket to Ride, such as the use of train stations, tunnels, and the new long routes cards.  The overall gameplay is fairly similar, with the standard color cards and missions.  Adding the tunnels presents a unique and fun challenge and the need to use locomotives for certain routes also adds a new difficulty element.The game is simple enough that most people will be able to pick it up easily in just a couple of turns, less even with any experience playing the original Ticket to Ride.We've played the original game for several years now and decided to try a new version for a little variation and were not disappointed.

  Ticket to Ride Europe is a great game to add to your library of tabletop games. I never wanted to play the original Ticket To Ride because it had one major flaw (in my opinion), getting blocked. Now you might be thinking, ""Isn't that part of the game and strategy even?"" and you'd be right, it is, until it happens to you and then the game sucks, and life sucks, and you hate your friends, and trains, and you're glad you never rode a train. Yep, that's pretty much what's like. Unless you're the person who ALWAYS wins and everyone hates and you don't care cause you ALWAYS win. And you happen to be the owner of the game.Anyways, Europe version helps to nullify that, though it can still happen, it's less frequent. This is done by the addition of 3 train stations each player starts with at the beginning of the game. Throughout the game players can play a station on a city connected to one of their trains which allows them to ""use"" another player's train route touching that city as if it was her own. For example; Sue blocks John by building a train from Rome to Milan, John plays a trains station on Rome and then uses Sue's train (the one she just built) as if it was his own, to complete his route.And that's it, and that's why I give it 4 stars instead of 2, like I would the original. It adds a few other interesting elements but is generally the same as the original.If you're on the fence about this one I'd lean towards getting it. And that's saying something because I really really dislike the original.

One of the best new games out there!
","

  This game is fantastic. I mean, addicting. The premise is simple enough that most kids or teenagers can easily catch on and any adult will find it fun and interesting. If you haven't played any Ticket to Ride games, the premise is that you claim tracks between cities to complete various routes, while other players are doing the same thing for different routes.The Europe edition is different from the debut US edition in that it: (1) uses a Europe map, obviously; (2) adds ferries, requiring one or two locomotive cards to cross water; (3) adds tunnels, meaning a section of track in mountainous areas could cost up to three extra train cards; and (4) adds train stations, which allow you to ""borrow"" someone else's track between two cities to complete a route. These changes are all for the better, I think. They make some tracks more challenging or more of a gamble to acquire, and they allow for a means to complete routes even if other players block one of your destination cities.There are so many different strategies you can use and so much variation each time the game is played that it takes a long time for this game to get old. Each game lasts anywhere from 30-60 minutes, so it's not a huge time commitment, but is a lot of fun. One of the best games to come out in the past ten years. Strongly recommended!

  I really like this game and it has become one of the top 3 games within my circle of friends! If you like Settlers of Catan, then you'll probably like the road building aspects of this game.There's certainly a luck factor involved that die hard strategists will find frustrating, but a good strategist can overcome much of the luck factor and win if they are agile enough. 5 player games become much more competitive than 2 or 3 player games.We also discovered in a recent game that you need at least two dedicated card hoarders (not building at all until late in the game) in order to lock up the entire deck, so there is plenty of playability even if one person is being a curmudgeon.The train station addition of the game also makes it much, much harder for any one person to block another's route completely, which makes for more balanced gameplay.

  Outstanding table presence and art IMO.  Our family (wife and 11 y/0 son) played twice the first night we had it.  Components are a cut above.  Very well done insert that easily accommodates all items.  Rule book is truly exceptional giving clear instruction through illustrations and a myriad of examples.  Card stock is good.  Rules are on the simpler side, but offers enough to keep coming back.  Dice rolling, while very luck driven, uses well done mechanics that can mitigate their effects through the use of acquired and applied resources (Masts, cannons).  Large tiles (6 of them) are printed on both sides and able to be changed so that the gameplay stays fresh.  Production value is wonderful with a (good) kickstarter like look without being over done and without the year wait and hope that it ships.  Feels like a passion project and I really enjoy it.  Ultra deep gameplay or rules aficionados should look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for a game that is relatively fast to the table, fun, and simple enough to attract non gamers but also offers great player interaction (threats, bribes, etc) and enough lite strategy for a veteran gamer, you will enjoy this.

  I'm always skeptical about new board games with a high price, and have been frustrated so many times to pay $30-$80 for what amounts to a piece of cardboard or a deck of cards even if the idea is solid.  Plunder (a pirate's life) finally delivers- it's the first game in forever I've bought that's actually HEAVY when it arrives.  The board is surprisingly huge, the design actually makes you feel like you're looking at ocean and ships (I'm looking at you $40 Catan seafarers- water isn't just WordArt blue and ships aren't triangles), and the gameplay backs it all up with accessible but interesting rules and mechanics.  My friends and I are only just starting to get the hang of it but I'm just so happy to actually feel like I got a game worth playing for once.

  My nephews (11yr, 15yr) enjoyed Pluder: A Pirate's Life very much. We had such a good time playing it! The younger nephew was really impressed with the game art and really liked the ship pieces. The game play instructions were clear and easy to follow. After setting up the game which took about 3 minutes or so, we were ready to play. The game includes a spinner, or in this case a compass, which nowadays not many games have. The younger nephew quickly made sure he was in charge of the spinner. After about an hour of game play, the younger nephew came out victorious! It was highly competitive as the score was very close at the end. The ""Treasure Cards"" was one of our favorite features. When reading a ""Treasure Card"" players are encourage to talk like a pirate which made everyone laugh. I really enjoyed Plunder: A Pirate's Life and I could see myself playing with both younger and older crowds. I highly recommend!

  Plunder is an absolute joy to play, and the game came in perfect condition. Rules are simple and easy to follow. However, due to what I assume is a manufacturing error, the game came with two attack dice and one defense die (rather than one attack, one defense, and one sailing). This is not that big of a problem however because the dice only really have numbers on them and I just replaced one of the two red dice given with a spare white one that I own. Overall, very fun game that I will play over and over again with friends and family.

  This game takes Catan to a whole other level. If you enjoy Catan, you will love this game. The board and game pieces are awesome. The rule book is so easy to understand and if you forget a rule as you first play, it's easy to find in the rule book. We played for the first time last night and we forgot about one rule as we were playing which we think is part of the reason it took so long to play. We are going to play again today the right way and see how long it takes. You do want to play when you have plenty of time as, like Catan, it is a long playing game. But it was so much fun the time went by quickly. This game is a lot strategy, but also luck as when you battle you are depending on the roll of the die. I have 13 and 15 year old boys. They both love the fact that you can battle in this game to try and win islands or sink ships. I really can't say enough good things about this game. We LOVE it. Oh, and best thing, since there are a lot of pieces to this game, the last page of the rule book shows you how to pack everything back up in the box.

plunder like a pirate

  ok ok nothing is better than an evening or two or three playing merchants & marauders but when youwant to stay on the same theme and have a blast, Plunder is the game.Easy to learn.Easy to play.Has some very nice touches that make it interesting for vets too.First one to 10 plunder points wins. sound familiar.player gets plunder points from owning ships, islands, and through card play.There are at least 3 treasures to find going in the game and huge storm thats changer on a roll of 1 of the sailing dice.player can fight other ships, fight and capture islands/ports on a map that changes each time you play.players can trade with other players depending on your location on the map.players can upgrade ships with more masts for extra movement, more cannons for extra combat points in battles.four sets of resource cards allow the player to 'build' the upgrades.excellent game. very surprised. i got it for my birthday. will see a lot of play time with family.

Fun Game for the beginner or advanced players
","

  The game is amazing, easy to learn yet hard to master. It is a mix of skill, planning and the luck of the dice and cards as you build up your fleets, sail around the map conquering islands, searching for treasure, gathering resources and battling your foes.The ships and pieces are very well made and durable. Each ship starts with 3 life pawns and can be upgraded with 2 masts and 2 cannons. The parts are solid and with not easily bend or break. The spinners, map pieces, and board are the standard, as expected, punched out cardboard. The board pieces are sadly the only pieces that I am concerned with, they interlock like a puzzle and even though they are durable they are sill just cardboard with an image overlayed on them. Meaning eventually I expect the ends to wear, bend, tear or break, my heart is already sad for the day this will occur :(No two games are the same with the myriad of options to choose from. You have a grid of 6 map tiles, each map tile can be used in one of its four directions, plus there is a second side, so each tile an option of 8 different layouts. Meaning you have a total of over 200,000 ways to layout your map.You start off your meager fleet with one ship and one island. You set a course for the randomly plotted 'X's which as ye all know to be treasure! The treasure can be a blessing or a curse but well worth the risk. Slowly you gather enough resources to build up your ship or maybe add a new one to the fleet. Once you feel ready you can set a course for an unclaimed isle and make her yours. Each owned island allots you one new resource card at the start of each round.You can choose to sail with diplomacy or with the Jolly Roger as your guide. You can work out deals and treaties with foes or barrage them with your freshly installed cannons. Sink their vessels as a way to gain ""plunder"" points, the goal is to be the first to reach a predetermined amount of plunder.The biggest thing I want to really to tell you about is the game makers care for the game, the tray has a location for EVERY single piece. They even take time to give you a page in the rule book about how to store your game properly ensuring the game will last for many sessions to come.  THANK YOU Lost Boy Entertainment!

An easy, engaging, fun, and robust game - highly recommend
","

  Wow!!!What a fun and engaging game!At first, I was concerned with the lengthy rulebook, but the game mechanics are so logical that the rulebook has a natural, breezy flow.This is a great ‚Äúgateway‚Äù game with enough play variety and a cool, inviting table presence (my wife was even interested when she saw it!) and I was able to explain the rules in about 2 minutes...again, because they are so logical and thematic - the gameplay explanation flows together and just makes natural sense...All the elements work well together from the card draw, dice rolls, to the spinners - these are the ‚Äúoriginal gansta‚Äù tools of the trade that make this game familiar and inviting to non-gamers...So, I‚Äôm really trying to think of a flaw - and I guess if I get picky, I might say the Plunder Points should be some kind of plastic token piece instead of a card set...maybe add a reference card for player turn actions and battle types/outcomes but that‚Äôs all I can come up with...As for game-play improvements...again, not much to add here...what I can envision is maybe a mini-expansion...maybe there is a Navy Patrol ship with its own die that makes life harder for all players by imprisoning crew lives, taking cards away, or liberating islands from pirates (think of Catan‚Äôs robber)...maybe the game designer can offer piece upgrades like the plunder point tokens previously mentioned...but again, I‚Äôm getting picky ‚Äî the game doesn‚Äôt really need it.I would recommend this game to people who want to have fun with others playing a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù game that offers a variety of actions to win. When I played, I found I was getting points in all ways possible depending on my available resources - so I was invading islands, fighting other players, and burying treasure as well as building and upgrading my ships - all to secure my lead and win the game...This game will hit the table again - highly recommend.

Real review! Not fake to pump up the ratings...
","

  I watched this game since it first came out and have kept an eye on the reviews, as there isn't a lot of information on the game. My first impression based on the reviews quickly popping up (one 5 star after another), was that someone's family and friends were making a lot of favorable comments in support of their loved ones new game. It's great to be supportive but as a buyer I want real information. Why is the game good? How does it scale? How is the quality, length and replayability? Is it worth $50? Will kids enjoy it? Is it any good?The game concept was intriguing enough that I decided to purchase it. The components are decent. The ships are great. Excellent quality. They are a little to big for the squares on the board so if you battle it will overlap, or you have to sit on two spaces. But that is not a big deal. The cards are very thin. A deck of generic cards are better in quality. For the price, I would have liked a linen finish but I suspect all the money went into the ships. It would have also been great to have some type of coin and resource cubes in place of the plunder and resource cards. But like I said, it looks like all the money went into the ships.The game itself leaves a lot to be desired. There is not much game at all. On your turn you draw resource cards equal to the number of islands you control, roll your die, take some actions. These actions could be moving your ship/ships, finding treasure, upgrading ships, battling a player or taking over an island. Unfortunately, you find most of your turn is spent floating around place to place and spending the easy-to-come-by resources. Battles are few and far between making the game somewhat dull, even with aggressive players. This didn't change as the number of players did. Replayability just isn't there. We played through almost all the treasure cards on our first game. There is nothing new to discover.It does have a cool element in which a storm moves around the board whenever you roll a one. But pay a few resources and you are out of it. Also, the rulebook leaves some loopholes to cheat the game making it far too easy without some house rules.  IF, they did an upgrade to fix some of the broken rules and battle issues this game could be really good but for what it is and what you get (a decent board, excellent ships and cheap cards) it is not worth $50.Plunder is a good, basic, starter game in the world of pirate themed games, or board games in general. I would recommend it for those with family's and younger children who like the concept without the ""take that"" aspect. If playing with kids I would reduce the number of required plunder points. It just takes to long and gets boring. For adult gamers, or medium to heavy gamers I would give this game a pass and seek out Black Fleet (the game this little guy is trying to be) Piratology (with an end game house rule) or Skull Tales: Full Sail (the rulebook sucks but there are some great tutorials online).Easy to learn but boring.

Great, Quality Game with Easy to Learn Gameplay
","

  I stumbled upon this game while looking for board games to help to pass the time and was immediately drawn to the art style of the board and the concept of a pirate-based game. Despite never hearing of it before, it seemed reasonably priced compared to other strategy games, so I figured ""why not.""After playing this game three times the night it arrived and three more times a day later, I can safely say that this game is absolutely worth it and a blast to play, especially 1v1. The goal of the game is relatively simple - acquire enough ""Plunder Points"" to become the greatest pirate before your opponent manages the same. These points are earned through purchasing them outright with Gold resources, building ships, conquering islands, finding buried treasure, and sinking your rivals' ships as you compete with one another. The art on the board pieces and resource cards is beautiful and very stylistic, with both being well made and durable. The rules are not too complicated and easy to pick up - we only had to reference the rules once during gameplay after reviewing them before the first playthrough. The included reference cards provide a quick, easy way of managing what you can purchase with your accumulated resources such as ship upgrades - masts and cannons for more maneuverability and attack power - extra lives, additional ships, or Plunder Points. The game pieces are hardy, and all of the extra pieces fit perfectly into their designated slot. Additionally, the map tiles are reversible with alternative layouts so that you can generate a different play area for each game to allow for a different experience each time.While the objective is to gain the 10 Plunder Points, players can choose various methods to attain this goal, meaning that no two playthroughs will end up the same. In the first run, I focused on combat by sinking my opponent's ship early and finding treasure spots to chase the win. During the next game, my opponent concentrated on taking over as many islands as they could to generate more resource cards for upgrades and direct purchases of Plunder Points to secure victory. Finding treasure can result in a boon of wealth and resources, or offer less beneficial effects such as gaining gold at the loss of wood, or force swapping cards with another player. The continually moving and random path of the Storm can also help or hinder, as you can try to force your opponent into the area or become stuck yourself. Similarly, moving treasure spots ensure that everyone has a chance at finding loot, though some players may end up lucky enough to wind up with multiple treasure spots in their immediate path. Not always hostile, player interaction can also be inspired by offering bribes to avoid being attacked, or trading resource cards towards mutual benefit. Depending on playstyle, and with a bit of random luck from dice rolls, our 2-player games have lasted from 20 minutes to an hour.Plunder: A Pirate's Life is an excellent addition to any household and is absolutely worth the investment. I'm looking forward to playing more, and this will definitely be a go-to game for our home.

Easy to Learn, Solid Strategy Game with Dynamic Gameplay
","

  I played this game with four other players (5 total), and we all had a very fun time. The rules are intuitive and easy to learn. The mechanics are great. You can build multiple ships, and upgrade ships with cannons for extra damage or masts for additional movement. There is a moving storm that you do not want your ships to be caught in. You can choose to be friendly with other players by trading, striking deals or staying out of their way. You can also do what one of my friends did and sink all of another player's ships at the start of the game. Unclaimed slands can be conquered, and you can take other players' islands as well. The board is random every time!The goal is to get 10 ""Plunder Points"". Each ship and island you own counts as one Plunder Point. You can find lost treasure or save up gold to get additional Plunder Points as well.What we especially liked is how quickly the tide can turn against someone who is just one turn away from winning. Three of us got up to 9 Plunder Points at various points throughout the game until the rest of us decided to (temporarily) cooperate together to bring down the top pirate. There was also plenty of good ol' pirate backstabbing, threatening, and parlaying üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏èDefinitely a must-have if you want a solid strategy game with dynamic gameplay!

  Great game that was easy to learn. We typically play cooperative games like Horrified, Pandemic and forbidden island with our 14 year old daughter, but wanted to expand our options. Plunder is well made and really fun to play. We have played it six times in the few days we have had it. Played 2 and 3 player games, which offer a unique experience.

Plunder is fun-filled, high-quality, and swashbucklin'!
","

  Plunder: A Pirate's Life is an excellent board game to be enjoyed by everyone! There is room for both strategy enthusiasts and casual players just looking to have fun with friends. The gameplay consists of (1) sailing your pirate ships around, (2) searching for buried treasure, (3) combating other pirate ships & islands, (4) collecting resources (used to build & upgrade your fleet and to get victory points), (5) capturing islands, and (6) avoiding the ever-moving storm (all while maintaining your best pirate accent). Plunder is designed to be the most fun when you aim to play it with a pirate-like attitude/strategy, which goes to show a lot of thought has gone into the game design. That is to say, I have the most fun when I strategize to roll with what I am given, take advantage of situations as they arise, and expect an ounce of luck/chance to influence the game. In addition to the well thought out gameplay, Plunder excels in the quality of its production. All of the components are clearly well made (I especially like the weight and feel of the pirate ships) and you will notice this even in the weight of the box, which is notably heavy. The box states it takes 20 min per player for a game with 2-6 players being able to play. I have found this to be true for at least games with 2, 3, and 4 players (though I haven't played with 5 or 6 yet), with the necessary caveat that your first game will take a little longer to learn the rules.

  This game is awesome! My husband bought it by chance several months ago and we have now shown the game to all our friends many of which have bought their own sets. The quality of materials is nice and sturdy. The game itself is always changing so you must be an adaptable player who is willing to attack others to win. The only thing is that when the game has more than 4 players with several ships there are not enough life pegs to fill the boats so we have had to place canons and masts as lives in the past.

This game has far less rooms so you can play on a smaller (read: card) table if you wanted.Combat and the way damage is taken is a more simplified.Players are no longer eliminated from the game, letting people play instead of sit on the sidelines.Haunts are easier to understand and trigger, with less innane rules, and all information is shared with all players . No more Haunts that leave you scratching your head and wondering why you lost. (Though, this is optional).The material the game is made from seems to be one that won't warp as easily as the older games (YAY!)You will be able to play this with kids, easily, and anyone who is a fan of Scooby-Doo will have a blast, every rule/action is explained clearly and a lot of the vague undertones of the first game are gone.CONSThere are less room tiles in total (25), but this lines up with the PRO of needing a smaller space. Personally, I don't consider this a con, but some might.OVERALL:If you or anyone you know is a fan of any of the Betrayal games, then you can't go wrong with this one. It's a tighter, faster version of Betrayal that anyone can pick up or join in on. If they're a Scooby Doo fan, then it's a given that this would be a fantastic gift.

Meant for kids. Not adults.
","

  110% meant for kids. I've played all of the previous Betrayal games & this one is very much meant for non-gamers and kids. I do think they'd like it - but I don't think gamers who don't have kids will like it. They ripped apart the rules to be significantly more basic - we jumped straight to ""hard"" mode and beat it with literally 0 issues. Mega skewed towards the heros. Good for nostalgia if you like Scooby Do. Good for kids. Not great for adults who frequently play board games. Played the hard haunts and will probably never play again.

Great Theme, Wish Component Quality Was Better

  This is a great re theme of the original BHOTH.  My family really enjoys Scooby Doo, so this was a no brainer especially with kiddos.I enjoy:-The simplified rules format-Artwork is awesome-Smaller box than BHOTHWhat I wish was improved:-Cardboard stock used for all the punch outs was very thin-Punch quality was dicey ... removing these pieces should not be this difficult (maybe just my copy?)-The trait clips will eventually wear away the edges of the character cards ... I wish AH came up with a different mechanism for tracking this-I wish there were miniatures instead of the standeesFor the price, these things that should have been improved should have been a given.  Oh well. The IP for this game probably wasn‚Äôt cheap, lol.Still a great game, and lots of fun!

  I don‚Äôt know how this game got such high ratings. My husband and I didn‚Äôt understand it at all. It‚Äôs so confusing! I don‚Äôt know how anyone could possibly enjoy this game. It‚Äôs insanely complicated! Also, why on earth would any game that was supposed to be fun require you to have three books just to play it? We were hoping this would be a variation of clue but more ‚ÄúScooby-ish‚Äù and instead it was a giant pile of insanity. Worse yet, we can‚Äôt return it because it has so many pop out pieces which we obviously can‚Äôt put back.

  As someone who has never played the original Betrayal game, this was super easy to learn and play with my wife, 11-year-old, and 9-year-old. Despite being really accessible, there is still a lot of depth and variety to the gameplay. Might eventually pick up the original base game after getting used to this one. Only complaint is that the stat tracking clips are very difficult to attach and slide on the character cards and have already started tearing them a bit after one round of gameplay.

  This is another super fun game to play with the family. We are all about co-op play or new strategy games and this checked most of the boxes. We‚Äôve never played any other betrayal games but we were Scooby fans looking for a new family game.It will take one or two plays to fully get the rules down without relying on the rule book constantly (and the rules can be tweaked for more advanced play!) We look forward to trying one of the other betrayal games with adults in the future.It does come with 3 books; the rule book alone is 12 pages. Don‚Äôt read the Haunts or Tome book or you‚Äôll ruin the fun! We‚Äôve played this upward of a dozen times with friends and then just us the 4 of us. Our 7 year old even enjoys it - with help. It does seem very difficult for the monster to win.

Good entry level game for younger players.
","

  After 3 plays, I really wanted to enjoy this game but the haunts seem to fall flat.The rules have been simplified to make it easier for children to access it but I think the rulebook is kind of a mess. For such a simple game, I had a hard time finding certain rules which slowed down play.I played this with my kids, but the youngest is 18 and all are used to meatier games, so I'm not sure how children will enjoy it. If they get a good teaching of the rules, I feel like children will enjoy it.The way in which haunts are generated in this game weakens the replayability compared to earlier versions. Also, the haunts seemed to fall flat for our crew. (Which can happen in any game of Betrayal, but seem to happen more often here.)I enjoyed the way the Scooby Gang characters played out. Thematically, they were on point.This game feel like an entry level game that you get new players into for a relatively quick play and then quickly get them to other games. For the price, it is worth picking up to have in your collection, but for me I'd rather play a round of Betrayal at Balder's Gate.

  I bought this thinking it would be aimed at adults.  I was wrong.  It's more of an intro-to-betrayal game.  Which is useful if you want to play with children.  My adult game group was not very impressed with this game as it's stripped down and streamlined to a degree that makes the game feel rushed. The theme is great and I believe had they made this more akin to it's predecessor and less as an introductory game it would have been a better game.  Overall buy it if you have kids.  Otherwise skip it as the Scooby theme alone does not save it.

  Love the game but the markers to track the brains/speed etc that are constantly moved throughout the game are a horrible design, difficult to move and tear up the cardboard pictures they are on. Also he drives me nuts when a big game like this doesn't do a good job on organization for all the small tokens. My little scythe is a fabulous job of this this one just has me dumping a ton of different little parts into a big storage square. Both of these factors make us not want to get it out.

Fun Co-Op Deck-Building Game featuring Harry Potter Characters!
","

  Just a quick little spoiler-free review to say my husband and I love to play Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle!I saw it at our local game store and thought it was a gimmick at first -- just another way to make money off a much-loved franchise -- but then I read the back description.  Our favorite tabletop games are co-op (Forbidden Island/Desert, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Mansions of Madness, Time Stories, etc.), and we also enjoy card/deck-building games (Dominion, Legendary games, etc.), plus I love the Harry Potter series (my husband is okay with it), so we took a chance and bought it.  We now play it every night after we come home from work!The gameplay reminds me of Dominion mixed with any Legendary game, but more fun because you play as specific characters -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, and/or Neville -- and battle though seven increasingly difficult ""games"", each representing a book/movie in the series.  Each game has a set of Locations, Dark Arts, Villains, Hogwarts cards, and other components, such as dice or upgraded character cards.  Beat Game 1, then add Game 1 cards to Game 2.  Beat Game 2, then add Game 1 AND 2 cards to Game 3, etc.  This is a 2-4 player game, so for a two-player game, I recommend each person play two characters to get the full experience.  My husband plays Ron and Harry, and I play Hermione and Neville.The basic premise is to work together to protect Locations from Villain Control and defeat all the Villains.  You lose if all Locations fall to Villain Control, but you win if you defeat all Villains.  Dark Arts and Villain abilities will hurt and hinder characters every step of the way, so building a strong deck of Hogwarts cards and playing to your characters abilities is essential.  The first two games are warm-ups, then the real difficulty kicks in on Game 3.  By then, your characters WILL get ""stunned"" (lose all health) at least once per game.  But that doesn't mean the fun is over, you just take penalties and keep on fighting, so you don't have to worry about someone sitting out of the game and waiting for everyone else to win.In terms of production, this game is the highest quality of all of our tabletop games.  Everything is in full color.  Each Game is individually boxed, and each set of Location, Dark Arts, etc. cards inside are sleeved separately to avoid confusion.  All cards are clearly marked by Game number or the character they belong to if they're starting cards.  In addition to the easy-to-understand 14-page instruction book, each Game has it's own little instruction booklet to easily guide players into setting up the next game and refreshing everyone on rules.  The cards are smooth and feature fantastic art from the movies.  All the cardboard tokens and components are sturdy and already cut out (except Game-specific tokens), and there are even cool metal skull tokens and four beautiful, clear Hogwarts House die inside.  The game box itself is sectioned logically for each game component and even leaves extra space if you want to sleeve your Hogwarts cards.I highly recommend this for anyone who likes co-op tabletop games, deck-building games, and/or the Harry Potter series!

They got it right!  Definitely earned an ""O"" on their N.E.W.T.'s!

  I hesitated to buy this game because I've been disappointed in Harry Potter games in the past.  They seemed to rely on the HP theme and didn't put enough effort into actual game play.  I'm happy to say that USAopoly and Forrest-Pruzan Creative have knocked it out of the park!  Or ""castle,"" if you want to go there.This is a cooperative deck building game that has 7 Games that build on each other.  Kind of a neat concept.  (I'm not talking about expansions you have to purchase - everything is included in the box.)  You and the other players play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Nevile.  The object is to defeat the villians (Draco, Quirrel, Lucius, etc.) before the villians take over all your locations. That's the object of the first 2 Games, at least.  Because, just like the novels, this game builds on itself 7 times.  Game 1 is complete in and of itself, but adding the material of another Game box will change it in certain ways.  One of the Game boxes add dice...to a deck building game that starts with no dice.  I can't wait to get there!The board, cards, and tokens are all very good quality. Nothing is flimsy or wanting. The Dark Mark tokens are stellar.  Molded in metal, they have a heavy weight and definitely add to the ""wow!"" factor with this game.  After you play each Game box, the cards can be separated out again, or left together by type.  (Game 1 has 2 villians, Game 2 adds 3 more, etc.)  The game developers thought ahead and even gave us organizer cards if you want to keep everything all mixed together (all the villians together, all the Dark Art Events together, etc.) once you've cracked the box and moved up the Game ladder.Because of the Game 1-7 add-on feature, this is an excellent intro to Eurogames.  It starts off really simple but ramps up after you get used to the mechanics.  One of the great perks is that if you have kids just now reading the books, you can play this game with them up to and including the Game box for the corresponding book.  That way it's completely relevant to them and nothing is given away for the later books.Harry Potter is very special to me for personal reasons that go back to 1997.  I was an original fan.  My hat is off to the developers for creating a solid, enjoyable game for diehard fans!

Well produced and thematically-enriched deck building game
","

  *Important notice for people purchasing the early first runs of this game. There was a printing error which lead to 4 copies of a card called Confundus being put into the box (2 in box 5 and 2 in box 6 I think). The two Confundus! cards in box 5 were supposed to be two copies of Stupefy! which are missing from some peoples game, including my own. You can contact USAopoly customer service to get replacement cards:usaopoly.com/game-care-customer-service-inquiryThis is a highly entertaining game that was well worth the purchase and should be enjoyed for some time to come. I've played with just two and multiple games in groups of four and it's entertaining with both.As a quick summary -  I enjoy deck builders and this is a solid addition to our collection. If you like deck builders, particularly co-operative ones like Legendary Encounters: ALIENS, and enjoy Harry Potter this seems like an inevitable purchase. It also works as an easy way to introduce people to deck building mechanics which should work nicely for families, just be wary of small spoilers for children that haven't read through the books yet.For a more detailed breakdown of my thoughts so far:-The game evolves as you play through the chapters/games. The game has a built in tutorial for the first few games where it introduces you to the general mechanics of deck builders and the basics of this particular game. As you progress through each chapter you essentially continue to add more villains, more purchasable cards and more Dark Arts Events. If you're familiar with deck builders or are a savvy bunch you could easily start on game 4 or 5. The cards are all marked for which game they belong to so that if, at any point, you want to reset the game back you can easily do so. Game 7 represents the ultimate full form of the game with the full complement of villains, Dark Arts Events cards and the couple other unique features introduced throughout the entire series including game 7.-The game will get longer as you progress through chapters. You continue to add in villains with each chapter meaning the number of villains that you need to defeat is also increased. People have suggested on Board Game Geek that it plateaus out at about 1.5-1.75 hours with the very first game maybe being half an hour.-It both does and does not follow the events of the books and movies. As you progress through chapters it will introduce villains and Dark Arts Events from the Harry Potter series. However the game doesn't really try to tell a story and most of the villains don't come up in order. As a result it doesn't really give away major pieces of the plot. Regardless if you have a child that is reading through the books currently the best suggestion would be to only play through the games that they have read up to (game 1 matching roughly to book 1) mainly so they can relate to the villains and Events that occur. If you want to play beyond that point you can also look through the cards and maybe just remove those cards that you think might give too much away.-The game tends to be a bit harder with 4 people than with 2. Some of the Events and villains affect all characters simultaneously which makes the game slightly harder for a full group. I think overall it balances well for two players still since you also have less hero powers to make use of. It may not be the most difficult co-operative game out there, but make no mistake, the game can kick your butt pretty well depending on the villain order. You need to carefully balance damage output, heals and removing villain influence.-There is no player elimination. I don't like player elimination, especially for semi-long games. This game handles that aspect nicely, there are still health pools to track for the characters but when you hit zero you aren't eliminated. Instead you discard some cards for that turn and it helps the villains, but you are not eliminated. You bounce back to full health for the next turn. If everyone keeps getting stunned every other turn, however, you will lose. So you still need to be careful-Production quality is quite good. The pieces are all well done. The theme flows through all the cards and pieces. Overall the game mechanics, theme and cards just simply work. Very nice box and board. It feels like the designers are true fan of the series-Several groups of friends already want to play this game just from seeing a picture posted online. It has that excitement factor just looking at the game, which I think is a huge plus.-Setup and game play is quick. You can set up a game in under 10 minutes and get going. Turns tend to be straightforward and are quick to resolve.The game is easy to teach. The rules are easy to understand and everything is basically explained on the cards themselves. This helps immensely with teaching the game and being able to just play rather than making sure you have all the rules just right before each turn. This is a fantastic gateway game since you can modify the difficulty level while still introducing some major designer game concepts (like deck building) to a group. The co-operative nature of the game means you can actually help other players without ruining the game.So should you buy it?If you already own a ton of designer board games (Think like 20+ especially deck builders or maybe cooperative games). You may not get a ton out of this particular game unless you want/need the Harry Potter theme or if the game mechanics are drastically different from anything you already own. I think this game does what it does well, but nothing is especially groundbreaking. For these people that already own a lot of games I'd suggest waiting to see online plays or for reviews to come out from your favorite reviewers before purchasing. Rahdo has a nice run through of this game and Dice Tower has also covered it just to name a coupleFor those that have more limited designer game collections. Are you looking to try out (or think you might like) cooperative board games? Are you looking for a good introduction to deck building games? Do you love the Harry Potter universe or have family members that do? If you answer yes to all of these it's an obvious purchase. If you answer yes to even one it's also probably a great purchase.I bought it because I love cooperative games and there are limited cooperative deckbuilders. For me and my relatively small collection of games it ranks right up there along with my other cooperatives like Pandemic and Ghost Stories in terms of fun. It probably doesn't have the huge replay value of a game like Pandemic, but it also doesn't need to. I'm exceedingly happy with my purchase and the significant other is too, and that's all I really care about.

So this game is pretty fun, but suffers from some balance issues
","

  So this game is pretty fun, but suffers from some balance issues, I think. The game itself is actually divided into 7 different games, which follow the 7 books. Each game you get to play as one of the main characters of the book and all players work together to try and win. You play the games sequentially and the cards and characters follow the books thematically as you progress. Each new game adds new cards and gameplay elements that progressively make it harder and more complex. That part is pretty fun and the pieces are well crafted and fun to look at and handle.We found a couple problems playing through with 2 players - the first 6 games are way too easy. We felt like we were just going through the motions and never actually felt like we were ever in danger of losing. It wasn't that it was a bad game, there just was no tension or threat that you need to make a cooperative game interesting. Once we got to game 7 though, it did feel like it got harder, but honestly we still won with relative ease.So, we suspected that part of the reason the game was so easy was that we only had two players. So when we had the chance, we had a couple friends play with us, using all the pieces for game 6. We got absolutely destroyed, with not even a chance of winning. The problem was that on other player's turns your character can be negatively affected. With only one other player there's not really that big of an impact. With 3 other players you get absolutely destroyed every turn with all the negative things that accumulate. This seems like a huge balance issue in the game to me.Overall if you're looking for a nicely themed game with good production value, I'd say this is a good game for you. If you're more interested in challenging gameplay with sound mechanics, it might take some time to find the right balance, but may be worth the effort.

Best Harry Potter game ever and can hold its own with the majority of deck building games
","

  If you are a deck building expert you may find the game play is not as good as the best deck building games but it is a very good deck building game.  If you are new to deck building games this is a terrific introduction with a seven step system that has a really easy entry point for books 1 and 2.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and even a casual gamer this is a must have.  In terms of implementing the theme of the series it is incredible.  The cooperative nature allows for a group of varying skill levels to enjoy the evening.  We play as a family with a non-gamer wife and gamer boys 8 and 10.  We have played it around 15 times though now we only play it as game 7 with all the bells and whistles.  I took it to my local wargaming club and they enjoyed it. Which is amazing as they hate cooperatives!  The games do often turn into runaway defeats or victories but I believe that is the nature of the designer choices which heavily favor random as opposed to scripted adventures.  There are many house rules you can pick and choose from Boardgamegeek to adjust the difficulty of the game or minimize the chances of a runaway. The game system is solid and so many of the best parts of the book show up it was addictive and bedtime was banished for a couple of weeks.  I really love that you add a little each game.  Very much a christmas morning feeling opening games 3 through 7. We paid about 40 bucks. One of the best gaming values in my 35 years of gaming. If you have any interest in designing a game for your favorite subject there are great lessons to be learned here.  I can't believe this was produced by a relatively unknown company, they punched way above their weight.

A suprisingly fun game, even for adults.
","

  This game is a deck builder that uses an ""Ascension-style"" card market (where the cards change every time one is bought), rather than a ""Dominion-style"" market (where the cards market is determined at the beginning of the game and doesn't change). If you're familiar with just about any deck builders, you'll be able to pick up on this game pretty easily. You start the setup by picking a character (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville), each of which has a unique starting deck, and opening the small box that contains the cards for the game you are about to play.This game plays out in 7 ""books"", each of which are contained in their own card box within the big box. Each book is a single game. When you successfully complete a game by defeating whatever villains come with that book, you can open the next card box which slightly changes the game by 1.) adding or changing the villains, 2.) adding or changing the environments, 3.) adding to the types of bad events that can occur, 4.) adding more complex cards to the market, and 5.) changing the powers of the characters.The game isn't strictly a legacy game in that you mark up the board or rip up cards, but it does build upon itself from game to game. However, when you complete a book (which takes less than an hour, early games are less than 30 minutes), you can pack up the game for another time, or continue with the scenario right away. This makes the game perfect for squeezing in one quick scenario before bedtime without committing to 2 hours of play. It's easy to play previous scenarios again, if you so desire.As far as collaboration goes, the game is cooperative, but the actual collaboration is limited to helping a fellow player heal (you WILL take damage in this game from the bad guys) or helping them get a little extra money to buy cards on their turn, but these are mostly rare events, and only if you draw the correct card on your turn. Otherwise, most of the collaboration is in the form of table-talk. I wish it had a bit more interaction, but that would have complicated the otherwise simple and fun mechanics.

","

  This is a really well-designed game that should appeal to players young and old. My wife and I prefer cooperative games and this has quickly become a favorite. The game system works really well and is easy to understand with game mechanics introduced over the series of 7 years that you play. You will encounter all of your favorite characters and items during the game and quickly come to hate the villains even more (you'll shudder when Bellatrix LeStrange or Fenrir Grayback appear. Not because they are evil, but because they are so difficult from a game mechanic basis).The game proceeds through 7 years each one a slightly more complex game. An important detail to note is that there is no continuity from game to game. You don't retain any abilities won from one year to the next. This is probably the thing most of our friends have commented on while playing.The game also does suffer a tiny bit from two problems. The wrong deal of starting villains can be impossible to beat and the only choice is to lose and start over. The second problem is that you build abilities by buying cards from a market. The market deal is random and it may start out as too expensive for anyone to buy anything and doom the players (there's even a creator suggested alternate rule to deal with this). However, these are minor problems in a great game (though we are busily working on house rules to introduce a way for players to hang on to improved abilities from game to game).The final point that I will mention is the actual cards and game pieces. They are a weird mix of extremely high-quality and junk. The ""stones"" are very nice metal pieces and the board is really well made. Other pieces share this quality. However, the ""galleon"" markers are junk and look really cheap (I'm searching for good quality galleons to buy right now to replace them). The biggest offender is the cards themselves. We've played through the game 3-4 full cycles (so that's 20-30 games) and the cards started to show serious wear on the edges during the first cycle of games. The printing is coming off the edges of most all of them. It's the most disappointing thing about the set.We would still recommend this to anyone who likes cooperative games (Harry Potter fan or not). It's very enjoyable and very replayable. It's a must buy.

My Game Arrived Incomplete
","

  This looks like a fun game, but unfortunately, the first set of game cards (to play the first game) did not come with the set.  Instead I received 2 copies of the Game 2 cards (Game 1 box had Game 2 Cards in it).  As you build off the first game to play the remaining games, my set is unplayable as it is.  I got it as a gift for my son and we opened it after the return window.  I'll be happy to change the review if the manufacturer can reach out to me to replace the missing Game 1 cards.

Surprisingly Solid Licensed Game: Great for Novices and Experts, Especially Harry Potter Fans
","

  Bought this for my fiancee, as she's a huge Harry Potter fan, but not nearly as much into board games as I am, and I thought the co-operative, increasing difficulty might be a good hook for her.I was right. The game slowly eases into its rhythm, with seven different modules, each of which introduces new villains and attacks, as well as new spells with which to fend them off. There are new mechanics, too, with each of the four main heroes (Ron, Harry, Hermoine, Neville) ""growing up"" and getting personalized abilities in Game Three, and then learning proficiencies from their O.W.L. exams as of Game Six. Voldemort starts showing up as a rival around Game Five, and the number of villains and Dark Arts to contend with at once keeps increasing.Throughout all of this, the production design is outstanding, from the way the instruction booklet has slots to accommodate the ""new"" rules for each new ""year"" (game), to the actual tokens, from the ones that mark petrified foes and the weighty iron baubles that show how much of a locale enemies control. Movie fans will also appreciate that the familiar likenesses of these characters have been used for the art.The one issue I have with all of this, and where I have to dock a point, is with regards to the balancing of the game. It's meant for two to four players, but doesn't really scale: some of the cards and proficiencies that have effects applying to all characters seem underwhelming in a two-player game, and some of the enemy attacks are too powerful in a four-player game, in which you may constantly get stunned before getting a chance to take a turn. Randomness is a point of games like these, but certain enemy combinations are particularly frustrating (say, dealing with Lucius's ability to heal each time a location is attacked along with Pettigrew's odds of hitting a location). Moreover, with only six cards visible at once, all of which may be maddeningly out or your price range, you simply might not be able to ever mount a plausible defense. The game is largely nail-biting when it works, which is good, but you might need to add a few mulligan-like house rules of your own to keep things playable, especially with younger children.All in all, though, there's at least twenty hours of replay value in this box, and kudos to the developers for making it so easy to pack back up, with individual slots for the dice and dividers for each of the different types of cards. And while the deck building might be a bit frustrating (there's no way to get rid of outdated cards so as to streamline your deck for the endgame), and the meta-game might be a little cheap (leave the least harmful enemies in play all the way to the end), it's a great primer for newcomers, and a terrific opportunity for experts to share their passions in an enjoyable Harry Potter environment.

Solid, well-designed game which hits its target (Harry Potter fans that like teamwork and strategic deck building)
","

  This addition to my board game collection was with lower expectations, but it leaped over all of them and is a keeper.  However, I can see where there are limitations to its appeal.PROS:  solid introduction to deck building mechanic, approachable game for young players, good connection for spells and items, strategy and planning make a difference, cooperative (very important in my family!), a sense of progression through the years as the character cards get older and get a special ability, good Harry Potter world ""feel""CONS:  mediocre card quality (sleeves needed if seeing more play time than one playthrough/year), limited key characters (only Ron, Hermoine, Harry and Neville) and my daughter would have liked to have the option of other houses, slow start each year as people build their decks (would be nice to provide a ""carryover"" spell from a previous year, especially if you do very well), villains repeat from year to year, and some downtime between turns especially with more than 2 players.While I'm not a board game fanatic, I am definitely a board game player with an affinity toward games with strategy and theme--Lord of the Rings Living Card Game (sleeves fit this game) is what dragged me kicking and screaming into the hobby.  I have experience building decks, so this was an easy learn.  I would have skipped years 1 and 2 but it was my daughter's first time playing a deck builder.  She picked it up quickly and loved the game (I would rate her a 4 out of 5 Harry Potter fan).Overall, this is a must buy if you are into medium weight board games (or like deck builders) and a Harry Potter fan.  If they have expansions (with other heroes from other houses), I would buy them.  However, if you already have a good deck building game, this will NOT oust it unless you like the cooperative bent or the theme.

  I was nervous at first about this game because I thought it was just another gimmick to make money under the Harry Potter franchise, but no, it is one of the most well thought out games we‚Äôve ever played.  It says for ages 11+, but my almost 8 year old has no trouble keeping up.From start to finish the game is so packed with awesome details and quality game pieces.  We play it almost every night.  My husband is not a big Harry Potter fan like me, but he really likes the game.  And my son would rather play this than watch tv or play his video games, so it HAS to be pretty interesting.I‚Äôm already in the process of ordering the expansion.  Honestly, I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this game, it is truly great.And FYI, I wasn‚Äôt paid or compensated for this review.  I‚Äôm just a mom who wanted a new board game for our little family to play other than the typical board games out there.  This one delivers.

I liked the price
","

  I bought this game as a Christmas gift for my family because my boys grew up reading and loving Harry Potter.  I liked the price, and I liked the reviews.  I cannot begin to tell you how much we enjoy playing this game together!  I had never played a deck building game before, but now I'm hooked.  There are various game levels that become increasingly difficult to defeat.  The more we play, the better we become and developing a strategy for each player.  We work well together and have even developed a strategy for the types of cards each player should try to add to his/her deck.  Every time we play, we have a different experience.  Although my kids are older (22 and 25), I think kids as young as 10-12 could easily play this game once they understand the rules of play.I was not much of a game board player before we found this game.  Since then, we have been steadily adding games to our collection.  This game remains one of our very favorites to play.

First real venture into co op board games.
","

  Huge Harry Potter fan so seeing this pop up peaked my interest. I watched some videos and learned about the world of co op board games. Honestly my whole life board games to me were monopoly or trouble. So this has introduced me to a new aspect I never knew about. Everything is beautiful made and the game is fairly well put together. It has a progressive learning curve so you‚Äôre not thrust into a ton of rules from the get go. It‚Äôs kind of a learn as you go. The only complaint I have is I really wish this wasn‚Äôt the movie art and could have been the book art but alas it is what it is. If it was this would have been six stars for me. I really like how it‚Äôs set up into seven games and the way it all works you can kinda pick up wherever. Unless you‚Äôre going long haul you probably won‚Äôt do all seven in one go. So there‚Äôs a lot of playtime here. Overall highly recommend.Little update to the review:After quite a few times playing. We have realized a few things. First off the game is not perfect. If your starting villains have a effects that happen to trigger each other you have to stop and reshuffle. Second if your starting buy cards are all either expensive or not useful for starting game you have to reshuffle and start over. Third is you first few darkarts events cause you to lose the first location before beating any villains. Again reshuffle. It is absolutely impossible to win the game if your initial setup is triggering and your losing health and gaining locations tokens fast. That‚Äôs about the only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù we‚Äôve come to find. It‚Äôs a matter of recognizing quickly that ‚Äúyea we‚Äôre screwed‚Äù before trying to progress. Trust me you‚Äôll just waste 40 mins of the inevitable. But if you get a good setup to start, then the game is great. It‚Äôll have a bunch of ups and downs and stressful moments. You still will lose but at least you had a shot.One thing my wife and I have also learned is that Harry is easily the worst of the four. If you‚Äôre not playing 4 players don‚Äôt use him. The others effects are much better. Also while this makes the game take much longer we have found that if you use hermione to buy up a bunch of location token removals and give her the added effect to remove locations you can pretty much win every game. This strategy worked great in game 7. Again though this is the slower route but has a higher success.Overall after playing this a bunch of times now through each game, it has its flaws. It‚Äôs not a perfect strategy game as the randomness of the event cards easily upends that. But it‚Äôs alot of fun. You‚Äôll probably lose half the games you play but it makes the ones you win that much better.

Excellent deck-building Co-Op - a few minor nuisances though
","

  This game is a wonderful deck-building co-op game!Pros:- There are 4 character cards and enough proficiency cards that will randomize the game and add a level of difficulty.- Due to the shuffling of villain/dark arts cards, it's a different battle each game you play- The game builds on itself - great for beginner players to start on lower levels and work up to 7.  For those that understand deck-building, it was fun to go from 4-7.- Great balance between Villain effects and the reward for defeating a Villain.- Decent replay value - I've played 30 times and it's still fun as long as you randomize your starter character/proficiency cards.Cons:- The rule book doesn't cover some common questions:  Q: If you have a Weasley Hero card and another person is playing as Ron, does his starter deck count as having a 'Weasley'?  Q: If you play a card from you 5-card hand and it goes into the 'discard pile', and you get to pick a card from your discard, can you pick what you have played that turn?  Q: Does the Death Eater affect you as he initially comes out and/or does he affect you if he's the first Villain and two others come out?  Q: Are you allowed to discard a card in your hand in order to avoid the effects of horcruxes/Villains (eg: You have an Ally and the horcrux says that if you ""play an Ally..."")- You're hamstringed on 3 critical components of the game:  1. ***If the 6 starting (and subsequent) cards that come out for purchase don't contain 'remove from location', are too expensive (6/7/8 coins), or don't have 'dice-rolls', you can be off to a rough start. ***EDIT - the game developer released an optional rule starting that: ""Once per game, a player may forego acquiring any cards for his or her turn. If he or she does, take ALL SIX available HOGWARTS cards, and place them on the bottom of the deck, replacing them with six new cards"". This rule applies collectively to all players. So any one player can do this action ONCE per game. if a player chooses this option, no one else can repeat it until the next game""***  2. If the 3 Villains that come out initially work off of each other (can't gain heart, lose 2 heart, and if you add to location, lose 2 heart) you can be off to a horrid start.  3. Dice rolls - if you don't like relying on dice rolls, you'll need to in the later 'levels'.  If any of these happen to you, there's a great chance you'll lose.  In the games' defense, losing a co-op game is part of the fun/challenge.  Additionally, if any of these happen, the 1-hour game could turn into 3-hours.I know it looks like a laundry list of complaints, but very fun game and I'm looking forward to the expansion in August 2017.

Perfect for board game fans & Harry Potter fans
","

  My family plays a lot of board games and we are all Harry Potter fans, especially my daughter.  Once I began my search for a Harry Potter-themed game I came across all the usual franchise-money-grabs.  Just as I was losing hope I came across this game.  The reviews sold it for me.  This game is amazing; it‚Äôs not just some quickly made game to turn a buck or a previously released game wrapped in Harry Potter robes.  It‚Äôs a legit good game.  The game is difficult enough to keep us on the edge thinking we will lose but the tide always turns by the end.It is a co-op game where the players work together to defend Hogwarts against the Dark Arts using a clever drafting system.  The first time we only played Game 1.  I thought it was too simple and was having second thoughts on my purchase but I was happy my daughter liked the game.  The next night we played, we only stopped because it was getting too late.  The genius of the game is how each ‚Äòlevel‚Äô or Game increases in difficulty and complexity.  New cards (spells, items, and allies), villains, and locations are introduced as well as new elements like dice and upgraded characters.The box is designed to hold the cards in an organized fashion after each box has been open.  To play through a previous level/game all you have to do is a little sorting.  Since I have played it mostly with my daughter we have gone back to play the other levels with the rest of the family.My only complaint is I wish there were more characters to choose from.  In this game, you choose between Harry, Ron, Herminie, and Neville.  The expansion includes Luna so I‚Äôll be picking that up.I haven‚Äôt tried yet but I think this game would be fun played solo as well.

Obsessed With This Game
","

  I have an obsession with this game. I am a big fan of strategy board games, and this is probably my favorite right now. When I want to introduce it to my other nerdy board-gaming friends, I describe it as a mix of Pandemic and Dominion.Pros:-Cooperative (everyone wins or everyone loses)-Has different levels and ways to make it more or less challenging. My husband and I play it together, or with friends on the harder levels. We play it with our kids (ages 8 and 6) on the easier levels.-My emerging reader can even play it to some extent because it is cooperative. He has his cards out on display, and we can tell him what to do. This doesn't work as well with games where we are competing. It works great for a cooperative game.-There are so many variations on each game, depending on which villains you play against first, which cards are available to build your deck with, etc.Cons:-Instructions are not incredibly detailed, so there are a lot of things that we just have to just make our own house-rules about.-Setting it up and putting it away can be time-consuming because there are so many parts.-It takes a while to learn to play it well enough to do so quickly. It is not a game I teach to many friends because the learning-curve is a fairly steep one.

SUCH a GREAT game!!!
","

  I had been looking at this game for a while, but I wasn't sure if it would be very fun or have high replay value. I had doubts if a game that was so steeped in branding could be worthwhile. We own a LOT of board games, and enjoy a large variety (Catan, Clank, Ticket to Ride, Kingsburg, Above and Below, Galaxy Trucker, Killer Bunnies, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Terra Mystica, Dominion, etc), so we have a pretty high standard for what is fun. I read lots of reviews, watched a play-through, and still couldn't decide. I ended up getting it for Mother's Day (#SayNoToFlowers), and it has been SO fun!! I played through the whole thing (plus the expansion) with my husband, and we love it!!! This is a pretty straight-forward deck-builder, but with the added geekiness of Harry Potter!! It has seven boxes inside containing cards and other pieces for at least seven separate games, and *accurately follows the seven Harry Potter books, while using photos from the movies (*exceptions include a villain card of Malfoy in the first box that shows Malfoy much older than in the first movie- there are a few cards like that). The game adds elements that make sense which each new box, the characters you use improve, and it's gets harder to beat the game. I love cooperative play and deck building and HARRY POTTER so this game is a no-brainer favorite for me! The added bonus is that my husband likes it just as much (he said it's better than Marvel Legendary) so we will be playing it often!! (Unlike Clue...*sniff*) We both have favorite characters to be (him: Neville; me: Ron) Some of the levels took multiple times to beat. It's a great two or three player game (we haven't played with four people). The other great thing is that my nine year old can play with me (only through the books she has read, because there are some spoilers) and it was easy for her to learn. Now that we have opened every box, there are some suggested ways to mix up the game, as well as ways to make it harder, if you want, so there is infinite value in replay! Oh, and the game includes a system to sort the cards as well as space to keep them all organized in the box! GREAT game!!!

Fantastic game and excellent customer service
","

  My husband and I love this game.  It's engaging and practically begs to be played.  We have lost a couple times, but that hasn't been a deterrent to playing.  The game play is simple in the first games and gradually adds on more complicated elements as you advance.  This is nice in that, not only does it follow the idea of you gaining in wizardry power through the years, but also it makes the game easy to learn.  I like that I can find a youtube video on how to play a game if I have trouble following the rule book, but it's nice that I didn't have to do that with this game.  The instructions were well-explained and the game is set up in a way that didn't make me feel like I needed to revisit calculus.  Basically, it's a good game without seeming unnecessarily complicated.After we played game 4, I realized that our game 5 Dark Events cards were missing.  I shot an email to the company and received an envelope in the mail with the missing cards just four days later, with a bonus card included as an apology.  Any company that will assist their customers so quickly is one I want to buy from again.

Lots of fun, some complexity, game made mostly of great quality materials.
","

  So far we've only played 2 of the 7 games included (each game includes extra cards, mostly to be mixed with the cards of the previous game), but this has already been great fun. I feel like setup (especially first-time) is a little tedious and the cards come in an insane number of small bags (this is to help you sort them for the first game at least, so, don't do what I did and just shuffle them all together or you'll have to sort them out by hand). There are probably 10 different subsets of cards (they are all labeled, just takes a bit of getting used to).Once you get rolling, the gameplay is fairly quick. You'll probably want to play more than one round, though, so you can take advantage of being already set up. Being a co-op game it's great for kids, everybody gets to be on the same side and the ""forces of darkness"" are symbolized by a few villain character-cards and some nasty spell cards.So far the game seems very true to the movies (no spoilers). My daughter is very into the lore and pointed out that, even though there are 7 games (supposedly following the 7 books) some characters who don't make it through the first book will still be in play in game 2. She also noticed that some of the photos for the game 2 cards are taken from later movies. This didn't harm the gameplay at all, and didn't upset her much, just required a tad more suspension of disbelief.The bad guys damage the heroes and take over locations (cards with nice screengrabs from the movies) through spells that they cast each turn (also cards with movie-quality pictures). The heroes (the 2-4 players) play Harry, Hermione, Ron, or Neville. Players track health using cardboard tokens on a track, and the villains track their control of the locations using small but fairly hefty metal tokens. Players build abilities by purchasing spell and item cards with cardboard ""influence"" tokens.Almost all the characters from the movies are in the game, all as photos of the original actors, so, everyone can be righteously on guard when, say, Lucius Malfoy's card turns up, or happy when Trevor or Crookshanks dispatches a foe. Another big part of the fun is imagining yourself casting spells. There are lots of fun ones (although, for some reason, the game is chock full of comparatively unexciting Alohomora (unlocking) spells). If you or your kids aren't into the books or movies, then the game will seem less fun. Also, the villains use the same ""dark mark"" skull symbols as shown in the movie and a certain dude-who-must-not-be-named is pictured in full bad-guy makeup, so if your kids are young enough to be scared by that, you might want to wait on getting this game. (For that matter, the metal tokens are easy to swallow and the game is all about magic spells (some of which wound characters, though there are no graphics of this), so there are plenty of reasons to keep young kids at a safe distance.)The look and feel of all the cards is great. I wish the tokens were all metal, stone, or a nice plastic, and I wish the few which are metal were of a more interesting shape, but those are very minor gripes. All-in-all, its a great game for game night with your Harry Potter fans.

  So addicting! It takes a round or 2 to really understand how to play but then it becomes hard to quit and put it away! We bought this for our 9 yo son. He loves it but my husband and I are totally hooked, too. While most enjoyable for Potter fans, you don't need any knowledge about the series to play this. We love the cooperative aspect of it. Win as a team or go down as a team. Take note that it is not a quick game to get through. For example, one round of Game 6 with 2 players took 2 hours. Our son has a hard time staying on task and remaining focused but this is not a problem for him while we play!There are some instances when we are unsure of a rule in a specific situation and cannot find an answer in any of rule books. Ie: Can we place the Petrificus Totalus spell on Voldemort when he is not the only remaining villain? We just improvise and end up creating our own (moderately challenging) rule to continue play.

  This is an AMAZING game. I loved it from the first time I played it, and have since introduced 7 more people to it, some of whom have even bought it themselves since then. :) It's easy to learn, easy to follow, and fun to play. I highly recommend it to any tabletop gamer who is even just a casual Harry Potter fan.That said, my Year 3 cards are a mess. Seven of them were misprinted (some even on the wrong size card stock) and/or mis-cut. As for the character cards (which contain information absolutely crucial to game play): The cards were mis-printed so badly that the information on them is undecipherable, leaving the cards - and therefore this and future Years of the game - unplayable. We were about to start Year 3 and had to stop because we cannot read the character cards.(Year 7 is fine except for the cardboard tokens, which aren't printed well for where the machine stamps the cut lines. It's fine, the tokens are just a little mangled. Totally playable though. No serious issue, just want the manufacturer to be aware so they can adjust their settings.)I'm still giving this game a 5-star review because it's great - for play, appearance, price, timeliness of shipping, etc. - and I'm assuming the messed up cards are an anomaly. But I will definitely be pursuing Year 3 replacement cards because what I was sold leaves the game unplayable beyond year 2 out of 7. I'll update with the seller's resolution.

It would have been easy for the designers to just make a generic card game and slap Harry Potter graphics and text on it.  But they actually put a lot of effort into designing the abilities, play, etc around the Harry Potter theme.To give a great example: Crabbe and Goyle.  They're a Villain in this game which are easy to deal with and don't do much damage to you.  My family and I developed a strategy where we would just leave them around on the board as long as possible, since they were so weak and easy to play around.  Eventually we realized ... that's exactly why Crabbe and Goyle are in all the movies/books!  They provide a ""villain"" in the stories without being an actual threat.  Very funny.  But that kind of weaving of how characters play in the game is presenting in the design of all the cards.The game is easy to learn and play, so it's great for families and friends who don't have the patience for more ""hardcore"" board games.  Some of the people we play with are down with hardcore games, but not everyone is, which often makes it hard to have larger gaming get togethers.  This game is perfect because anyone can pick it up and have fun with it, but it isn't so easy that it isn't interesting to play.  It still requires thinking, strategy, and working together.  You just don't have to deal with a novel's worth of complex rules.To top it all off, it's a coop game, so no one feels like they're losing.It's basically the perfect game for groups.I really hope the makers of this game apply their skills to other movies/books!

Fun fanciful game, and you can speed it up easily if needed

  We are playing with one younger child and finding the games super charming and fun but they go on too long. To fix this we start in about 2/3 of the way into the game (we are on game 3). So we use it the last location, 4 villains, and randomly add 5 or more Hogwarts cards to each hand. This also allows more use of the special fun cards by all players (like Dumbledore might show up) and allows the heroes even footing even if you end up with the hardest villains first. Most importantly we can finish before bedtime and it's just as fun. Just an idea if you are having the same problem!As an update, both boys love this game so much, it's definitely the most time they spend nicely together during this shelter in place. We don't bother shortening the game anymore because it's a staple on the table ü§£. Now they are still starting with a few extra cards from the previous game but they also made up new villains to add. Even the one that can barely read is writing up a storm. If your family likes the books, don't hesitate!

Addictive fun whether you‚Äôre a witch, squib, or muggle (or not even a fan of the series)
","

  The solid mechanics of this game make it engaging, complex, and almost as much fun to lose as to win. If you enjoy the books or movies it has a bit of extra fun, but no knowlege of the Potter series is required to become an effective player. I have played with kids as young as seven, but they are too young to really get deep strategy; to survive later levels, play after the young ones are sent to bed.  The game now appears on my ‚Äúbuy it again‚Äù list as a repeat purchase candidate because after playing it together I have purchased three more copies as gifts for friends.The game itself is well designed and offers increasing difficulty even for veteran players.  It is broken up into seven ‚Äúgames‚Äù that align with the books, and it is intended that you successfully complete the earlier games/levels before moving on to the next.  Since it is entirely possible you may need more than one attempt to get through a game, I want to issue a warning that a gaming session intended to end at 9 PM will quickly turn into parents realizing the roar of victory needs to be muted because it‚Äôs 1:30 AM.The cards have a mix of original artwork - including some inspired by characters or locations as rendered in the films - and photos of objects and actors as they appeared for movie fans.  One of the more frustrating aspects to me is that some of the most frequently used and shuffled cards are an uncommonly sized square for which I cannot find protective sleeves!The flow of the game generally goes like this: the bad guys are attempting to take over Hogwarts and if they succeed the good guys - you - are cooked.  Each player chooses a main character and receives a basic set of abilities, spells, items, and a helpful ally.  Players use these cards to gain power for attacks, restore health for themselves or other players, or influence to gain new spells, items, and allies.Of course, the game has to give the bad guys a chance, and it‚Äôs a better chance than you as players have of winning. Each player turn one or more dark arts events takes place that weakens characters, limits play options for the turn, or deals damage to the characters.  Whatever villain(s) is/are in play then have an opportunity to deal damage, weaken the characters, or otherwise increase the threat level.  You may have noticed the ‚Äúvillain(s)‚Äù comment.  As the game levels get higher or as the threat level increases - like when there are three locations at which you are expected to battle dark forces and they‚Äôve managed to take over two already - each player turn may require up to three dark arts events and your group may simultaneously be facing four villains, one of which is Voldemort himself!  Expect to play some levels multiple times.Play is easy to learn and individual turns can go quickly, but strategic coordination of turns (eg: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to leave Molly in case Neville can get six influence on his turn and I‚Äôm leaving the spells for Hermione, but I‚Äôm snagging Mad Eye to maximize my polyjuice potion next turn...‚Äù) can take a while to weigh out the options and can make all the difference.I cannot recommend this game more, and have yet to find a person who doesn‚Äôt play it and want a copy before the night is over.  Do yourself a favor and pick up your own set.

This is my new favorite board game!!
","

  Where do I even start?! This game is absolutely amazing! It is challenging, fun, suspenseful, sometimes frustrating, and all-around magical! It brings out our inner-geeks every time. This is the first cooperative board game we have played, but we love that we are working together and helping each other out for one common goal rather than each of us trying to win individually. Visually, the game is beautifully made. There are a lot of pieces to this game, but they are all well-made and store conveniently and compactly in the box. The directions are a little unclear at first, but once you start playing you figure it out pretty quickly. There are endless variations to the outcomes of each round, depending on how many people are playing, which characters you play, and the order of the way the cards are drawn and played. It definitely takes skill and strategy that you have to learn along the way. Once we start playing a round we are hooked for hours, because we just have to beat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named! I have told many friends who love Harry Potter about this game, and their families have all gotten as hooked on this game as we have!

One of the best board games I've ever played!

  My husband, friends, anyone who I introduce this game to typically becomes addicted to it pretty quick. Even if you're not  a massive Harry Potter fan, the game-play is really fun. The first few levels are pretty easy to allow you the time to pick up how to play and then it builds quickly into a really challenging game. And even after several play throughs, we still will occasionally lose as its never the same game twice. Really good fun and quite easy to learn and set up. Cannot recommend this game enough and really wish they'd make it with other themes as well!

Has some mechanical flaws, but still lots of fun
","

  I'm a big fan of cooperative games and deck-building games, and this may be my current favorite in the intersection of those two (I also really like Marvel Legendary, but the setup/takedown time on that is a barrier to getting it to the table, while this gets out of the box pretty quickly). I've already played through all 7 games several times, once as a group of 3 and twice as a group of 4 (with another play in progress), and everyone I've played it with has loved it. The Harry Potter theme is admittedly a big part of the appeal, so someone who isn't into the theme won't get as much out of it, but the game itself holds up well enough that it doesn't require everyone to be a big Potter fan to enjoy the game.There are a few mechanical problems to be aware of. My biggest complaint (and it's a big one) is that, especially once the introductory games are out of the way, the game ultimately comes down to location control cards (ones that remove control tokens from the location) -- getting a bunch of those early trivializes the game (as long as you're able to keep removing tokens quickly, nothing else really matters, and it becomes very easy to finish the game on location 1 with few or no tokens), and having no location control cards available early tends to doom you. The result is that most games are either runaway victories or crushing defeats (with the likelihood of these two outcomes depending on what year is being played), with relatively few close/tense games. Another problem (which sounds like it may be addressed to some extent in the expansion, which I have not played) is that there is no way to remove cards from your deck (a standard feature of virtually all deckbuilders), which combined with a fair number of underpowered cards available for purchase can lead the 6 purchase slots to become clogged up with useless cards unless someone buys cards they don't want (and weakens their deck in doing so) just to get them out of the way and allow new cards to come out.With that in mind, the game is a great deal of fun, and I highly recommend it to Harry Potter fans in particular (but not exclusively). This game does a better job than any other that I have seen in making every character seem essential because of their unique abilities -- that differentiation goes a long way toward making everyone feel useful, which is great in a cooperative game.

Disappointed
","

  Best thing about the game is that it's a Harry Potter product.  Everything else is a let down.Several of the cards had super differently colored backs, which lets you know what cards are coming up next on your deck. Pretty disappointing to accidentally know what you're about to draw.  Looks like just really poorly done printing and no real QC?I only played through all of the games once and several of the cards are already torn and damaged even though we've been very careful with them, so they're pretty low quality.The board itself has several folds in the decal that's adhered to the top of it, so it's not smooth and cards get stuck randomly.  It doesn't look very nice, just looks like it was done cheaply in a hurry.As for the game-play itself, it can be frustrating.  Once you get into later games, it's way too easy for your first 2 or 3 villains to be really overpowered compared to the cards you have available at the start, and it's way too easy once you get to the end for the fights to become pretty trivial.  It feels as much like a game of luck as one of skill, which can be fun, but not really what I was looking for.Essentially, it gets 2 stars just for being Harry Potter, so if you're a super fan of the series, you may enjoy it just off of that.  Otherwise, it's just a poorly put together game with really low quality manufacturing and non-existent quality control.  Wouldn't buy again and wouldn't recommend.

Everyone who played it put it on their wish list when they got home

  So. Fun. I brought it to an extended-family-get-together and everyone who played it put it on their Christmas wish list when they got home. Even the players who had never read or watched anything Potter-related enjoyed it. It has seven games of increasing difficulty (of course, you don't play all seven in one go!), so it will keep you occupied for a good long time. Great replay value, too, as different cards and abilities will appear in a different order each time. I think it will remain my favorite game for the next decade! I figured out how to play it solo, too (for when I just HAVE to play another round, but am home alone); I just play two of the characters (Ron, Hermione, Neville or Harry). One is supposed to play it with two to four players. It now has an expansion game (The Monster Box of Monsters) that adds Luna Lovegood as a possible player (though even with the expansion pack, this remains a four player max. game). Hogwarts Battle is a cooperative deck-building game that my brother compared to Pandemic (never played that one), so if you like Pandemic, you will most likely enjoy Hogwarts Battle.

Super fun! Initially easy, but much more challenging later!
","

  Read the reviews, and let me say, they do not do this game justice. Found it to be extremely entertaining. Really is cooperative and initial rule set is easy enough for my 7 year old to keep up.Premise is up to four players cooperate to defeat dark wizards through seven successively difficult encounters. Each player assumes the role of one of the main characters in this quest. Each stage adds additional adversaries, player cards, character upgrades, and story locations which generally add to the preceding stage's scenario cards. For instance, players face three adversaries in the first round. The second round adds three additional adversaries, bringing the total adversary count to six adversaries to beat to complete round two. By the last round (seven), the players will face a total of 20 adversaries and be required to destroy 4 horocruxes in order to beat the game.The instruction book clearly presents game mechanics and all game pieces are high quality card stock which should last for years if taken care of. The only complaint is that the item shipped with a label applied directly to the cellophane vice in a package. It arrived with the wrapping and box damaged somewhat, but all the pieces were present and undamaged, so I wasn't too upset.Can't recommend this game enough. Highly recommended!

  Love this game! If you are a Harry Potter fan, I highly recommend. If you thoroughly read the instructions, it's very easy to learn. My husband and I have not yet finished the game although we've played through the last level ( just haven't ""beat"" the last year of game play) the details of the game are thoughtful and it's really fun. I will say that neither of us are game players typically. I think the last board game we purchased was monopoly. So, again you don't have to be an expert game person to enjoy this. Alternatively, I would not say it's super easy but I don't have anything to compare my experience to. All in all, if you want a fun way to spend the evening with friends or family, this is a great choice for fans! I would say depending on what year ( level) you're in, game play can last anywhere from 1-2.5 hours. In fact, I started playing the movies when we would start the games from the 2nd year go forward and often times we'd finish the game with the movie. (We did take breaks, or make a snack, walk our dogs when necessary... so it didn't technically take as long as the movie but hopefully that's a good gauge.) highly recommend!

  This is very much an advanced deck building game. We haven‚Äôt played past game one yet but I am looking forward to getting more into it.It says 11 and up, which is probably for the best unless your kid already is really into card games and deck builders. My 10 yo had fun with it but is still struggling a little with continuous card effects.Super positive note: this truly is a cooperative game. No one wins if someone loses. It is absolutely players vs the game. I found it an excellent way to use family time to bond instead of pitting ourselves against one another to win a game.This is a must have for Potterhead Gamers everywhere.UPDATE:We‚Äôve made it to Game 4 and holy woah! We got our butts kicked. We had been playing up to Game 3 for weeks and hadn‚Äôt lost a game yet but adding 4 was the game changer.Still a lot of fun and now we have a challenge ahead of us that we can work out together as a family.

  If you are fan of Harry Potter and like board games my opinion is you will like this.  I've only played this with my wife, therefore, it was two people against the game.  The first 2-3 decks/adventures are fairly easy.  I believe it is the fourth deck/adventure where it got much harder and we beat it only 1 out of 4 times so far.  We haven't tried the other decks yet.  Depending on how the non-playing villain's cards are shuffled and turned over can make the game easy or downright HARD.  I would assume playing 3-4 players makes the game much easier, but its a fun challenge.  We sit with our Harry Potter wands and 'cast' the spells when we play a spell card.  I'd estimate the first few decks take less than an hour, but the fourth deck (the ones that introduce the dice) is taking at least 90 minutes of casual play.  Replay value is high as it all depends on which cards you choose to add to your play deck.  You may go a few games without seeing the powerful cards again, or your team mate may take that card and make it unavailable for you to use.

  My son, daughter, and I enjoyed playing this at first.  However, it is just too easy.  It gets progressively harder, but we are on the 6th part and my kids have lost interest already (so have I).  The games also last longer the further along you get, but doesn't really get any harder (except for a few nuisances that are thrown in, like drawing an extra event card, and facing multiple bad guys).  This does prolong the game, but if you get cards that take away a mark on the location early in the game, there is ZERO challenge.  You are able to take away the marks on a location more frequent than you add them.  I guess I should mention you win by defeating all the bad guys before losing all 3 locations.  Unfortunately, it just feels like you are just going through the motions over and over...knowing that you are going to eventually win.

It works. Good quality. Lots of cards.

  Great fun. Nice cooperative game to play with others to avoid hurt feelings, players ""out of the game"", and to make things feel low-stakes and casual. You never really rely on others players, it's just that some players can help each other out when possible, but no one loses before anyone else. You all lose at once.There aren't any story events from the books during each year. As you progress through years, your character cards swap out for older portraits and new enemies and spells are introduced, but your starting character spells never change. You always have to rebuild the deck and gain low level spells even in later years, which seems pretty silly. The strategy can be dumbed down after a while and it really just depends on who the starting villains you get dealt are. You could spend as long as you want building your deck if you get someone like Crabbe and Goyle in the first round.Dont expect this to be story-rich or something. Seems to just be harry potter themed, in the sense that this could really be almost any other story or universe that has multiple books or a serialized progression and it would also have worked fine. They just happened to pick Harry Potter. That could be a good thing however, since you essentially need zero harry potter knowledge to play.

  This is a cooperative deck building game that ultimately follows along with the 7 Books to create 7 Games that build off of each other as you develop your game play ability. Just like the characters in the books/movies. Really a fantastic concept. You and/or the other players play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Nevile. The object is to defeat the villains (Draco, A Basilisk, Dementors, etc.) before said villains take over all your locations.We really like that, just like the novels, this game builds on itself 7 times. Game 1 is complete in and of itself, but adding the material of another ‚ÄúGame box‚Äù will change it in certain ways. Each of the boxes change the locations you‚Äôre competing for along with adding in new abilities, items, spells, villains‚Ä¶. You get new abilities as you ‚Äúmature‚Äù and can add an additional ability to your proficiencies after completing your O.W.L.s!! One of the game boxes also add dice...to a deck building game that starts off without dice. Pretty Cool!The board, cards, and tokens are all very good quality with everything is in full color and images taken from the movies. Nothing flimsy or wanting and your character grows up as your progress (just like in ‚Äúreal-life‚Äù). It‚Äôs nice that the game developers include organizer cards if you don‚Äôt want the game mixed together and want to divide it back out to the separate levels without having to stick them back into the separate boxes (all the villains together, all the Dark Art Events together, etc.) once you've opened the individual games box and moved up the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù.I‚Äôve been trying to find a way to get my partner more into board games and because of the individual Game 1-7 add-on features, this is an excellent intro to Eurogames. It starts off simple but ramps up after you get used to the mechanics. Also, it helped that with her love of Harry Potter this games adherence to the canon really well!!

Really fun game night addition!
","

  About two years ago, my boyfriend got me into board games. We have about twenty games on our board game shelving unit, some of my favorites being Ticket to Ride: Europe, Dominion, and some party games like Codenames and Sushi Go. I've been turned into a board game addict and find myself finding any excuse to throw a game night possible. We've converted both of our extended families (that previously claimed to be ""not into board games"") and some of our friends into board game people. HOWEVER, my boyfriend has been playing games like Settlers of Catan for about twenty years now, is very analytical, great at strategy, and you can probably see where I'm going with this- he kicks our butts in everything all the time without trying. I usually come in a solid second place, but even when he's tried to let me win games, I don't normally do too hot. CONSEQUENTLY, I'm into co-op games now and we use this game to ease highly competitive family members into a new way of thinking of games when they've only played Monopoly.If you ask the boyfriend, he says that years 1-3 of this game are too easy and repetitive. If you ask me, they're still fun and are especially great for getting newbies used to turns before things get to be high stakes. You can play as many or as few years in one sitting as you want, so for the sake of time, we do usually start at year 4 when we play this game with just the two of us. We've actually only gotten through year 7 about 4 times and still have yet to win. If you play with 4 players, you just take too much damage and the locations get taken over pretty quickly as a consequence. No biggie if you're playing with an experienced group that likes a challenge, but a group of our friends got demoralized by year 7 and ask to skip it when we play this game with more than 3 people.Also- you don't really have to know anything about Harry Potter to play this game. It certainly helps, but you'll be fine if you're just looking for another co-op game to play and know nothing.

Great Harry Potter Game!!!

  This is an awesome game that the creators put a lot of thought into it. I first thought that this was going to be a very cheesy movie game and its far from that. There are 7 games in this big box. Basically its 1 for each year or book. I'm not going to give away any spoilers here so don't worry. The first year is fairly easy but if your not working together you could easily loose. As you progress with each year/game box you can see how difficult it can be. There is also new foes to beat each round as well as the old ones. Each year you move on to you are adding to the game. Year 4/game 4 you get some upgrades. This was/is a lot of fun to play. You do have to talk with your fellow players to work out a strategy to defeated the villains.My only complaint I have is not with the game but with Amazon. The game was shipped to me with just plastic wrap and shipping label on it. So much for the element of surprised. I expected it to arrive in a box as nearly everything else I have ordered tends to arrive in. But instead it was shipped with a plain simple plastic wrap and arrived slightly damaged on the corner.Outside of that, if you are on the fence about this game just go ahead and get it--you will not be unhappy that you did. Also find a youtube video on how they play the game as well.

  I bought this on a whim for my twelve year old Harry Potter fan last Christmas and it was an instant hit! It took a little bit to get the rules down but if you're used to deck building games, it comes a little easier. I was worried it would be a one hit wonder but we've played it dozens of times since then! It's easy to go back and play through because it's different every time, though we usually stick to the third or later games if all four of us are playing. My kids have also been known to pull out the board and cards and play on their own or make up their own games to go with the pieces. It's been a ton of fun for all of us and I'm so glad we purchased it. My nine year old had no trouble with the game or rules, though she gets a little impatient if the game is taking a while. Overall, the designers did a really great job with this game. We even bought the expansion pack and love that too! I thought it would just be a money grab gimmick but it's actually really well done and a lot of fun. I definitely recommend it!

  Great for two players. It's cooperative / easy on the marriage.  Well made game that walks you through each of the books.  The game gets more and more complicated the more you play it (the first book is almost too easy and the last book is almost too hard).  The advantage with this is that you are nearly guaranteed at least 7 play-throughs (which is rare) since each book adds something new and more complicated / more challenging.  There are elements of luck, which sometimes can make you lose pretty quickly, but mostly it's a well-balanced game with luck and strategy.  It's a deck-building game, so you have to pick a strategy and build your deck around it to succeed (except for the first two books, which play more like a warm-up / intro to the game, where you can get away with using no strategy.

In fact, many of our family members have even purchased it or asked for it for Christmas. It's also great to play when we get together with gaming friends. With most games we'll often have to ""pause"" the game as one of us will get called out to attend to the kiddos. With this game, if you want, you can play the person who is absents turn.

  Fantastic game. Be warned, it is difficult. We played at the beginning with box one. Even if you are familiar with this style of game, you should start with one. It's a great slow intro to the game. It took multiple trys to get past each box.My wife and I also play just the 2 of us. When doing 2 player, I highly recommend playing as all 4 characters. Each player plays as 2 of the main characters and game plays as normal. I do not see how you could play it with just 2 of the 4. The game is difficult. A lot of the time winning is a matter of chance with how the villains are drawn. Get a bad combination of villains out and you can pretty much hang it up. You're not going to win.If you are a sore looser. Pass on this game. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOSE! This isn't an easy win, get a participation award just for showing up kinda game.

The first couple of games (1 -3) are more or less introductory - learning the basics of what you can do and not do each turn/round. Game play is basic but enjoyable.  We had almost no fear of ""losing"".  By the time we started playing game four...things got interesting and more complex.  We lost the first time we played round 4 but were able to beat it on the second try.  We've played other deck building games before such as Clank, Dominion, and others...and this one is a new favorite too.  You do need to cooperate with each other, playing to each person's character strengths which could mean allowing each team member to purchase the right cards that benefit the group instead of your individual wants at times...example: I played as Ron and his card deck works best with more ""ally"" cards.  My sister would pass on purchasing some of the ally cards to make sure I could own them on my turn.  My brother played as Nevil and his strengths were in healing, so he typically gathered cards that allowed him to give all ""heroes"" extra hearts.

Harry Potter Fans: This is Great for the Whole Family
","

  I purchased this for my 8yr old for his birthday and everyone in the family loves this game! I love that we work together, lots less fighting between siblings than other family games we play. We (parents) even played without the kids one night!There are seven games (progressively harder) inside the box. The first three games are basically to help you understand the rules and learn how to play. So, we easily beat the first three games, but it was great to learn as we had never played a deck-building game before.  Game 4 had us stumped until we figured out a strategy.Overall, this is the only deck-building game we've played, but if you are a fan of the books or movies I recommend this! Although, the manufacturer age recommendation is 11 years my 8 year old excels at this and enjoys it very much, as do my 10 and 13 year olds.I will be buying the expansion pack!

Great Game!
","

  I bought this for husband for his birthday. I was worried that it wouldn't be good for adults, but it is! I would actually say it's more suited for adults than children. Maybe ages 12+. It's quite a long game and I could see children getting restless while playing or having trouble keeping up with all of the different steps and tasks. We've had this game for months and we still play it at least once a week, for hours and hours. There are so many ways to make it different each time you play, so you never get tired of it. It is always a challenge. The board, box, and components are all great quality. I was so pleased! Definitely worth the price! A great gift for any Harry Potter fan!

  My brother in law introduced us to this game. It can be pretty addicting. Some other reviewers posted quality issues so as soon as I got mine I looked through everything and fortunately my copy is perfect, nothing missing and no printing issues.As fun as this game is, it does have some balance issues. As a result some people make up ""house rules."" If you have made your own house rules please reply with what they are, I'm interested. We have 2 rules so far, if 3 of the 6 cards are the same the player has the option to replace all 6 cards and if all 6 card values are 5 or greater the play has the option to replace them all.

  Flash Point Fire Rescue is a cooperative board game for 1-6 players. The game comes with two ‚Äúmodes‚Äù, a basic game and an advanced mode. The advanced mode almost reminds me more of an included expansion. This review will focus primarily on the beginner mode, but we will discuss the advanced mode later.In both games the goal is basically the same, save 7-10 victims of the fire. Along the way, you will have to deal with smoke, fire, explosions, wall collapses, and in the more advanced game, hazmat and hotspot areas. My play experience with this game is limited to two players. This makes the more advanced game a little too cumbersome if you want to take advantage of all the various characters. In the basic mode, each character has the exact same abilities.In the basic game, each player receives a generic firefighter with basic abilities. You get four points (called Action Points or APs) to use each turn. Various actions, such as walking, putting out a fire, changing a fire to smoke, putting out smoke, chopping down walls (be careful with this), and carrying victims costs so many points. If you have points at the end of your turn, you can bank them by taking tokens. You can also share your extra points with another player.How to Win: Rescue the correct number of victims depending on the mode of play (basic mode is 7).How to lose: There are two ways you can lose in Flash Point Fire Rescue.1. If you allow four victims to die (get caught in an explosion or fire) you lose. It should be noted that your firefighter does not die when caught in a fire/explosion, but is blown all the way to the nearest parking spot. He must then re-enter the building either through a main door or collapsed wall.2. You can also lose if the building collapses from too much damage to walls (using black cubes to track).My Review This is one of the go to games for my wife and I. As mentioned before, we primarily play the basic game. It provides enough challenge to prevent us from winning each time, but still makes winning both achievable and challenging at the same time.The instruction book was clear and easy to read, though early on, we seemed to refer to it frequently, especially with regards to explosions and how damaged walls and open doors can affect the game.The components are pretty solid and the two sided board does allow for even more variety. I suppose my biggest complaint is that the firefighters are different colors, but other than that are identical. It would have been nice to have had more unique characters, especially for the advanced mode.Update: (Dec 2017) - My wife and I played this game as a four player beginner game and found this a bit cumbersome. It seems it is probably best with 3 as it always seemed like one player didn't really know what to do. Overall ratings not affected, but I would hesitate to put four in the game unless you are playing the expert variant. Overall Ratings:Instructions: 8/10Ease of Play: Basic Mode: 8/10Components: 7/10Replay Value: 10/10 (If you roll for where to place the fire/victims at the start instead of using the standard setup.)Overall Rating: 8.25

  Finally, a co-op game that doesn't suffer from the ""Alpha Gamer"" problem, of one gamer having to quarterback everyone else's moves for them! My experience with co-op games hasn't been great. Pandemic, Spirit Island, Ghost Stories, all left me flat. With Flash Point, however, you get a game that's as ""thinky"" as you want it to be, but without the punishing nature of one bad move ruining the whole game.On top of that, it's incredibly easy to grasp. I brought this on a business trip to play with colleagues after-hours. Most of them non-gamer types, were able to grasp it in a few minutes and we were able to pull of a 75% win-rate using the ""experienced"" rules on the lowest difficulty...and had a great time doing it! Granted, there is a strong dice-rolling element in this, so randomness can either help or hinder you, but a well played game can, but wont always, mitigate some of that.The components are great quality, you get a double sided game-board for different experiences and different difficulties, and there are so many expansions for this that take the game in many different directions. For the price, this is a great value. When you compare the price per hour to things like movies, you'll get your money's worth out of just a handful of plays.

Easier to win but no less fun than other co-op games
","

  I supervise an after-school game group for teens (mostly boys), and they're pretty good board gamers.  (I played the 'Lord of the Rings' co-op game with them and we actually won.  If you've tried it, you might know how difficult that is.)  We jumped right into the advanced rules of Flash Point (Recruit Level) and it was pretty easy for us, but the boys immediately wanted to play it again at a higher difficulty level, which speaks volumes to me about the fun-factor and replay value of 'Flash Point.'Like most cooperative games, each player has a specific role within the group based on their skill or character.  Flash Point is unique in that players can actually change their specializations during the game, so you don't get stuck the entire time with a skill that becomes useless or redundant at some point.  I think the player specializations in 'Flash Point' are more thematic than in any other cooperative game.  In 'Shadows Over Camelot' (my other favorite) for example, character skills allow you to do things like pass cards between players or look at the top card of a deck - helpful, but artificial.  In 'Flash Point,' your skills might allow you to treat wounded victims, dispose of hazmat, or use the truck to spray a large area - things real firefighters actually DO.Most co-operative games follow the formula of ""take your actions and then something bad usually happens"" on each player's turn.  Players then must talk and decide how to utilize each of their skills to slow down the bad stuff while working toward their shared objectives.  Nothing new in that area here, but again it's the way the design incorporates things like chain explosions and structural damage to create tension and a sense of urgency that fit the theme of firefighting so well.Currently there are still only a handful of cooperative board games on the market, and they vary in degree of difficulty.  I've played nearly all of them, and they're pretty good.  'Forbidden Island' and 'Castle Panic' are great for younger kids because they set up and play quickly and are easier to win.  'Shadows Over Camelot' and 'Lord of the Rings' can be extremely trying even for the experienced, but deeply satisfying.  I'd put 'Flash Point' and 'Pandemic' in the middle.  I prefer 'Flash Point' primarily for the variety of firefighter specializations, and the greater sense of thematic tension that comes from trying to rescue everyone as fire and explosions tear through the building.

My great cooperative game that everyone will love
","

  Super fun game! A good coop game. I've had many friends over to play and everyone (ranging from those who do not really like strategy games, to those who love them) has enjoyed it. I've liked it so much that sometimes I play it by myself. It isn't overly complicated so new players can quickly learn the rules and have meaningful opinions.It is coop, so everyone wins or everyone looses. This means that people who don't like strategy games will not feel like they are being dominated by those who do. Everything is important. Every character role is worth playing. You will regret ignoring hazardous material. Ignoring how much damage the house is taking will lead to its collapse.I personally think that this is slightly more fun than Pandemic (and I really like Pandemic). It feels more exciting.

Easy to Learn Hard to Win
","

  This is possibly one of my favorite coop games of all time.  The mechanics and rules(Basic Rules) are fairly simple, yet it does give you the feeling of being a firefighter.  You're wandering through a burning house, searching for victims and things are exploding all around you.  Then, you are almost out of the  house and a fire flares up right on top of you and you're knocked down and you've lost a victim.  It really is  an ingenious game and quite a lot of fun.  I've not played with all the player counts, but for even two players it is fun. I think it would do well at gaming conventions, also.  I will probably run it at the next one I attend.  Now, I've not played with any of the ""advanced rules"", but I have read them over.  At first, it seemed they had a potential for adding a lot of complexity to  the game, but I think if you, as the designer suggested, add in a few new rules at a time until you get used to them, there shouldn't be any problem.  Some see these new rules and player abilities as ""pigeon-holing"" them to certain roles and that might be true to a certain extent, every player still has the capability to enter the house and rescue victims.  The hot spots do give the potential for really spreading the fire fast, but with the ability to  shower down water from above, I believe it balances out.  All in all, a great, fun game with lots of replayability and with the expansions you have a lot of options for new game boards and new scenarios. Top notch game.

One Of The Best CO-OP Games Around and Really Fun For Children.
","

  One of the best co-op games I've played and I've played a lot of them. My biggest problem with a lot of co-op games is that it's really easy for one experienced player to sort of ""dominate"" the game and it becomes little more than one player doing everything while everyone else sort of sits there and watches. This can happen without the person ""quarterbacking"" even realizing they're doing it. While it can happen in Flash Point it's not as common. The game is set up in a way that each player can make their own decisions and regardless of natural strategic abilities still be effective. This is also a terrific game to play with children. While it may be slightly dark in tone (having a victim burn up if you're team is unable to save them on time) the art is abstract enough that it's not overly so.

A simple but instantly engrossing struggle against ever-worsening odds that has depth (and a bunch of nice details).
","

  One of the most enjoyable games I know that can be played in less than an hour, Flash Point Fire Rescue is a superior, more detailed variation of a dire situation game like Pandemic. Instead of dealing with abstractions in a distant global setting, FPFR puts the players (or player) in a burning house where collapsing walls, exploding hazmats, and imperiled victims compete for every precious action point while the second hand of destruction moves forward.A good combination of luck and skill, this game is a fun and exciting losing battle in which players must make life saving and life ending decisions every turn and hope that the courses chosen and the courses neglected result in the most saved people.The character skills also mix things up nicely, though maybe the Imaging Technician's special skill of identifying Points of Interest is too powerful (choosing that character really improved my success rate right away), but the game is smart, exciting, and the deployment of the vehicles is an especially fun variable. Behold the deck guns!Unlike Agricola (which is clever but has far too much piece relocation/counting for my taste), Pandemic (which is fairly decent but kind of annoying and very abstract), and Catan (which I thought was quite dull), Flash Point Fire Rescue is a good gateway game that fires my gamer imagination and can show off the merits of modern board games to curious non-gamers as well. A simple but instantly engrossing struggle against ever worsening odds with depth and a bunch of nice details.

Fun but very based on luck
","

  It's pretty fun. I really enjoy it. It's just kind of luck-based...my husband and I have played 4 times now. 1 game was tough, we nearly lost, but the other 3 games it felt like we got really lucky and won easily. So I think it's more luck-based than I was expecting. It makes sense when half the game is based on dice rolls, but I just didn't realize it would affect the game so much.Don't get me wrong, it's fun and a great length--a game usually takes us 30-45 minutes, which is perfect when you only have a little bit of time and don't want to get into a giant complicated fantasy game or something. I don't regret buying it.

A modern co-op classic.

  If you like cooperative board games like Pandemic, Flashpoint should be added to your collection as well. While it's a little more fiddly than Pandemic, once you learn the rules it's no less fun and frantic. I can't think of much else to say because it's a great players-vs-game experience with plenty of strategy and well-balanced difficulty so you probably won't win every time. A family variant is included in the rulebook to simplify things for younger players as well. The firefighter theme is also great, it's a nice break from the constant fantasy and sci-fi themed board games out there.If you like games like Pandemic or prefer to cooperate instead of compete, Flashpoint is an easy recommendation.

  This game is fantastic!I'm a big fan of co-op board games, and this one is not only incredible to play again and again, but also easy to teach to beginners.What really sets this game apart is the tiered difficulty levels. Have someone who's never played? Start with the base setup and walk it through. Have some regulars who want a bit more of a challenge? Ramp it up with the modifiers and add the job system!I loved it so much I went right out to Kickstarter and supported the add-on pack he was trying to create- and donated enough to the cause to get all the other add-ons, too!There's a reason all of his games fund as well as they do on Kickstarter; they're addicting, adaptable, and extremely re-playable!Highly recommend for your board game shelf.

Super family game with many different level of difficulty
","

  This game is a great family game.  I'd say ages 8 and up based on ability to concentrate. This game has so many options you can add into play.  You start very basic to learn the rules, and the first game will be slow and challenging and you questions things, look up answers in the instructions and play it through...but then you are hooked and you'll want to play again and again.PARENTS- a word of caution, you may want to play the first game on your own or with older children because the first game is slow and will quickly lose the interest of a younger child. But by the time you play it the 2nd and definitely by the 3rd time...you've got it figured out and it plays smoothly and with excitement.After you figure out the basic rules, you can add in all sorts of different levels of difficulty.  The back of the board has a different floor plan for more advanced play as well as many, many options.  The great thing is you pick and choose what you want in each game you play.  The game is built to be flexible and it's like having 30 different levels of a game all in one.  AWESOME!

Top Notch fun and customizable cooperative game
","

  I bought this for a family of adults to enjoy on game night. So far we've played it at 'Family' level (basic game) and enjoyed it. My son-in-law, who is a paramedic, found it mostly realistic, which is rare in a board game. My son and I have played it at 'Recruit' level, omitting some of the additional rules. That's a great feature of the game: the rules are well balanced so that you can pick and choose which ones you want to play without skewing the game. We like that you can change roles so you don't get stuck with an obsolete role. And, if there's only two of you, you can each control a couple of fire fighters. Although there is a certain amount of luck involved, real fires are unpredictable too. We were within one space of winning the game (just had to get the last victim out the door) when the building collapsed on us. The way in which the game handles fires, explosions, damage, flashover, shockwave, etc, give a degree of realism and suspense to the game. The rules are clearly written and logically laid out, so if you follow them step by step, it makes perfect sense. (I hate games where the rules are so poorly written you spend longer trying to figure them out than playing the game). Flash Point also includes two different maps with one being more challenging than the other. In short, it's enjoyable, realistic, and replayable.Update: We've now played the game at all difficulties levels and I've played it solo a number of times. I'm even more impressed. The game scales well and is flexible enough that if you're creative, you can make up your own hazards, specialists, and victory conditions. This now my absolute favorite board game. I like it better than Pandemic, to which is is often compared, because Pandemic is too abstract for me. (In Pandemic, you're pushing little plastic cubes around the map.) Flash Point is realistic enough that I find myself immersed in the world of the game, almost like a roleplaying game.

  I was looking for a new cooperative game and came across this on a Youtube channel.  I play with my girlfriend and friends Castle Panic and we all love it so I was excited to give this one a shot.  I played this with both a friend of mine who is into more comprehensive games and 2 others who are into more mild and tame games and all of them loved it.  The game has a decent amount to it, and there is quite a bit you have to remember, but once you play through it, it is not complex or difficult.  It is a lot of fun and we were getting really into it. I liked how the board has two sides with 2 different house layouts so it adds some change in the game, as well as the fact you can basically set the game up however you want by just choosing how many fires to start with and rolling to see where they go.  One thing I found was the game has a ""quick start guide"" and then advanced rules, where, actually, strangely enough, the advanced rules actually make the game easier as each firefighter gets certain abilities.  We just stick to the basic rules and have a blast.  There are also expansions for this game which is nice as well!  If you like cooperative games, I highly recommend this for any type of gamer.

Big Damn Heroes!
","

  Every time you go back into a building that is about to collapse to save one more survivor, or keep fighting the fire to give the rest of the team a few more seconds, you really feel the risk.  When one of your team can't make it out in time, it can be crushing.  And even when you all make it out, it can really feel like failure if you know you can't rescue everyone inside, even when you have rescued enough to 'win'.  So when you do get everyone safely out, and the crew has all survived, you feel like big damn heroes.  [a Firefly reference]

  So glad we found this game after looking for more cooperative games to enjoy with middle school teens. We've played it several times already with our boys, one of whom rarely wants to play games, especially more than once! He actually likes this one. We are going to use it for a teen game club soon also. My empath heart does get sad if we lose someone to the fire, but it also prompts good discussion about it being worth trying - even if/when we sometimes fail at things in real life - for the times when we succeed.  Glad to have an alternative theme like this in a cooperative game that isn't all about fighting something, even as a team! Money well spent for this one. Game component quality also good. This one has us looking for more like it.

A Wonderful Chance
","

  This was a chance purchase. I didn't know what this game was about but it looked interesting so I got it. What a wonderful surprise! I've found that most people that I introduce this to love playing it. Even ones that are scared of thinking games like this one.What I love of this game is that it is a cooperative game. Everybody wins or everybody dies.There are quite a bit of rules but if you take it one step at a time it isn't hard and many people pick it up quickly. If you can read and follow rules then you can play. There is a set of easier family set of rules and game play that is easier for beginners and there are advanced rules that add more dynamics to the game. The advanced game play adds characters with special jobs that help or hinder you. The advanced game play also adds hazardous material that could explode and it also adds the use of the firetruck.  Flashpoint has very high replay value. Every game is different.My family has mostly played the Family set of rules because we seem to introduce this to many different people and so those are easier to start out with.  One family that was introduced want to play it again because they think of new strategies to play.There are two sides to the board so there are two house layouts. One side is way harder than the other side because there are less doors that lead to outside. This game really makes you think about your own house layout and if it is safe and what should we do in case of a fire.It really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you get to save one of the victims in the house. It can make someone tense and even sad if we lose one of the victims. We really get into the game. It makes us think that we should be grateful that we aren't really in this situation for real and also makes us have deeper respect for real firefighters.The game pieces are nice; the art is amazing. But there wasn't any way to keep them neat after you pop them out of the cardboard they came in. So we have been putting them back into the cardboard holder that they came in. It is a puzzle game after the game to fit them in the correct spot. So that is fine but I don't know what we are going to do when they get too loose to be securely held in place.We always have good fun playing this with varying age groups. My family laughs at me every time because I'm now known as the one that wants to break down the walls. We actually died at least once because I chopped down a wall and the house collapsed on us. Not in that order; there were just too many explosions.Funny tidbit: One time I went to save one of the victims and I turn over the piece to see if it was a victim or not and I wondered, ""Why are we saving the coffee pot?""  The picture was upside down and it was actually the dog.

Great cooperative game for families and gamers
","

  My family and I love this game. This game helped us realize that cooperative games are best for our family- otherwise the kids (8 and 13 yo) get too competitive with one another and game night turns ugly. (Pandemic was also a success)Flash Point is a cooperative (team) game for 2-6 players that plays in about 30 minutes. We've played the Family level 4-5 times so far and won each time - but only barely. the last time we played we did add a bunch of rules from the Expert level, but now we are ready to make it even tougher. I introduced this to my adult game group last week and they all enjoyed it, too. i haven't tried any of the expansions yet because I think we have a lot more plays to come from the base game still. There is definitely a level of randomness to the game (advancing fire), but the game still plays very well for us.

  Saturday, January 26th. Played with my wife Anna, and three of my children, Patience, Charity and Gentry. Super fun game, but there never was any danger of us losing so if we play again then we‚Äôll have to make it harder. It was still really fun. We played with the special ability cards which might have been what made it too easy for us. We never even encountered an explosion. Cassandra managed a double rescue in one turn which was really cool, and Patience was able to put out an incredible amount of fires with her character. Gentry saved us from trying to rescue fakes and Charity got her people out fast as the Paramedic. Looking forward to playing again on a harder level :)

  This game is flipping awesome, especially previously being an EMT.  I built up the excitement by watching YouTube videos and when I finally got it I played it 3 times in a row.  And it is hard, even on easy.  We won 1/3 games.  The mechanics of gameplay can take some time to learn because there is a lot going on but once everyone is on the same page the strategy and co-op really comes to life as you're racing to save victims, choosing between rescuing someone who is fairly safe, putting out a blazing fire that's destroying the house or removing hazardous material that's going to explode and kill a victim.  It gets crazy.  10/10 for sure and I'm super excited about the expansions.

  I am a heavy duty board game fan and have played many co-ops. This is my ""go to"" game for a co-op. What is a co-op board game? It is a game where the players work as a team to beat the board game. The game has several expansions which really expand on the playability of the game and they are reasonably priced, but the base game is replayable enough as it is. It has a double sided map (one more difficult than the other) and the game has three or four difficulty settings (family, rookie, veteran, etc.) as well, so if you find yourself beating the rookie level, maybe it is time for the veteran level.  Whenever I bring this game to my gaming group, there is a 90%that it gets to the table. That should tell you something.

Different Game every time.
","

  I've played with 3 different groups and solitaire mode so far.  Very flexible game, even without expansion packs.  Easy to learn basic game play and rules expand and change when your group is ready.  It is a very different game every time it is played because chance influences the fire much more than the players.  There are strategies that in general work better than others but a couple of bad rolls can lead to a collapsed building and a couple of lucky ones can lead to an easy win.  Lots of fun.

My five year old can't get enough
","

  We played this as a family today for the first time. Since our son is five, we gave ourselves 8 Action Points per turn instead of four to ensure he felt like he could make some progress. It's still very challenging, and we are loving it. He is playing with the board and pieces and using them to tell stories and go on adventures. We love it, and I love that it will grow with him and that we can still enjoy the more challenging adult rules.

I enjoy playing this game
","

  I'm fan of co-operative games, so that will bias my review some. I enjoy playing this game, but there is a lot to do and the rules are a little complex when playing with all of them. The game first recommends the ""family version"", that strips out a lot of the more detailed rules. This worked well for my seven year old daughter and I at the time. We used the recommendation in the back of the manual for slowly adding in a few more of the rules each time we played. My now-eight year old enjoys this game still, but not as much as others because of the extra complexity. She much prefers Forbidden Island over this one, but we still play this now and then.Playing with all rules on the normal difficulty on side A of the board was actually easy. We never lost one of those games and often decided to keep playing until we completely put the fire out. The last time we played we switched sides and bumped the difficulty up and we lost that game. I think that is the mode we will try to play on a few more times to see if it has the right challenge level.Maybe due to the extra complexity or due to it being a co-operative game and I only know competitive players, I have not managed to convince anyone else to play this game with me (and my daughter) yet.

great game for family and friends
","

  We got this game about 1-2 weeks ago and we love it!The game is exciting and fun for everyone. In case you didn't read the description, it's a cooperative board game about firefighters saving people from a burning building. Cooperative means everyone is on the same team playing against the fire. This game involves a lot of teamwork, strategizing and collaboration. To add to the strategy, players can choose a firefighter specialty.One of the nice things in this game is that it offers 4 difficulty levels, so you can start off easy and try for a challenge when you feel up to it. The easiest is the ""family"" version, then there's rookie, veteran and hero.I will say that the full rules seem a little intimidating at first, but we found progressively adding the advanced rules instead of jumping straight into it made it easier. We played the ""family"" version the first couple times, then the next time we played with the randomized set up for the advanced game and the rules from the ""family"" version, next game we added the Specialists and Hazmats, then finally we tried a game with all the rules. I definitely recommend following a similar progression, it gave me a chance to get familiar with a few rules at a time instead of all at once. Now I feel comfortable explaining the full rules to a new group of players.One note about this game's kid friendliness: My 5 year old can't quite grasp the strategies involved, but he loves the firefighter figures that come with the game. I'd say this game is good for ages 7 and up.Overall, I like this game because it offers a great mix of strategy and excitement. No one we've played it with so far has said anything bad about it. After playing through 6 times, the only thing I can think to complain about is that there are a lot of different pieces to keep sorted. For now I've put everything in ziploc bags, but I'm thinking about buying a small, clear plastic tacklebox to keep it all sorted.A nice bonus that surprised me is that the board is actually double-sided, you can play on either side.

Fun board game.

  Update after many months of owning this game: This game is still going strong in my house. We don't always play this game on our family nights but it does get played regularly in our rotation of games. We've moved on to more advanced rules and don't always win. I also like to throw in an exercise for my 9 year old niece by saying ""okay, you are in charge of this firefighting operation - what is the plan this round?"" It's an easy leadership exercise for her that she just loves. All in all, I am still glad I purchased this game.ONE WORD OF ADVICE FOR GAMING EXPERTS: If you play board games regularly and consider yourself a board gaming pro then I'd recommend skipping family rules. They won't challenge you. I'd recommend you skip straight to veteran difficulty.Original Week 1 review:I just got this two days ago, so this game still has that honeymoon period going for it, I'll try and come back after a month and update this review to see if my opinion has changed any.Sometimes you want to sit down with the people you care about and play a game with them. I purchased this game to do something with my niece other then play video games or watch movies with her. I choose this game because I've never played a coop board game before and I know my niece would get a thrill out of working with the adults to win the game.At first the rules seem a little complicated but after a game or two they become extremely easy to follow. That is to say, at least family rules are easy to follow. We haven't graduated to the experienced rule set but given how much we keep playing this game I suspect we will be moving to the experienced rule set very soon. Needless to say my niece, her dad, and I enjoy this game very much so far. Each play through is about 45 minutes total, you're mileage may very given there is a slight random element to this game between the fires and the point of interest.So far at the end of every game my niece asks if we can play it again, which means at the moment we've found something more fun then video games for her. All in all, I do not regret this purchase and I can't wait until my niece gets done with school today so she, her dad, and I can play another round of this game.Side note: I forgot to mention, the game recommends ages 10 and up, but if you focus on the family rule set you might be able to get away with 8 and up. At least my niece is 8 and she seems to be able to follow the game just fine. It depends on your kid, of course.

Surprisingly Fun
","

  My friends and I were concerned first time we started this game. We started going through the instruction manual, starting in the 'beginner' section, but... well to be blunt, we just wanted ot play.So we found a YouTube video. 30 minutes long. We watched all of it.  It made sense but we worried because it took 30 minutes to explain the rules. Apparently those were the advanced rules, so those are how we began playing.The rules are kind of complicated. There are lots of them.BUT! Once you start playing, or as long as 1 person at your table knows what they're doing, it moves along fast.And the game is super fast, super exciting. Every time you think you pushed the fire back something explodes or a victim gets killed.  First try we created the Permadeath houserule so if a fire-fighter gets knocked out then that specialist is dead for good (the player can choose a new specialist and respawn at the truck).  We almost won but all of our wall-chopping ended up being our undoing.Second time we got 7 victims out and there was an 8th one left. Me and another fire fighter decided to run in and save that last victim, even though we had already won, and the building collapsed on us.And that tends to be how the game goes for us. And it makes it a very different boardgame. The endings can be a bit anti-climatic because the goal isn't so set in stone, mainly because you want to play as much as you can. Even if that means putting yourself back into danger.But yeah. Point is- it's fun, Dynamic, great to teach to new people and great at creating cooperation.

Excellent Cooperative game
","

  My family really loves cooperative games. Games like Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot, Castle Panic and Forbidden Island are all hits at my house. With all the buzz around Flash Point Fire Rescue, I had to try it out. The game comes with two sets of rules, a basic ""family"" set of rules and the advanced rules. Basic rules are fun, but the advanced rules is where the strategy comes in.The premise is that you are a firefighter and you are rushing into the house to rescue people and animals. each person has a role that they play, but that can be switched during the game if another role would be more helpful. The game can be very intense as the fire continues to burn and flare up as you play.Overall, this game really fits the coop bill perfectly and it's been a hit in our family. I'd recommend it if you enjoy cooperative games and want to pretend you're a fire fighter!

  This game is great.  My 8, 10 & 15 year old really enjoy it.  I've been trying to get them into actual board games (sorry console people, there is value playing games face to face) but it has been a challenge.  This one is a Cooperative game where everyone is working together to save the people from the fire.  Unlike other games that sometimes end with someone upending the game board and walking out of the room, this one sets a positive family game night environment.  Save the victims before the building collapses and too many victims are lost to fire or you lose.  There are variable rules that can be modified to add challenge to the game plus the expansion packs are good for a new look and different challenge.  I highly recommend this game.

4-Alarm Fire
","

  This board game is the kind of board game you bring out after everyone is finished killing each other over Risk.This is a co-op board game meaning everyone works together against the game itself to try to rescue victims trapped in a burning building from their fiery fate. The rules are relatively simple for the simple setup and get crazier and more complicated as the intensity increases. Each person gets a turn and at the end of their turn the game takes its turn in the form of a dice roll to expand the fire on the board. It's a lot of fun... as long as all of the pieces are there.I had purchased this a while ago, but because of timing was unable to really play it until recently. I noticed when I opened the box that the dice were missing, which I emailed them and they immediately replaced it at no cost. Upon my first play through I also realized that the damage counters were missing. I haven't emailed them, but it has been some time since I purchased it, so we will see how this flies. I would have given this game five stars, because the gameplay is great, and fun, however two missing pieces to a game can cause a lot of confusion and frustration which may already be high due to other more competitive games.If you like co-op, family friendly games (just don't mention that the poor dog got burned up in the fire) buy this, and enjoy. Only thing to watch out for is missing pieces.

  This has quickly become on of my family and friends favorite board game.  The game has 4 levels of challenge, two different board setups (one easier) and several optional rules that make it able to adjust to the level of play.  And the challenge is intense, some games the fire is just out of control and the team has to scramble to do everything possible to try and finish.  Amazing game, we can play it with my 6 year old daughter with the family setup or with a group of friends on one of the more advanced setups.

  If you are a Pandemic player looking for something new, GET THIS GAME! Personally I think this game on the hardest setting is more challenging and enjoyable than Pandemic. I still really love Pandemic, this is not a replacement by any means. But enough about Pandemic, lets talk about Flash Point!Each turn fire spreads, the building is damaged (usually), and players try to manage the fire and rescue victims. There are specialty ""role cards"" but everyone is very much engaged each round. You don't find yourself sitting in one spot ""for the better of the team"" much in this game.This game scales wonderfully and can be fun for all ages and experience levels depending on the setup. The expansions are cheap and bring great variety to the game as well, but, the base game has extreme replay value. I cannot recommend it enough.

  Cooperative games like Flash Point really make a whole group of people light up.  This game really puts a nice spin on things, too.  You play as the good guys, risking your lives to save lives.  Each step towards your goal feels good, even though the board is getting bleaker with every explosion and new hot spot.  There is always something to do, the mechanics are new and easy to understand.  There is very little about this game that I don't like.  If I had to find a negative it would be with the bits, of which there are a considerable amount.  I got a little plastic tacklebox organizer thing and dropped all the cardboard pieces in.  Now it's organized and neat.  You should get this game and play it with friends.

  This game can either be family-with-young-kids friendly, or as difficult and hardcore as you want it to be. It's really fun and versatile that way. This game also has a fantastic theme. You're the good guy firefighters! You're saving people, pets, putting out fires... It's great, and it's really an easy theme to get in the mood of.I play this game with my husband and friends, and have played it twice with my 3 and 5 year old children. The 3 year old is a bit young for this level game, but she gets taking turns, moving spaces, and rolling dice. My 5 year old understands more what's going on, what the mechanics at work are doing, and she plays her own moves about more than half the time. It's a co-operative game, of course. But when I'm playing with adults we're all participating in the strategy of the game. My 3 year old participates in the strategy not at all; my 5 year old is about halfway from not at all and what the adults and I are doing. I hope that makes sense.It's a super fun game, easy to introduce friends new to gaming, and I've even played it alone a few times. 10/10 would recommend to a friend

A Good Co-Operative Game
","

  There's a lot to really like about Flashpoint, it's one of the better applications of a theme in a board game I've seen. But how much you like Flashpoint will really depend on how you feel about co-operative games. Very much like Forbidden Island or Forbidden Desert, players are playing together to beat the game, not each other.Co-Operative gaming is  a nice change from some of the ultra competitive player vs player games we play, so in that space it's nice. But game play sometimes is clunky, with some rounds quickly getting out of hand, while others are easily beat. While we enjoy playing Flashpoint, it doesn't get a lot of play. It's rarely a game anyone suggests, and I think that speaks to the core of it. It's a good game, but not one that keeps you coming back for more.

The only issue I had was that we constantly had ""what-if"" questions as we played, and had to keep referring to the rulebook to double check, and still weren't totally sure we were playing correctly. Maybe it just had a steeper learning curve than I'm used to.Overall, really good game and a lot of fun. Took 2 players about an hour and a half to play one game, and we enjoyed it a lot!Family game? I would say not so much. Better for teens and up. Definitely a good game for ""game night"" if you have serious people that can stick with it. Compared to Pandemic, I felt this was a little more involved (in my opinion, I'm sure others would feel differently).

There are strategies to choose (do I rescue people or focus on the fire?), and during the game everyone 'helps' out with the way to proceed.  You aren't just staring at the board, you are working together, planning everyone's next move and helping and cheering others along!  Very refreshing from the typical ""I win, You lose"" game.

Nonetheless, I have played this game dozens (or what feels like hundreds) of times and I know a thing or two about it.1) Are you someone who enjoys long, drawn out, complicated, convoluted, games of mild strategy/mostly luck? You have no where else you need to be for the next 4 hours? Really?? Sad. If so, this game is for you, proceed to the next step.2) Be sure to look up the revised rules, as the current rule book has tons of inaccuracies and some of the haunts make absolutely no sense.3) Read everything multiple times. Got a number in your head? No, more than that. EVEN. MORE. Good. Now you'll still be confused but at least you'll be confused with the correct information.4) Consider wearing costumes. It really livens things up.5) Play on a large surface. The house will grow in every imaginable direction, there will be cards and dead bodies everywhere. It's a mess, make sure you have the space for it.

Great Game, Poor Quality
","

  I would like to start by saying that Betrayal is one of my all time favorite games. If I'm rating this based on the overall gameplay, I would give it a 4/5 stars. Only 4 stars because, as many other reviewers have mentioned, there are many haunts that are lacking details that can make the gameplay rather confusing.My main issue related to this game is the quality of the game and pieces. All of the small monster/item/etc token pieces require you to punch out the pieces from a large sheet. A large portion of my pieces ripped and tore when punching them out. Additionally, a room tile and character card have some small tears on them. The characters are all made of cheap plastic. One of them was not set properly and leans so much it barely stands up. I have some friends that own an older version of the game and it is of much higher quality than the game I received. I should also mention that the actual game box has started peeling. I have only had this game for 2 weeks now and it already looks like its been heavily played for years.I do want to mention that I reached out to Avalon Hill about the torn game pieces and they are sending me replacement pieces. The customer service was great, but the actual replacement parts are going to take 5-6 weeks to ship to me. It's rather disappointing for a new game that is rather expensive to buy. I expected higher quality. I can only hope that the replacement pieces are better than the originals that I received.Gameplay - 4/5 starsGame Quality - 1/5 starsAvg Rating - 3/5 stars

  Betrayal is one of my top favorite board games that I'm constantly trying to get my friends to play. It's a fun, challenging game that's really enjoyable with the right group of people.It's an exploration/board building game with an eerie theme about it and a really unique mechanic.Players begin by choosing a character -- one of 12, each of which have their own set of stats. Then players enter the house, flipping cards to uncover rooms to build out the mansion. Rooms can contain special events, items (like weapons, armor, or occult paraphernalia), or omens. Which are bad.Whenever an omen is found, the player that found it must roll the die and roll more than the number of omens that have currently been found. If a player fails to roll more than the number of omens, then THE HAUNT BEGINS. At this point, the instruction book is consulted which will tell you which haunt scenario to follow based on the conditions that caused it to occur. Usually one player is named the betrayer and is given their on set of instructions to follow (I suggest you make them leave the room) while the rest of the explorers plan their strategy to defeat them.There are around 30 different scenarios you can play out, which means that you can play several different unique stories. The flavor text of all the cards is pretty entertaining, so things are best if everyone can get into it when they're reading to the group.Overall it's a really fun game that can be enjoyed by both seasoned board gamers and beginners.

No one wants to end up a monster ... or do they ?!?!?

  In our attempt to preserve family time within  our family we have board game night every Thursday. This began when the children were little and has remained a fun family tradition into the children‚Äôs 20‚Äôs.As with anything the games have evolved from CandyLand to Risk, Axis and Allies and now this.We have already played it three times and enjoy it every time.Pros: The concept is great, it‚Äôs enganging , unique board design, high variety of outcomes , the cooperative concept can change to player VS player changing the dynamic and creating quantifiable fun, it can be a long or short game depending on the variables and it covers our need to include all of our age groups for entertainment value.Cons: Being the ‚Äúmonster ‚Äú  can be confusing as the literature (instruction book) is not written for beginners, although variable scenarios are possible it can quickly become familiar leaving the surprise aspect absent, limited card selection (we are already buying the additional pack at roughly $19.00)  so this could be intentional as a way to upsell the product. (Brilliant marketing strategy)As a tool in our parental tool box to combat the digital age and losing touch with our children on a very personal level this is a great addition and will be played for many years.Other facts to know:The players build the game board as they go and this can demand a large playing area.Game cards will scratch if played on a rough surface. We play on a stone dining table and this has occurred.The ‚Äúmonster scenarios‚Äù are all different and in our expierence thus far - it appears everyone wants to be the monster.It costs less to buy this than the amount you would spend to take the whole family to one movie, you could play this for many evenings.Enjoy and ‚Äúgame on‚Äù!

  We got this for Christmas in hopes it would be a fun monster like game. Instead it us packed full of evil such as a possession, demons, a ouji board, a pentagram etc.  I advise no one to purchase this game. Ours is currently sitting in the garbage at the end of the driveway.

Difficult to learn at first! Great Fun! Best for 4+ players! New fun every time!
","

  This game is a lot of fun, but it is hard to learn. The directions can be somewhat confusing-especially if you are new to the game. It is so much easier to have someone who knows how to play to explain it to you as you go! I'll do a quick synopsis to demonstrate:One of the difficult parts to learn was what ""The Haunt"" and ""Monster Roll"" was. The haunt is basically where the game changes.The monster roll is the turn of the monster (whatever monster is activated) during the haunt.Basically, you & your group enter a haunted house. Roll the dice to see how many rooms/steps you take. You start off with just the entryway-you ""discover"" rooms as you go. This means you grab a board piece that corresponds to whatever floor you are on and add it to the board where you are.Once you enter a room, some will have a symbol on the room & it will direct you to pick up a card & read/follow the directions on it.It's best to discover as many rooms as possible before the haunt is activated. *The haunt is activated by a dice roll.During the haunt: One person will take on an extra role of being the monster. The other players will try to defeat the monster.See? Not too hard, but unless you read the whole booklet very carefully, you might not understand fully.  It took 3 of us fumbling thru one game, then kinda knowing what we were doing during the second. Then we some-what mastered it on the 3rd round.It is ok with just 3 players, but way more fun with 4 or more!It has a great re-play ability to it. Each time things will change-rooms, monsters, items you have, etc.Overall, this is a great game. It has a learning curve in the beginning, but you can catch on quickly after that. Like I said, having at least one person to help the others walk thru it, makes it way more fun & easy to learn! It's not a quick game-if you take your time & especially if you are new, it will take at least an hour to play!We paid $31 + tax for it and it was worth it. Hopefully, they will make a new addition with easier to understand directions. I'd also like to see it take longer to activate the haunt. It is fun exploring the rooms & lots of times we only have a few before the haunt!

Great game for Casual Family.
","

  My family is pretty much casual gamers- although we enjoy games like Settlers and Pandemic, we just don't seem to have the time or endurance to learn longer, more complex games. Being a big horror fan, I've been wanting to get this for years, but put it off for that reason. This year I broke down and got it, and we're been loving it. It's really not that hard, and is a lot of fun. My 11-yr-old daughter can't get enough of it, and takes the betrayal very seriously. The first part of the game is easy: Just move through the house, exploring tiles and experiences minor challenges. Then the Haunt is revealed: One of 50 Random stories. Each of these plays like a slightly different game using the same rules as the first part. It's a lot of fun, and challenging.

So much good horror fun!
","

  We've had a LOT of fun with this game. Mechanics are pretty simple: you pick a character and ""explore"" an old house, by going through doorways to reveal new rooms. You then pick a new room tile from the stack of tiles and lay it out, connecting it to the doorway you just passed through. Most rooms have either an event, an item, or an omen in them. If so, your turn ends and you collect an event or item or omen card. These cards are fun and sometimes you get benefits, sometimes bad things happen to you.Eventually, once enough omen cards have been selected, something called ""the haunt"" begins. At that point one of the players turns traitor! He or she then goes off and reads the haunt instructions from a booklet, while the remaining players read different haunt instructions from another booklet. Both players and traitor get instructions on how to win the game. This is totally cool. Sometimes your foe is a ghost, sometimes a mummy, sometimes it's the house itself seemingly come to life! The clock starts ticking then, as you have a certain number of turns to win by.Just remember one thing: the rules are there to help, not to drive you nuts. If something is unclear you can ask in many online places (including here on Amazon) but remember to keep playing even when confused about a rule. Decide what you think the rule means and go for it! If you later on find out that you didn't do the rule correctly, just play it ""right"" the next time. Or stick to your own interpretation. It's a game, and it's FUN. Enjoy!Now where did I leave my holy water...

  We purchased two of these games to give as gifts, we decided to open one early and play it to see how it was. We were shocked and appalled when the instructions of the game told us to begin chanting and pray to all that is unholy and evil!  This is disgusting. Do not buy this garbage. Its is marketed as a fun, mystery, suspense but it is pure garbage. I could not get this box of evil out of my house fast enough and on a UPS truck back to Amazon!

Fun but LOTS of RULES
","

  This is a really fun game, but very involved with LOTS of rules. We have had a few arguments on the interpretation of the rules and decided we needed to take a break from playing this game for awhile. You can't do ""XX"", but you can do this if XX type situations and gets really confused. This is a really a 2 part game. First part you all are exploring the house and having fun building and surviving the unexpected twists each room provides. Then, based on certain conditions, the haunt begins (part 2) and suddenly one of you is the bad guy (traitor)  and going after the other explorers (heroes). It is the heroes job to prevail and defeat the traitor, and the traitors job to destroy all (depending on the haunt). There are 50 haunts with different rules. Which haunt you get depends on the room in which it was triggered and the Omen card drawn. Overall, very fun game but requires a lot of mental work to learn.

Fun and Variable for Experienced Gamers, but a Little Complicated and Creepy for Beginners or Kids
","

  Let's start with THE GOOD NEWS: I'm personally a big fan of this game! It's basically like putting yourself in the middle of every horror movie you've ever seen or heard about. If you like horror movies, then you'll like this game! If not, probably give it a pass. I'm a pretty experienced board-gamer and like many aspects of its gameplay, especially the many ways in which the game is almost never the same each time you play it (see details below.) However, Betrayal is also a very detailed and complicated game that I wouldn't necessarily recommend for beginning gamers or children. Here are some highlights:GAME DESCRIPTION: As I mentioned above, the game essentially places players into the middle of every horror movie that's ever been written. The game has two phases: 1- Exploring the House, and 2- The Haunt. At first, everyone works together while you play as a band of assorted characters who are exploring your way through a haunted house, revealing haunted room after haunted room. While exploring the house, players collect artifacts that make them stronger. Eventually, however, one player stumbles across an item that triggers the second phase, The Haunt. During the Haunt, you're trying to deal with whatever monster/spirit/other horrifying problem emerges to haunt the house (there are 50 different Haunts to play in the game, depending on how exactly The Haunt is triggered). Often, the player that triggers the haunt turns on the other players (i.e., becoming a werewolf or something) and the other players need to either band together to bring them down or be destroyed. The game ends when either ""the haunter"" or ""the haunted"" complete the task assigned to them in The Haunt!VERY FUN FOR EXPERIENCED GAMERS: In my opinion the best part of Betrayal is the HUGE variability it contains. Every single aspect of the game changes from one round to another: you can choose different starting characters each time (who come equipped with different abilities [strength, speed, etc.]), the haunted house is never the same twice since you reveal rooms from a shuffled stack piece-by-piece, you discover different items each time, and the huge selection of Haunts makes it so that you almost never have to replay them (I've played this game many times, and have yet to repeat Haunts)! Also, the game is made all the more fun because of its immersive, creepy vibe. There are some Haunts that I like more than others, but the feeling of being stuck in a horror movie with your fellow players is pretty pervasive and entertaining. You'll love it!NOT FOR BEGINNER GAMERS: As fun as this game is, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to beginner gamers. The game is very complicated, and takes a close reading and re-reading of the rules to play it right. Also, it has lots of fiddly little pieces that, if lost, can really disrupt gameplay. My biggest complaint about the game is that the rules for The Haunt aren't always clear, and you kind of have to decide as a group what the ""rules of engagement are"" in situations where disagreements arise. This is exacerbated by the fact that only The Haunter is allowed to read their instructions, while The Haunted read their own. If you are a beginning player and want to give this a try, I recommend you find someone who already knows how to play and have them walk you through it. Or do a video tutorial!NOT NECESSARILY FOR CHILDREN: Finally, because of the horror-based foundation of the game, I wouldn't recommend it for children. Some of The Haunts are pretty creepy, and I wouldn't want to be responsible for recommending anything that might cause nightmares! I'd say that the game creators' recommendation of ""Ages 12+"" is appropriate.Bottom line: I'll return to play this game many, many more times in the future, and hope that you'll enjoy playing it too. Happy haunting!

Very Good for What It Is

  Do you like board games? Do you have friends and family who also like board games? Do you like roleplaying elements, but never knew how to enjoy these with those same friends and family? Then this game is a very good match for you. I do some tabletop roleplaying and things like that, and I like board games. My family are not roleplayers, but they like board games. I bought this for my dad this Christmas so that we could all play together as a family.There is a little bit of a learning curve. There are lots of different pieces and chips and all of that sort of thing. However, there's a good guide on Youtube that helps understand things a lot quicker, and with that and a quick trial game, you should be good to go.Everyone enjoyed this game. My sister does not like board games, and we got her to play it multiple times in one night. My brother and his girlfriend wanted to get their own copy to play at home. The roleplaying elements are as light or heavy as you want to make them, so it's an easy, accessible game for your more 'normie' gamers.My dad loves board games and he often has a hard time getting anyone else to play with him. That was not a problem with House on the Hill. Four games in one night, and ""a near-perfect day"" for my dad means this gets 5 stars from me.

10 Lessons learned by a First Timer
","

  I am happy to report that quality of construction issues many reviewers reported have been fixed. So that's a plus. But here are some things I learned from playing this game the first time with my family.1) the rulebook is an encyclopedia smeared with mud - metaphorically of course. But it is thick and obscure and honestly leaves you with more questions than answers.2) there are LOTS of dice but no clear indication of how many to roll.  So we decided that when it say 4+ it meant roll 4 dice.  No clue if this is right but it was just a way to move forward and stop flipping through the book.3)before the haunt - the only point is to collect cards and earn skills. That's it. So don't put too much thought into that part. Just collect cards and build skills or you will die almost immediately after the haunt.4) the Monsters- good grief could the actual directions be any less clear about this?  What we think is that different haunts use different monsters and the traitor will be given the directions as to what monster and how.  Our particular haunt had no monsters which caused us to constantly be questioning why we weren't using them and our traitor was  really frustrated because the haunt scenario didn't mention them so we had no idea.5) there is stuff in the box you may not use - they put tons of stuff in there because some haunts need x and others need y so you have x and y in the box. Don't let it confuse/frustrate you. This of course is my theory based on our one experience - which was extremely confusing and frustrating.6)when you become a master player the game may take an hour....but for the rest of us - it takes MUCH much longer. Most of which is spent reading rules and trying to interpret them.7) the item cards are things you can use when you attack or battle things later.  I have no idea about these because we fumbled our way through the haunt which seemed random so we never actually used our items and only had a couple of attacks because we really had no idea what we were doing.  We couldn't understand the nomenclature enough to strategize nor did we know what they were talking about....for example, ""add 2 if you have the madman in the library and the music book and someone has the music skill""  Um.....what madman?  What music book? Does the someone with the music skill need to be the one rolling the dice or is it any member of the team? What if two members have the skills, do we get double the points?  Turns out - some of these are cards or chits you may earn. So when you read things you don't understand - assume they are cards/chits you will eventually find.  That does of course make strategizing harder.  Some of it you just have to make house rules for. So we decided any person on team could have the skill and if more than one had it we got double the points.  Who knows if we are right but it at least ended the debate and moved us forward.8) give up trying to figure out the rules and make your own where there is conflict/confusion (which is often). You will have a better experience if you just make a decision and move on rather than spend an hour flipping through the book only to not find what you need. Trust me on this one.  Flip a coin, accept the decision and move on. Or you will all be miserable.9) there are YouTube videos.  Seriously! Watch one before attempting this game, it will really help you at least have a clue what you are doing.10) several reviewers say you need to play 3 times before deciding what you really think. I am going to trust them because I really wanted to like it but found it a quagmire of confusion and frustration. So we are going to attempt it again (after watching the YouTube video).Honestly, after the first time through I actually threw the game to name the traitor the winner because I just wanted it to be over. I boxed the game up and planned to give it to Goodwill. I logged in to write a review and instead read lots and lots of other reviews and then decided to give it another try not worrying so much about ""the rules"" and just going with the gist of the idea - which makes for a MUCH better experience.  I'll let you know how that goes.  If it fails - I am burning this stupid game.

Publisher needs to put out more detailed and clearer haunt rules
","

  I love the idea of this game. I have no issue with the material or tokens or anything other than the apparent lack of playtesting of the haunts. One minor problem is that most haunts seem to clearly favor the traitor or the heroes and it's demoralizing when it's pretty apparent very soon after the haunt is revealed which side is going to win.The bigger problem, however, is that most of the haunts are not written well. The haunt-specific rules are often unclear and ambiguous and the many resulting questions quickly bring the game to a frustrating and screeching halt, especially if the traitor is a player new to the game. I would urge the publisher to review all of the haunts, playtest them properly and publish more detailed haunt explanations online to make the game much more enjoyable.

Very dark game + demonic content + not suitable for families

  Our family LOVES strategy board games, and we were very excited about this purchase to play during quarantine. I read through all the rules, watched a YouTube video to help with set up, and was ready to sit down and figure out the many elements of the game we supposed would make it fun. We were enjoying the board set up and building the house, but as soon as we got to ‚Äúthe haunt‚Äù, we closed the booklets and threw the game away. The game has extremely dark content not suitable for family play and not advisable for any age. If we are going to spend four hours of our time as a family playing a game, it will not be one so demented and morally dubious.

Fun for more experienced, role-play gamers

  This game is definitely a longer one, and has a dark/scary feel. (Not just cute halloween, but definitely haunted house) The idea of having many different outcomes, a board that slowly unfolds, or characters that can change sides is great! but the first play is VERY long. It may be worth youtubing to learn gameplay.Especially if you end up being the traitor in the group... you essentially get an additional booklet of instructions/rules that you need to play as the bad guy, and others involved in the game can't help you too much, or you lose strategy. If you're not a more experienced board gamer, or at least ready to do lots of reading, this may be too much for you or your friends.That being said, after you learn how the game basically operates, it may become easier the next time you play?The only thing I would say is that there were sometimes we as a group really had to search through the manuals (yes there is multiple) to figure out how to do certain parts of gameplay...I.e. how many times can I actually do damage to this monster in one turn?If that could be made clearer and simpler, it would really go far.Note: I do not have the updates to the game people in the comments are talking about, like the player boards etc.

  I gave the game a 5 star review because it's got it where it counts: fun factor. Here's my overall impression of the game.**Gameplay: 5 stars**We all have a blast playing the game! Just when the exploring starts to become dull, the game switches to a survival game where anything can happen. The random unpredictability keeps all of us on our toes.**Board Pieces: 4 stars**The board pieces aren't warped yet for our game, and I hope it never happens. The artwork is great and the sliding counters fit perfectly. The cards are high quality and fun.**Figurines: 2 stars**These were the biggest disappointments for me. They are very low quality and the faces look warped and inhuman. It was hard for us to distinguish a few pieces apart because of their low quality. If I had a collection of other figurines, I'd be very tempted to use them.**Instruction Manual: 3 stars**Although they did a good job trying to explain the gameplay for a quirky, random game like this, our group was left with almost as many questions as we had answers. We looked up as much as we could, even searched online, but in the end had to come up with some reasonable house rules.**Replay-ability: 5 stars**The random nature of the game means you'll be playing it a lot!As I said before, this game has got it where it counts. Even though it's not a perfect game by any means, it is so much fun I forgive it for its faults. Get it, play it a few times, enjoy it. That's what gaming is all about.

Great game, not so great figurines
","

  Let me start by saying that this is a 2/5 as opposed to a 5/5 for the pieces received and customer service received, NOT for the game itself. I highly recommend this game to any board game collector or player that wants co-op tabletop and group play.The reason I marked low on my review is because of the game figurines we received with the purchase. While the materials are acceptable I received 2 of the same figure (the little girl in yellow) and was missing the little boy figure from the game. Not unusable...then I unwrapped them and noticed 3 of the 6 pieces were horribly leaning, and while they did manage to balance upright the appearance they give is not of the highest quality. Before writing this review I contacted Wizards of the Coast hoping they could at least replace the missing figurine and I could leave a proper review and show the replacement piece...unfortunately the piece we received was not at all close to the character in the game, nor does it look like it belongs in the same set of figurines. While this game is not unplayable by any means, having pieces that match are what make a game feel complete. The service I received from Wizards of the Coast has, in the past, always been great. This time, unfortunately, I received an automated reply telling me they would send a replacement piece and then received this (image 3).I am sad to leave a less than deserved review because I have been a fan of WotC products and this is the first time I have had a real complaint with them. However, after seeing that these pieces are a recurring issue with this game I am surprised that they have not re-cast pieces, or at least ensured that the sets are properly packaged/assembled before sealing and shipping.I hope future products and purchases are of the standard I usually see from this company.

  Super fun game. I usually play with my D&D group, but once I pulled it out for a house party when I was trying to entertain some teenagers. Now they're the sort to fight and scream in a way that kinda ruins a game, even with other really fun tabletop games. I'm all for getting loud and having banter in a game, but not in a way that leaves half of the group feeling exhausted and thinking that they didn't have fun. Surprisingly, that didn't happen with this game. They were all engaged and enjoying themselves. If one of them got too rowdy, the others were quick to calm them down because they were all having a good time. Played it with them on other occasions, and since they understood how to play, it only went more smoothly. Like, I thought this game was fun before, but I like it more after that experience.

Tons of fun, but a giant hassle

  As fun as this game is (which it is a ton of fun) there are so many small tokens and pieces that you have to keep track of and no real way to organize them.  You can buy an organizer for $30, but that's something the game should come with, not something I have to pay for.  Need the smoke token?  Ok, give me 5 minutes to sort through the pile of tokens to find it.  And there are games where you'll need multiple tokens too.  I really just wish this was better organized.  Also, the character cards suck, but there are plenty of third party apps for tracking characters that make it easier to deal with.  This game is so close to being 5 stars, but it's just missing so many little basic things that it really shouldn't that I even honestly struggle to give it a 4 star.  The actual game itself is a blast and a fan favorite at game night, but it's such a cluster to deal with because the lack of organization

Amazing However Confusing at Points
","

  This is one of my favorite games to play on game night. It is a unique cooperative game, unless you become the traitor the it is a unique game where you massacre your friends and laugh at them. This game comes with 50 different scenarios and I have still yet to play them all. The first play through takes a little bit of extra time to get the basic rules down but then runs smoother after you have a game under your belt. It usually takes an hour per play through. My friends ask to play this all the time.Even though this is one of my favorites, I docked it a star because the rules can be confusing on each scenario. Some are straight forward while other scenarios are poorly written. It can take quite a while to figure out your objective whether you‚Äôre the heroes or the traitor. Even though I have played this a ton, I still play with the rules right next to me so I can figure things out. Finally, my last knock on this game is the plastic character trait tabs are too big for the cards. They don‚Äôt hold their position well so it is easy to mess up what your traits are.Overall, despite this game being confusing at points it is a rare must have if you like to play games in groups of people. I have played this with my family (including parents that don‚Äôt understand strategy games) and with my nerdy friends who play tons of strategy games. Everyone loves it.

  I have bought tons of board games, but this is the first one that the wife said the night after we played it for the first time- hey would you guys like the play the game again tonight? I was blown away. The game does have some issues, but overall it is fun and engaging. There aren't a ton of actions per turn and play seems to move quickly until you get to the haunt. Once at the haunt, the game does slow considerably as you try to figure out what the new rules for the game are.Some minor quibbles- the rules are ambiguous at times, especially during the haunt. There is help online, if needed. The suggested age is the first place where I could say that you should listen to it. Younger players could play fin up to the haunt, but once the haunt begins, that falls away. A lot of responsibility and intuition falls to the traitor to figure out their part. if they are too young or just can't get things normally, then the haunt will fall apart. One of my 12 year olds just couldn't grasp the intricacies of the haunt and we eventually just gave up that scenario.

A Great Game for People Who Love Games

  I've played Betrayal before at friends' houses, but this time I bought it for my dad, who has a huge, ever-expanding board game collection and was looking for something new and unique.This game is exciting, spooky, and incredibly suspenseful. I wouldn't recommend it for beginners, as there are a lot of mechanics and possibilities and the way you play the game can change in a moment. But for friends and families who like to play board games pretty often, Betrayal is a perfect way to shake things up.I think I'd compare it to the game Mansions of Madness, except Betrayal is a lot easier to understand and faster to play.I think its best feature is that it's a really dynamic game and everything is designed so that you can play over and over again and still get a totally different experience every time. For example, you and your friends explore the titular house on the hill by placing room tiles as you encounter them, so the map will always look wildly different with each session. This base game also comes with dozens of story scenarios that are triggered randomly by play, and each scenario is adaptable so that the ""traitor"" can be a different player every time or even that there can be no traitor at all, meaning you never know who is suddenly going to turn on the rest of the group after you've just spent the first half of the game trusting (and giving weapons to--uh oh!) each other.

  51 games in 1! The base game starts as everyone exploring/building the house while encountering spooky things and helpful items. Eventually the haunt will start, and then things get crazy. Someone becomes a traitor, and they leave to read their traitor rules while the good guys read their new rules. There are 50 separate haunt scenarios possible. They are chosen depending on the 'Omen' card you drew and the room you are in when the haunt starts.This game can be really short, or really long. I don't think it has ever lasted more than 3 hours for my group of 4-5. It really depends on when the haunt starts (random) and if the haunt has even sides between the good and bad people. Most of the time, one side is seriously stronger than the other. But that all depends on when the haunt starts and what people have found by then. It stays fun by being unpredictable.The instructions are a bit iffy with respect to some things... but it is fine overall. They need to work on the rulebook and make things more clear. Lastly I will say that the component quality is very good. Everything looks well made. Go ahead and grab the expansion for an added level to the house and 50 more haunts!

  I was a little worried about how my family would receive this game. But now I'm so glad I bought it! We've played it multiple times over the last few days and we still love it. Our players were aged between 15 and 50 years old.Pros: although the reading the rulebook seemed daunting, we all picked up the rules very quickly. Even during the exploring half, there was always something happening to keep us engaged. The game is made to be slightly different every time, which keeps it from getting stale. My teenage siblings were begging to play again. All the pieces are very good quality and the rules were easy to understand.Cons: VERY dark themes and a little scary. When my toddler was in the room, we didn't read our cards out loud. And when we played it at night, we had to play another goofy game before we went to bed. I wish it had a lighter tone so it would appeal to a broader age range.Overall, we really love this game and think it deserves all 5 stars.

  We love this game.  We've played it so many times, and every time is different.  There are still so many haunts that we haven't experienced yet.  the replay value of this game is outstanding.  Very fun to get spooked out with friends on game night.The rules are not too complicated, so it's easy for those who are not as familiar with these types of games to get into.  The interesting scenarios and unfolding story keeps everyone attentive.  It's probably not a good game to play in a distracting environment, such as a large party or while a movie is playing, but it's engaging enough that no one is bored.Also, download the character sheet app in iTunes and Google Play.  It works a lot better than the little black clips that slide up and down the edges of the character cards.

This game is a big collection of B horror movies
","

  There's a ""traitor"", but it's not a traitor mechanic if that makes sense. Yo spend the game walking through the house, collecting treasures, piecing together rooms, building the mansion and story setting.  Along the way, you will be gravely hurt, injured, scarred, and your stats will either go up or down.When ""it"" happens and your spooky dice hit their roll, you each disband and do your best to learn the right rules of the game. Each of you has a win condition, so you're kept secret because knowing the win condition makes it easier to stop the other team.This is where knowing some horror movie tropes comes in. You can piece a few things here and there together and try to incorporate that into a strategy, but really this game comes down mainly to whoever ""wins"" the dice roll that indicates your shift to traitoring.I'd recommend you get the baldur's gate version as well btw. This gets old and the DND setting of the other makes it more timeless.

  ¬†My brother loves board games so we decided to all play this with him for his birthday.  The first time was rough.  It takes a while to learn how to play, so we spent over an hour trying to play and figure it out our first game.  But once we learned it, it actually is simple.  We played again with my teenage nieces and they loved it.  We played twice in a row.Watch a YouTube video to learn how to play it.  It works best if this is new to everyone, learn how to play it by yourself and then guide your friends and family through their first play.There are a lot of scenarios and it changes the game play every time.  I love that all the characters are African American.  It allows my family to have a game that represents everyone better.I recommend it of you are tired of all the games you have and want a fun immersive experience.

Awesome game, 100% recommend it

  I've played this game for YEARS and it has yet to get old. Yes, it can be complicated at first and maybe a bit overwhelming, but it is very easy once you get the gist of it. Every round is different--the game comes with 50 different storylines that are initiated randomly during each round by triggering the ""Haunt"". You can also get expansions that add even more stories.Something really cool about this game is that you build the board as you go! There are room tiles which are drawn during each person's turn.My only complaint is that the items and events get repeated a lot from game to game. There just don't seem to be enough cards. That can get kind of old, but that's really the only ""repetitive"" part about it. The rest is a big surprise!I 100% would recommend this game to anyone who wants to bring excitement to their weekly gamenights. You won't be disappointed!P.S. download the app to keep track of character stats. It's a lot easier than the cards the game comes with.

Engaging game, but rules are not 100% well designed

  I really don't like scary things. So it was a stretch for me to enjoy this game.It was fun trying to get stronger and exploring the house -- even as an atmosphere of fear permeated the game... waiting for haunting to begin!When it finally did, I was the monster. And I was honestly a little scared because they made me stay by myself in the bathroom while they discussed their strategy as the humans trying to escape the house. The game will be hard for people who like clear rules and instructions since it sometimes doesn't provide it or it's buried in some obscure section of the manual. I'm someone who is flexible, who thinks it's fine as long as we stay consistent with whatever rules we decide on. Whereas another player was really annoyed because having a poorly chosen rule (even if it is inconsistent) can make the game unfair.I would like the game better if they made a non-scary version. Like this is a garden game and you are plants -- and you have to get your fertilizer, nutrients, water before the humans come to harvest you.The game play said 1 hour. It took us 3+ hours to play. Admittedly way spent 30+ minutes on it just trying to understand the rules. One player literally fell a sleep while the rules were being read out loud and started snoring.

  While it may take a second to pick up on this game, Betrayal is a must-have board game for your collection. This game never gets boring--in fact, it's full of suspense! My friends and I have enjoyed the twists and turns and are always excited to see what the next game will bring. We recently purchased the expansion to play it all over again!It can be confusing for first-time players, and I highly recommend playing with at least one person who has played before. Play time can exceed 60 minutes, especially if you're not entirely sure what you're doing and have to keep consulting the rules.The game is divided into two ""chapters"": (1) exploring/building the board which is a collaborative stage where everyone works together and (2) the ""haunt"" in which the ""good guys"" fight a common enemy (sometimes this is a player or even the game itself). This keeps the game exciting! The board is never the same twice, and you'd be hard-pressed to go through all the scenarios for the ""haunt"".

  This game quickly became one of my favorite board games after I purchased it. Each playthrough is so vastly different its a very refreshing game to add to your collection. I love the mechanics of finding out who is the traitor halfway through the game and building the map as you go. My only real critique is build quality and some haunts can end very quickly depending on character builds.Build Quality: The insert for organizing the game for storage is terrible. You will want to replace it or remove it. If you want to combine the expansion and the base into 1 box you will HAVE to replace the insert. The clips use to track the stats per character are horrible. They are way too loose and can slip when you aren't paying attention. They sell an upgrade pack to fix this but you could just use pen and paper or paperclips instead. Everything else in the box is pretty high quality. The character models aren't that great but do the job.Haunts: They're random so you can't really plan ahead but sometimes you get just the right character stats to break a haunt and it can end in a few turns. The other haunts we got were pretty fun and balanced for both the traitor and the heroes.Overall I love this game but if using a fantasy theme doesn't bother you, I highly recommend buying the Betrayal at Baldur's Gate version instead. It has slightly upgraded mechanics and the characters feel more unique. The clips feel a bit better too.

  This is one of my favorite board games!Basically, you build a mansion as you go, exploring new rooms and encountering events, items, and omens along the way. No two games are ever the same except I always seem to get the mystic elevator!At a certain point you start the haunt, which is where you will discover that one player has turned traitor, there is a hidden traitor, or there is no traitor at all, but you still need to do certain  things to win. There are 50 haunts in the base game, and 50 more in the expansion.  I have played the base game quite a few times and still haven't played all of the haunts.The rules are mostly straight forward. I recommend watching a game play video before or after you read the rules to get a better idea of how to play. Some of the haunts have things that come up that aren't clearly outlined in the rules but you and your group will most likely become able to make good judgement calls when you are used to the game.As I mentioned, there is now an official expansion for the game that adds new haunts, an additional floor, new tokens, and new cards.

One of those ""classics"" that you should own.

  This game is basically comprised of two parts. In the first, you and the other players are explorers randomly revealing room tiles as you maneuver throughout the house.Many rooms will have an Event, Item or Omen associated with it and after you reveal the tile, you take a corresponding card and read it aloud. This furthers the story along and does a great job of giving the gameplay a lot of character and depth. I always love games where thematic, bite sized stories are incorporated into it (I.e. The Crossroads cards in Dead of Winter or the story book in Above and Below).Discovering and drawing Omen cards will move a counter in a track that you'll roll against. Eventually, youll fail the roll and the second part of the game (the haunt) begins.One of the players will become the Traitor at this point. He/she will take a special Traitor book and go into another room to read what they will be trying to do from that point forward. The other players will read from a Heroes book and concoct a strategy based on the details they are given.From that point forward the Traitor works against the Heroes. It's very fun, very engaging and playing with scary sound effect/music in the background is a hit.This is basically one of those ""must have"" games if you're a board ""gamer"".It is not without its faults however. First, the components/artwork are probably the worst I've ever seen. You'll need to heat the minis in boiling water and bend them back in place as well as heat the small tracker pieces that go on your characters board and pinch them together as they WILL fall off. I laughed when we played the first time as the ""Ballroom"" tile is about as ballroom looking as an empty shed. The art is horrendous and everything feels cheap. This is a game that can benefit from a WELL MADE rerelease.Second, the instructions do a fairly good job but they don't cover all situations (no instruction booklet in any game ever does) so you WILL need to clarify some things during game via Googling or through agreements by the players.Is it a ""family"" game? It does deal with occult topics and has monsters and is intended to be ""scary"". Cards can reference pentagrams, etc. so if you're offended by that sort of thing (lighten up!) then this isn't one for you and your family.

  I was introduced to the original game about 15 years ago, and I immediately fell in love with it!  It's equal parts RPG and Board game with mystery, horror, and survival built in!  It was discontinued for a hot second, and original versions of the game could be found online or used, but the price usually exceeded $80 or more.  A few years back, the re-release came out - still a little hefty in price.  So, I waited.  FINALLY it went down to half off on my favourite shopping site and I nabbed it up.  I have such great memories of playing this game, and I love teaching it to new people.  There are a ton of little bits and pieces, and there is a slight learning curve, but once you get rolling, it guarantees hours of fun.

  Our game night group all pitched in to get this game, and it was absolutely worth it. Most fun I've had with a board game in a while. Thematically, the game is very fun, and the artwork and design elements are nice and spooky, while keeping a fun playful atmosphere. Great for a Halloween game night, obviously.This game has a lot of replayability. Since you build the house as you go, the layout of the board is going to be different each game. And the 50 different ""Haunt scenarios"" means you will have 50 outcomes, with specific rules and objectives, so you will never play the same exact game twice.If anything, I'd say due to the many variables in the game, there are a lot of cards and pieces to keep track of. Might take you a couple plays through to figure out how to use all the elements. Would also recommend it more for folks who are a little more seasoned in board games. The rules can be daunting for novice players.As far as shipping, the game arrived in one piece, pristine condition, with all its parts and pieces intact.

... At House On The Hill is one of my favorite games. It combines an immersive theme
","

  Betrayal At House On The Hill is one of my favorite games. It combines an immersive theme, exploration, hidden traitors, and a twist every game. There are six characters that you can choose from and anywhere from three to six people can play, though I'd say five to six players is where the game really shines. At the beginning of the game, all the players start out in the foyer of the unexplored house on the hill, procedurally generating the rest of the house as they go. As they move around, they explore new rooms, which can trigger events, provide items, or revealing grim omens. Every omen revealed causes the player to have to roll against an ever increasing count. Failing this roll triggers ""The Haunt."" Using the rule book, the players determine which of the 50 scenarios you'll play out for the rest of the game. Each scenario features different rules, usually pitting one player against the others. Often times the betrayer will get supernatural powers and the rest of the players will receive instructions on how they can defeat this ancient evil, supernatural force, or what have you. Once either the betrayer's or the rest of the players' victory conditions is met, the game ends and an epilogue wraps things up quite nicely.This game really captures the B-movie horror/thriller/sci-fi vibe amazingly well! I love thematic games that immerse you in the game and allow you to create your own stories and Betrayal At House On The Hill definitely gives you those tools. The art and all of the components are great and add to the feel of the game. While the combat rules can be a little clunky at times and a few of the clips used to keep track of the various stats were a little loose and wouldn't stick, there is so much about this game to love, that I have to recommend it wholeheartedly! If you like co-op games, exploration, hidden traitor mechanics, or have ever wanted to play out an episode of Scooby Doo or a B-movie, do yourself a favor and check out Betrayal At House On The Hill!

Chasing Your Friends Through a Haunted House!
","

  I have owned this game for a year and it continues to be my favorite. Who wouldn't want to become a monster and chase your friends through a haunted mansion?!This game is divided into two phases. In the first half of the game, you explore the mansion together, dividing up to explore the three floors of the mansion as you see fit. The house is treacherous and many nasty events will occur, but occasionally you will gain a helpful item or stumble upon a boon for your character. In the second half of the game, once the requirements are met, the Haunt begins. One person will become the traitor (as revealed according to the manuals for that specific Haunt), and the rest are now working to defeat him or her. There are 50 haunts that occur, so no 2 games will ever be the same. With the layout of the house constantly changing and the randomness of items and (mostly terrible) events that occur, even having the same haunt again makes the game completely different each play.A fair note - this game involves LOTS of reading. It is a favorite in my regular game group, where we don't mind a heavier game with lots of stat tracking and reading, but when we try to get casual gamers involved, they sometimes get bored. Yes, you will be stopping to read a short few sentences aloud from a card at every turn. The Haunt in itself involves the traitor and the heros team dividing up to study a page of instructions. As much as I love this game, I don't think that it's a ""fun for all"" game. Also, the scary themes can be a bit mature for the younger audience.Other than that, I will continue to play this regularly, and look forward to the expansion this fall!

  So I heard lots of great things about this game and I must say....It's freaking awesome! There are QUITE a bit of rules (about 19 pgs.), but there are lots of video on YouTube of gamers playing it as well as some tutorial videos to help you and your friends learn. You need at least 3 players. After playing our first game me and my friends are hooked! We can't wait for game night again! Definitely reasonable and since I got it at a discount it made the price a bit easier to swallow. There are 50 different scenarios that could happen so no game, for the most part, will ever be the same. I'd say this is definitely for more advanced table top game board players.

Fantastic and fun game... But has some flaws

  First off, let me say my friends and I love this game. Very high level of replayability, easy to learn, high level of intrigue, and loads of fun!That being said, the game does have some flaws... There are 50 possible scenarios but many are not fully thought out by the designers. Some are heavily weighted to the Betrayer and some are heavily weighted to the heroes. Some of the scenarios also don't play as well as others because there's insufficient information provided for you to form a good strategy for your side. Sure, you can come up with ""house rules"" to fill in some of these blanks, but as the Betrayer, you're a team of one so it's difficult when you have questions about some of the scenario rules and you don't really have anyone to discuss with without revealing your powers/abilities/goals.

  To the plus, the game is always different the next time you play which makes it somewhat interesting.  The beginning of the game is similar each time, but once you start the ""Haunt"" there are dozens of different versions with different rules.  The downside to this is that you are always reading rules, which are not always clear, and it slows the game down.  So, it is very much like the slowness of playing a game for the first time every time you play.  My daughter loves this game, but I find it rather boring.  I'm averaging and giving it 3 stars.

A hit with the whole family and has a new adventure every time
","

  This game is really fun and has loads of replay-ability. For one the house will never end up having the same layout since you draw tiles as you go. You also have six different characters to choose from each with their own stats. Also there are 50 different haunt scenarios which changes the game drastically and makes one person become a traitor.Basically it is a game for up to 6 people where you are explorers going into a haunted mansion. You get six different characters to choose from each with different stats that will drastically make a difference in the game depending on who you are and what the haunt ends up being. The initial set up takes a while since you need to punch out a bunch of cardboard pieces but at least they are high quality and made on thick cardboard. The character pieces come painted and look decent enough. The house tiles are held together by little clips which if you don't touch the tiles to much when your playing with them you shouldn't need to worry about them always coming apart. The rules are pretty easy to learn and after playing a game you should be able to explain everything to a new player easily. The first time playing will take a while to get everything right but after that its super easy and you will hardly ever need to look up something in the rule book.Back to the game. So each person moves around the house going room to room adding tiles. With each new room added to the house something good or bad can happen. You could find an item, have an event happen, or get an omen card. An example being you could find an awesome item in a room or you could end up having a spider land on your shoulder and you need to roll to see what happens. So as the game goes on occasionally when you enter a new room you will get an omen card and if you don't roll good enough the haunt starts. One person becomes the traitor and has a goal that varies with each scenario such as taking out all the explorers. The explores have their own goal which also varies with each haunt. The first to finish their goal wins and also the explorers don't know what the traitors goal is and the traitor doesn't know the explorers goal. There's even some scenarios where no one knows who the traitor is.Overall this game was very fun and fairly easy to learn. A game can end very quickly or it could take an hour. I liked the quality of the pieces and how they were on thick cardboard. Before buying this I saw that some of the older reviews said the components were bad but they must have changed them because mine were on nice thick cardboard. I also liked the amount of replay-ability since no two games will be the same. This was a hit for my whole family and it makes for a fun evening every time.

Tons of Spooky Fun!
","

  This is an excellent game. Perfect for groups up to 6. The game has a changing narrative that evolves throughout the game's run time. As an avid horror movie fan, it is extremely fulfilling to see some of my favorite horror movie tropes rear their fearsome heads in a board game. I have played this game a handful of times, and no two games have played out the same way. The board changes shape, the villain appears as a result of moves you make during the game, and the variable strengths of the different characters give it an RPG feeling.The game plays in two phases. I call the first phase the ""Buffing Phase."" During this oart of the game, it is in your best interest to find any way possible to increase your character stats in preparation for the arrival of the villain. The second phase comes after ""The Reveal."" One of your party has betrayed your group, and has led you to your potential death. Your objective becomes defeating that player, as well as the evil he/she has released.The game makes you question every decision you make, with respect to cooperating with other players. You don't want to be too close to them on the board, because you can become their first target, but at the same time, there is strength in numbers following the reveal. Who knows? You may end up being the person who has betrayed your friends.I highly recommend this game for fans of horror movies and games, or lovers of group/board games.

  Great little board game. My friend's and I love it. But there are some issues with the game.The overall build quality is super cheap. A vast majority of tokens for the game is just punch out cardboard, I really wish they would have been at least plastic.The mini figures are made out of a super soft plastic and as a result, a bunch of them were deformed out of a brand new, sealed box.The inside of the box isn't designed in a way to actually deal with all it's parts. There's tons of loose tokens and parts and there just isn't enough space to store and organize the parts in any useful way.If all the pieces were made out of more durable material, if the miniatures didn't come out of the box deformed and if they would have put more thought into the storage of loose parts, it'd have been a 5 star product.

Impeccable Game with Lots of Replayability

  My friends and I have played this game a lot over the past couple of years and have absolutely loved it. The atmosphere built by all aspects of the game is fantastic, and the variety of characters, rooms, and cards makes for a unique experience every time you play. We have absolutely loved the dynamic of the game, where parties start off neutral and later are turned against one another, and we have played through each of the game's 50 unique haunts. One of my complaints about the base game is how hard it is to escape the basement (the expansion pack negates this issue), as well as a lack of spare parts (we have lost several pieces over time, but we have made it work. The game's mechanics offer a great challenge of strategy where almost every action has its consequences. I like to think of it as a simpler form of Dungeons and Dragons where the campaign always involves a haunted house. I would give this game six stars if I could, and I would suggest it to anyone who loves strategy board games, creepy stuff, and Betrayal.

Decent game, poor components
","

  I bought this game for our family after watching it played on Tabletop.  The game play is almost entirely a game of chance.  You basically roll dice, move around revealing tiles/rooms, roll dice again, etc, hoping to get some decent items until a haunt roll is failed.  The game gets more interesting once the haunt begins, the betrayer is discovered (even to him/herself) and a short story ensues.  The haunts we've played so far have been very different from one another, so there is definitely variety here.  Unfortunately, the haunts don't seem to last very long.  It's all over rather quickly, for one side or the other.  Even so, it can be a fun light game.  My 9 year old really gets into it.My biggest gripe is component quality, specifically the character wheels.  The ones on the show were big and sturdy, the sliders attached well and stayed in place.  They looked really cool and unique and their ease of use was part of the reason I was interested in this game.  The ones in our box are large but also very thin and flimsy.  The cheap plastic clips to use as sliders DO NOT STAY ON, much less stay in place.  The slightest shift anywhere near them makes them slide around and if you pick up the wheel to look closer, most of them fall right off.  Since many events in the game require moving the sliders, and each move may or may not actually change the value of the stat, it can be a real pain to keep track.  Aesthetics aside, components need to at least function properly, especially at this price point.

  This is a great board game for only the most avid group of players. If you have friends that are not willing to putforth what can potentially be a long game (one of our games took 4 hours to finish) than you will be disappointed. It does take a while to get the mechanics of the game but once you have played through it a few rounds it flows very smooth. There is a shift/twist in every game that changes the mechanics of play slightly but keeps the game fresh and repayable. If you're an avid fan and have a good group of friends who are the same, this is a great pickup for your collection. Quality of the parts seem to be good and the card stock isn't bad. You will need a big table for this game as you are exploring a multiple floored mansion.

  Fun game but the pieces have such a horrible paint job. Probably pretentious to whine about that but seriously so ugly. Each figure only had 3 colors. I'm repainting them because I hated it so much and even if you don't have painting skills, it's mandatory to at least paint the base color to correlate to the piece color since pieces like purple only had a tiny purple tank top, and red has just as much blue  as the blue piece.Pic included shows 1 I finished (green), 2 WIP (yellow is almost done and purple just started), and the last 3 I've only added a bit of flesh tone and base primer.

The game isnt too difficult to learn and we only needed a short time to go over the basic rules and begin playing.  Our first game took about 1.5-2 hours which wasn't bad for a brand new game none of us had played before.The pieces were all of pretty decent quality, the only small issue I found was the character pieces are made of a soft plastic material and one of them was bent at an angle slightly, but it was easy to correct by bending the piece the other way to straighten it out.One thing to note is you may want to get some of the small Ziploc bags (snack size would work well) to separate the smaller token categories as there are a LOT of small tokens of different types and keeping them organized looks like it could be a pain.  We spent a lot of time both at the beginning of the game and at the start of the haunt phase sorting through the tokens to find the ones we needed for the scenario.Overall I would say this game is more than worth it!

Beautiful game components, light and easy rules with smooth gameplay
","

  There is no doubt about how great this game looks, you will be drawn in by the quality of the components and how visually pleasing it is out on your table.  We love that as well.In Tapestry you'll follow very simple rules to advance and build your own civilization from just discovering and making fire to eventually launching spaceships or creating AI singularities.  It sounds like quite a journey, and it is, you'll get the chance to advance however you want along 4 different tracks.  This is a very fun option and one that seems very well enjoyed by everyone we've played this with.  All the time while advancing on these tracks you'll use your civilization's special abilities to help grow and expand your territory and build up your city.There are a lot of fun parts of this game that play off of one another, and can generate unique ways for you to score victory points.  With so many ways to score points in different areas of the game board even new players will find themselves competing in score with experienced players.  So there is a nice balance between everything, unless you choose to spread yourself too thin on all the tracks you'll find it very competitive.We have a lot of fun playing this, my wife perhaps more so than me.  I do have a few problems with it that drop my personal thoughts on it a little.  It‚Äôs a simple game, this is not the issue though, I love a simple game, they are fun and exciting.  My problem is, this is a huge box game with so many things in it, so many abilities, possibilities, options, ways to score, ways to play.  There is just so much possible in this game, that for it to play so simply then kills it for me just a little bit.  I wanted more from it, being such a great put together game with great quality components and it being so vast in possibilities I just want a bit more complexity from it.My larger complaint with the game is the Rulebook; I am not satisfied with that at all.  It is not as descriptive or full as it needs to be.  There are many icons not explained, you can reference through an included sheet and match up things and eventually learn what something that isn't represented means.  The Warp Space tiles for example are not explained at all.  It could also have benefitted from a few play examples, or at least a simple setup guide.  Our very first game of this was a struggle of referencing rules online and referring to the Rulebook for answers we hoped we'd find but didn't.  You can learn the whole game this way, but the turnaround time on your first game or two could be decreased a lot with a better Rulebook.I still recommend this game and like to show it to new players.  It is not at all that I don't enjoy it; this one just falls slightly lower on my list as far as how much I like it.  I've enjoyed many of the other games from Stonemaier much more than this one, but my wife rates this one at the top of her lists, so again you can see it comes down to just personal preferences.It is for sure one to own and enjoy playing, I think it plays best with at least 3 players.  2 is a doable and works well but the added players do increase the tension and enjoyment for me.  There is an alternate Automa set of rules for playing a 3rd in a 2 player game.  I'll be sure to update once we've given that a try.

Gorgeous game but Little Expensive and Boring
","

  COMPONENT QUALITY:The game board, component pieces, art-work on all the cards is gorgeous as is expected from any Stonemaier game these days. Tons of painted miniatures and great production quality means that the game is fairly expensive. The rulebook is just 4 pages which feels insufficient to learn the game in detail.GAMEPLAY:The game looks complicated but is comparatively easy to teach as is evident from the short rulebook. It's described as Civilization game, but doesn't feel like one. It feels more like an abastract engine building game. It doesn't have right mechanics or theme to give you feel of managing economy, army, science, building/people etc. It does little bit of everything but not to the true depth. It makes for a pretty gateway game though.The asymmetric nature of civilization cards and randomly drawn tapestry cards means that some games could become really one-sided.CONCLUSION:Go for it if you like abstract engine building games or are a big Stonemaier fan.For me personally, overall gameplay itself is not that fulfilling to justify this expensive purchase.

  This is a great engine building civilization board game in which you guide a civilization through time advancing your technology, expanding your territory, and expanding your ability to generate resources. It is relatively easy to learn for this genre of game and can be played in 2-3 hours.

Overall, it is a very fun game that can be learned quickly but has an immense amount of depth.

  I enjoy this game. It has its flaws. Some civilizations are now powerful than others, but this has since been balanced out with a sheet you can download and print from the SM website. Game looks beautiful once it‚Äôs all set up. Gameplay can be clunky the first few times. The game is very picture based, but thankfully there is a cheat sheet for every action in the game. This can hinder your ability to plan, if you‚Äôre not able to understand what the next action in line is.Automa is fun to play against. I‚Äôm not a great player, so I always get beat. Definitely a challenge. This game makes it to the table more than Wingspan, which came out the same year by the same company.

Rules Are Really Complicated
","

  This game looks great, the art style is fantastic and at first glance, the concept is awesome. However, it feels like this game never went through any play testing, at all. Some of the civilizations in the game are way too overpowered, while others are woefully underpowered. After playing the game at least three times, I still hadn't figured out all the rules, realizing at the scoring phase that I was still doing something wrong. Still, the game is fun once you learn the rules, and don't use some of the civilizations, and spend four hours figuring out how the stupid tapestry mechanic works, and yeah....

  I've played Tapestry dozens of times and still look forward to the next game! It's one of those games where it's easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master the moves so that they stack on each other. Component quality is top notch, and although there's lots of pieces and cards to set up, it comes with lots of bags to organize. Many will criticize the randomness of the card draws, civilization powers, or rolls of dice, but every game has that to some degree. The beauty of the game is learning how to use that randomness to your advantage. Highly recommend this game for anyone who has dipped their toes into European style board games and wants to take it to the next level!

  As someone who grew up with Advanced Civilization, the ur-game of this genre, I find that Tapestry lacks as much interaction as I would like.

  1-5 players, Competitive, Civ Creation Resource ManagementOverview of GameplayIn Tapestry players will be manipulating resource totals around in order to gain other items all in an effort to achieve those delish victory points. The game is actually very simple and ramps up the strategy the longer you play. A typical revolution around the board consists of each player either taking a ‚ÄúAdvance‚Äù turn or an ‚ÄúIncome‚Äù turn. An Advance turn is the primary turn player will be taking which consists of simply spending one (or more) of four resources to pay for the cost of advancing one of your player tokens up one of the four advancement tracks on the board. Doing this in turn allows the player to collect something such as a new invention card or exploration tiles which you can then manipulate depending on the actions.So around and around the table players will be doing this, each player trying to maximize the amount and quality of advancements they take before they have to move into a new era. BUT when a player does eventually run out of resources to spend they will have to take the second of two main actions, the Income turn. Now the income turn is very important as it not only refills some of your resources but gains you precious other things including victory points. The first thing you will be doing will be activating any action that your particular civilization has. Now some civs have ongoing abilities that activate during other points in any round but there are quite a few that ONLY activate at the beginning of the income turn. After that you will be playing one of your Tapestry cards to your player mat which will either unlock an ongoing benefit for you during the entire next era (which is the turns in between the Income turns) or some immediate benefit. After that you can upgrade one of your Tech cards if you have any played and collect vp‚Äôs based on whatever is uncovered on your player mat (from playing income buildings on your capital city mat) and finally gain some resources, the amount also based on uncovered areas on your player mat.Players will all be taking the income turn at different times depending on how efficient they were with their resource spending. Also you will only be playing a total of three Tapestry cards to your player mat over the course of the game so you do have some variety on which card to play when to try and gain the most benefit out of it. Once you take your fifth income turn, (one right at the onset of the game, one for each of the three placed tapestry cards and one more at the very end) your game is over. And since each players game may end at different times you can sit back and watch to see how others may stack up on points in comparison. Whoever ends the game with the most points, wins!Components/Game BoardOk let‚Äôs get into the meat and potatoes here. The components are excellent all around as to be expected from Stonemaier Games. The game has a premium feel coming off of it as soon as you open the box. The little income buildings have four different sculpts and colors to differentiate them. The cards all have a nice finish on them and they have a good thickness to them. The three custom dice all look great and have a nice hefty feel to them. But the big standout here is the landmark building minis. Each one is uniquely sculpted AND fully painted which really makes them standout and honestly they just look really cool. The board is also well designed with nice rounded edges and a kind of matte finish to it AND is also double-sided for different player counts.Now the player mats have this very nice rough texture to them that interestingly enough interacts with the resource tokens in a specific way. So playing the game you will be moving these four plastic tokens left and right on this track to determine how much of each you have to spend. Well depending on which side you flip each token you could have a nice smooth slide or a more ‚Äúgrabby‚Äù side that kinda sticks to the rough surface. Not sure if these were designed like that but I think it‚Äôs a nice touch. HOWEVER I do believe those resource tokens are a tad too big. I have fiddled quite a bit with these things and many times all four tokens end up crossing paths or all rest on the same section. The areas the tokens are meant to reside are just not big enough for the size of said tokens. The resource tokens themselves are shaped like the corresponding resource they are meant to represent. BUT they are peculiar shapes that everyone (including myself) has just given nicknames because we are not sure what they are. There‚Äôs a star and a mushroom and bag of gold and an‚Ä¶‚Ä¶overweight middle-aged man.On top of that the color combos are kinda tricky to get down. Now each resources color corresponds to a particular colored income building BUT the color for the corresponding advancement track (where you will find most of its upgrades) is a completely different color. So as you are eyeballing your player mat plotting out an epic strategy based on certain income buildings you then have to search for the correct advancement track on the game board. One other minor thing the colors of the Farms (brown) and the houses (Gray) are kind of hard to distinguish on the game board, this of course could just be a ‚Äúme‚Äù thing but I have done many double takes between those two specifically.There is also something to be said for table space. The board itself isn‚Äôt THAT big but you need space to one side for the tech and tapestry cards, the exploration tile piles, the landmark building board and the few other landmarks that don‚Äôt go on that particular board. Even after all that your player area commands a large swath of space as well. I‚Äôm super torn on how I feel about this as I do think once put together your player area looks fantastic HOWEVER the amount of space each player needs is very large indeed. Each player will pick a particular civilization to play as which is placed down in front of them, then players will take a generic player mat which is place to the immediate right of their civ mat. Now players will choose a particular capital city mat based on their starting location which is placed to the immediate right of the player mat. AND THEN you need to make sure you have space to the right of the capital mat for any tech cards you invent during the game.Now all this looks incredible when attached and laid out in front of you, a fine display indeed. But boy is it a table hog. Depending on the table you may have to end up just placing the three mats however you can to have them fit, WHICH of course works just fine and the only thing you will be missing is the conformity of the mats. But ugh, breaking them up is like breaking up the Power Ranger Megazord into the smaller and (less cool) pieces.One last thing, and this will basically fly into the face of everything I said about table space but I wish there as a small board to hold the other random six building miniature landmarks that are not a part of the advancement tracks. There is a board to hold the regular landmarks but the other six (which you can gain through invention cards) are just kinda set aside. Perhaps a bigger landmark board with a labeled section just for those? Or a separate smaller board even. Overall, really impressed with the components and game board with only a few minor ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù things that don‚Äôt really affect gameplay being the downside.Box/StorageThe insert is pretty good. It houses all the landmark minis and even though they are not labeled and of different sizes, they are super easy to put up after you have played a couple times. Not only that, but there is a picture of the corresponding spots they go in on the side of the inner box. There are also two rather deep sections that you can store the tiles, dice and cards in with a clear topper to make sure everything stays in place. You will of course have to bag up all the rest of the components such as the income buildings and player tokens but the game comes with a bunch of baggies to do just that.Visual Appeal /ThemeThe overall theme of the game is civilization building. You pick from a very large batch of completely different civs right at the beginning and start improving your civilization through various enhancements. Now if you look TOO deep into the words and flavor of these advancements, it might bewilder you a bit. But just remember this game isn‚Äôt based on our REAL world‚Äôs progress, this game basically takes real world things and lays them out for each player and says, ‚Äútake your pick, how do YOU want to advance‚Äù.An example of this is that a player could advance to nuclear weapons on one track but could still be stuck on pottery on another. Now for me this didn‚Äôt pull me out of the ‚Äúrealism‚Äù of the game at all as I just took those words more as flavor than anything. I mean considering you are primarily advancing to get those luscious benefits, not the flavor, it makes sense.The artwork both on the board and the cards is excellent and the different civ mats look excellent as well. Overall super impressed with not only the artwork, but style. The only thing that could be tweaked would be that some of the colors are a bit too muted. Primarily the grays and browns for those respective income buildings.RulebookOmg. The return of the soft, supple rulebook! Before I opened my copy I had read that the book was only 4 pages and for a moment was like whaaaa? But then read that it also was made of the same material that the Wingspan rulebook is. Pre-Ordered. The softness of these pages cannot be overstated. I need a blanket of this, a full four page Tapestry rulebook blanket.But yeah four pages! That‚Äôs nuts if you think about it, and these are not four pages crammed with tiny printed information either. There are some picture examples and, overall, very well explained rules. Now that said there were a couple things I had to infer as they weren‚Äôt literally spelled out for me and a thing or two that I assumed based around other rules but overall very impressed with this rulebook. It does a very good job of getting you into the game and playing very quickly.Now the Automa rulebook was much more challenging to comprehend. That rulebook was also super short but after one read through that I had MANY more questions. The actions are more confusing and I think a better explanation of each automa action with picture example would improve it. One particular automa action had me really scratching my head for a while until I deciphered it and I think it mostly boiled down to the way it was worded. Of course after finally figuring out how it‚Äôs played, looking back the actions are really simple, it‚Äôs just understanding it in the first place.Player Interaction/Fun FactorThe player interaction is pretty low. On a normal turn you will be manipulating your own player mat to meet your own ends. That said, there are many things that players can do that will impact other players in some way. Players will be climbing these advancement tracks and as they do the first player to reach each new tier will gain one of those special and unique landmark minis to add to their personal capital city mat. There are only ONE of each of these so the first to nab it is it.Speaking a little more on those and the capital city mat, when players gain income buildings and landmarks they add them to this mat to try and fill in spaces in an effort to complete 3x3 sections and full rows and columns. For each 3x3 section filled up you can gain any one resource and for each row and/or column filled nets you victory points. So the primary thing to being the first to snatch these landmarks is that you can fill up quite a few spaces all at once on your capital mat whereas the little income buildings only take up one tiny little square each. To be honest though I do wish the landmark buildings did give some other differing bonus OTHER than just filling up spaces. I mean there are some cards that give you more points based on how many landmarks you have but that‚Äôs only IF you draw and place those.SO back to player interaction, another form of interaction comes from the conquering of territories. As you explore and lay down new tiles (which also give vp‚Äôs and usually some other reward) you are opening up a whole new world of land to potentially take over. As you progress up the military advancement track you can plop down these little control point tokens of your player color on adjacent explored tiles. If you happen to toss one down on a tile that already has just one of another players color then you basically overthrow them from the land and take it over. Toppling their control tower but leaving it there as a grim reminder to never dare resist them again. In game terms once a tile has two control tokens on it, you CANNOT overthrow it, so even a toppled token still counts as one. BUT if you do this and the other player (who you are attempting to overthrow) slaps down a ‚ÄúTrap‚Äù card then it is YOU who is overthrown! These devious trap cards are disguised as regular Tapestry cards so players never really know what you have in hand.Mostly though the player interaction is pretty limited. The downtime honestly isn‚Äôt that bad though since you are constantly scanning the board and your player mat to plot out your next turn as others are taking theirs. As the game progresses the turns do get a bit longer since the cost of advancements is continually on the rise as you move up the tracks and placements on your capital mat get even more strategic as you start filling up sections. However players with AP will find this game chock FULL of difficult choices. So many options to take with so many ways to take them depending on which resource to spend and the way choices will cascade and create new openings. Personally I love this aspect of the game, the way you can do one simple action and it turns into a massive multi-action turn.Also depending on the civ you pick you can really get a cool engine going focusing on a certain method of play. For example I have played as the Craftsman (one of my favs) and they focus on building up a massive statue instead of building up their capital city. This means when you gain those little income buildings you can place them on your civ card instead and gain specific rewards there. BUT by doing this you are basically forfeiting all those row/column bonuses you would normally get for building up a large capital city. This in turn means you probably don‚Äôt need to focus so much on placing the ‚Äúhouse‚Äù income buildings since those focus more on improving the vp gain of those bonuses. WHICH in turn means you can really focus on bringing out some of the other income buildings more fully. I love this. I love how each different civ brings out specific strategies for play and there are even civs that are balanced around doing whatever you want by basically just giving you extra resources or advancing your advancement paths a little quicker.Optimal Player Count/ReplayabilitySo the board is double-sided, one side for the 1-3 player count and the other side with a bigger starting area for the 4-5 player count. All AP prone players aside, the way this game plays out I would suggest starting at lower player counts to learn it and then ramping up as everyone becoming familiar. I mean the same could be said for any game I suppose but this one in particular is so much more enjoyable when everyone has a good grasp on what is going on. I have seen learning games of five players take around four hours and fully learned games of three/four players take around an hour and a half. Even after a SINGLE game though it becomes very apparent what you need to focus on first for your next game which cuts down play time significantly. For example, my wife went wild trying to get out ‚Äúhouses‚Äù to her capital city board on her first learning game only to find out that those are really only beneficial if you have a large amount of rows/columns filled up. So probably not a good section to start clearing income buildings starting out.Also there are instructions to add a ‚Äúshadow‚Äù AI player into the mix if you play a two player and solo game which creates a bit more urgency to those games. Basically that critter will be trying to gobble up those precious landmark buildings before other players. You don‚Äôt HAVE to add that in, but it‚Äôs there which I really enjoy. Speaking on the solo mode a bit more, once you figure out how to play it‚Äôs a really fun game! Since the actions are pretty simple it‚Äôs as easy as moving a particular AI token up on an advancement track and the actions the AI takes are clearly labeled on these nice reference cards so you can whip through turns pretty quickly. Plus the points during each AI income turn ramps up DRASTICALLY each era it goes through. So, speaking from personal experience here, don‚Äôt let your guard down. I was so sure I had a win under my belt because of my commanding lead only to be defeated on the last era because of its massive point gain.I think the replay value game here is very large. Beyond the decently sized decks of different Tapestry cards and invention cards there are SO MANY different civilizations to choose from that each game is a completely different experience. I went through each one and read up on them to try and sort them out into piles of similarities. I only found two that really focused on just gaining you flat out resources every income phase and two that really focused on advancing your tracks. The rest were unique enough from each other that you could easily form entire game changing strategies from them. For example the Inventors focus on gaining benefits from yours or others invention cards and you could form an entire strategy of bringing out that certain income buildings to your capital that enhances the vp gain you get from how many tech cards you have. And this is just one example of a plethora of options.Positive Final ThoughtsThis is a very fun and exciting game where you can form all kinds of different strategies based around your specific civilization. Not only that, but it seems like whichever strategy you employ has its own merits. Just going in on one of the more ‚Äúbasic‚Äù civs you can delve down certain advancement tracks and see how the game differs between you and opponents. It‚Äôs truly a marvel to behold. With the large amount of options for player count this game is very wide open for both play style and quantity or players.Negative Final ThoughtsTable space can be an issue for those with limited sized tables but at the same time I would like a mat for the extra six landmarks. I wish the income building‚Äôs and the resources had more clearly labeled differentiators to tell them apart as when I teach the game I end up calling them by their color BUT, at least for me, the colors are muted enough (the gray and browns particularly) that I still have to point them out. I also wish the landmark buildings had more going on with them other than just their size and ability to take up more spaces on the capital city mat.

My wife loved it, so that‚Äôs a winner for me!

  I got into more advanced board games only within the last six months and Scythe was kind of my gateway game. I wanted to try another game to mix it up. Of course after research I came across several other good games (Gloomhaven etc.) but I decided to go with Tapestry since it‚Äôs a Stonemeier game and I really appreciate the extreme effort they put into the quality of their materials. Even rulebooks just FEEL high quality and I really appreciate that. Should also mention I really wanted to try Wingspan as I am told it is more popular, but at the moment that one is supposed to be sold out through Spring 2020.Anyway, this game is not like Scythe at all in terms of gameplay and thats not a bad thing. The rule book was just a few pages and super easy to pick up and understand. I also really appreciate how the rules reference can quickly explain what certain icons mean. My wife was on the fence about taking on another one of my new games but she understood it really quickly and now can‚Äôt wait to play again! Those of you with spouses who aren‚Äôt naturally big gamers know how exciting it is when they want to play the games you enjoy.Is it a game you will play over and over and over again? Maybe not. And I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worth it‚Äôs current $109 cost (I‚Äôd say 69-79 is more appropriate). But I really enjoyed it a lot and it‚Äôs one I plan to play again!

A Hit from Stonemaier, but not their best Solo version
","

  If you like Stonemaier in general, or excellent, creative strategy games, this is for you. I often get caught up in my own storybuilding and forget to compete as hard as I should, it's that enjoyable. This is my favorite to come out of this studio so far.  That said, I love when games give me solo options. And this is the most convoluted, difficult to learn solo version I have come across. Which makes sense, SM usually brings in another designer to revamp for 1-player. So if you're looking for great 1-player versatility, this isn't it, but otherwise, it's a big win.

Light on theme, but gorgeous and engaging
","

  The theme is definitely not immersive, as you do not feel like you are building a civilization. That said, the gameplay is incredibly engaging. The choices are simple yet satisfying; you choose to advance on any of the four tracks. Since the choices are not complex, it is not a brain burner. In fact, it feels like it plays quickly, despite being a longer game. If you like Stonemaier games, you will likely enjoy this one too.

  Stonemayer macht nunmal sch√∂ne Spiele. So auch hier: Tapestry ist wirklich wundersch√∂n. Komplett anders, als Scythe und trotzdem: man will es alleine wegen der sch√∂nen Komponenten spielen.Die Regeln sind schnell drin, man kann es problemlos als Kennerspiel einstufen. Es spielt sich schnell und fl√ºssig, dabei aber nicht etwa mechanisch oder repetitiv. Es bietet auch f√ºr viele Partien genug Abwechslung, und bleibt bis zum Ende spannend. Soweit die (sorry, will nicht spoilen, deshalb recht oberfl√§chlichen) Positiva.Aber: da gibt es ein paar Momente, die nicht jedem gefallen werden. Einerseits hat es W√ºrfel, die, vor allem der zw√∂lfseitige, ziemlichen Einfluss auf das Spiel haben k√∂nnen, andererseits,Karten, die man zieht, die in ihrer Macht recht unausgeglichen sind. Ergo: es kann passieren, dass man eine sehr gute Strategie verfolgt, dann aber ein Widersacher mit einer ordentlichen Portion Gl√ºck dann an einem vorbeizieht. Das kann frusten und wirkt etwas ‚Äûunpoliert‚Äú...Sieht man aber dar√ºber hinweg und spielt Tapestry, das nun auch keine Ewigkeit dauert (ca. 75min mit vier Leuten, die es k√∂nnen), als ‚ÄûCasual+-Worker Placement/Territory Control‚Äú, dann kann man eine Menge Spa√ü haben.Zur besseren Einsch√§tzung, ein paar Titel, denen ich f√ºnf Sterne geben w√ºrde: Terraforming Mars, Terra Mystica, The Gallerist, Blood Rage, Brass, aber bspw. auch Port Royale oder Welcome to your perfect home.

  Tapestry is one of the best produced games of all times. Without a doubt. Though this is one of those board games which did not enjoy much love among cult board gamers due to some balancing issues here and there, my group and i loved it (with a few house rules adjusted). Some people did complain that this is not a civic building game but i find it exactly the opposite. You get a civilization with some unique features (acc to which you will have to adjuat your strategy) and you have 4 different paths to advance your civilization on (military, science, exploration and inventions) and there is also a central map board to explore tiles on and conquer areas to gain certain resource/benefits. Sounds pretty much a civilization building game to me. The only complaint i have from this game is the conflict which is very minimal and sometimes completely unnecessary, but then again, most Euro games do shy away from conflicts and battles. This is a beautiful engine building civilization game which will test your brains for sure. Now, coming to the production, as mentioned earlier, is beautiful. Special mention to the playeraids which are so informative yet crisp. It exactly does the job for which it was made.Overall, it is a fun Euro style civic engine building game with alot of choices. Moreover, there are so many ways to win this game that it never gets booring. Each time i play this i end up discovering a new strategy.

Absolute blast for the adults and kids, READ WHY!
","

  So as a last minute thought, my daughter was turning 6, and i was searching around for a game that we could play together as a family, that would be fun also for the adults.This is it, at first, i saw the reviews and the awards and thought this surely sounds like it has great potential, and then while we were waiting for it to arrive via prime, i started doing some more reading about the game and read some other review from someone else, that was not on amazon, and I started to think this was basically going to be just like scrabble, simply matching either the colors of pictures of the tiles, until someone ran out of tiles to win.  This to me did not seem fun and I was almost certain I was going to end up returning it.  But i couldn't help remember that the game had won awards and all the great reviews from others, so who knows, maybe its great, maybe not.So showed up, daughter, I and Grandma sat down, at just the first couple of rounds it all came together and I could instantly see all of the strategy options, the fun of getting and using half and sun stones, along with wind tiles.  Not the depth of playing something like risk or civilization necessarily, but plenty of options and such to make it fun, and that it doesn't have to be a long sitting to play, that is nice with our busy life style.But WAIT, the BEST part of this game, AT LEAST FOR US, was i wanted something we ALL could play and have fun, and even though it will take multiple game plays for the young one to learn all of the strategy tactics, she still had fun because it was easy to match the pictures and colors, and when you matched two or more sides, getting half or sun stones, her eyes glowed like fire!So even though we can play competitively, and she just plays for the matching and fun, FOR NOW, everyone enjoys, This might be one of the best thought out family games I have ever seen.Most kid games are cute, and they like them, but not all that fun for the adult, other than watching the children enjoy themselves, we can actually have fun at the same time!BRILLIANT.

Great Game for the WHOLE Family
","

  We just started playing Latice Hawai'i, and I see this game going into PERMANENT rotation on game nights and for Family gatherings. I had been eyeing it for a while, and we finally picked it up, and I'm so glad I did. It's thinky enough to be interesting, but you can also play on a lighter level while chatting.Why we like it-It's fairly easy to learn with straightforward rules.It plays in about 20- 35 minutes (depending on analysis paralysis). There's even an included timer, if you do have someone holding up the game!The pieces are solid, and can take a lot of handling without breaking down (the tiles and holders are plastic) and the game insert holds them perfectly, whether you shelve games horizontally or vertically. (I love the gems!)The artwork is good... clean and clear images and great colors.There are multiple layers of rules, so you can adjust for the younger players.The Rule book is clear, but you can also see videos put out by the company.It works for all the different generations of players in the family (my mom down to my kids) I can not emphasize how important this is in my world. Our family plays games when we get together, so we are always looking for something that works for multiple generations... and is still fun for everyone.The Latice Hawaii box is fairly compact, so we can take it along on vacations.It's tile laying, and that's our family sweet spot!Latice Hawaii is well deserving of all of the awards that it's won. I recommend it without reservation!

  Our family (kids ages 12-18) love games that are reasonably quick to learn, don't take too long to play, and require some smarts and strategy. This one fits the bill perfectly! The game and parts are all beautiful and very well made. I love the design of the box as well!  It looks like it will hold up better than some traditional boxes. We have only played a few times so far, but each time, everyone starts to pick up a few more strategic moves and figures out how to better play the game. My teens usually groan and roll their eyes at family game time (even though they usually have fun anyway), but so far, I haven't gotten any rolled eyes from this one! Score!

Great strategy game for kids and adults! So many ways to play also!
","

  We (adult couple, late twenties) enjoy strategy games and this one was extremely easy to learn. The company even has a wonderful 3 minute video on YouTube to explain how to play so you don‚Äôt have to read the directions!This game can have as much strategy as you desire. A younger child could easily pick it up because you match the colors/shapes basically; however, you have wind pieces that move other pieces to set up for you next move. You want to get rid of all your tiles first. So, kids may take longer to master the strategy part of it but could still play and enjoy with adults. That‚Äôs awesome!This game is made of TOP QUALITY materials. The board is very thick and nicely printed. The plastic tile tray is thick and very nice with the name of the board game on the back and it holds 5 tiles perfectly. The tiles are thick plastic with stickers already on them so it‚Äôs ready to play out of the box. The gemstones are plastic and feel great in your hand. It also comes with a timer for other ways to play the game‚Äîwhich is also neat! The rules include several other ways to play the game so you can swap it out and it becomes a whole new experience if you want something different or more challenging.If you like board games or are looking to get into playing board games, this is a great intro game to get you started because it‚Äôs so easy to learn. I recommend showing the short video before having new people play with you so they have the gist.Buy this game!!! It‚Äôs well worth the money in quality product, fun game time (20 minutes each game), and ability to mix it up and play different versions WITHOUT any type of expansion packs.

  We are a board game family, so finding a new, fun game isn't that easy.  I like games with easy to figure out directions and this one fits that bill.  I also like games that don't take a super long time to set up or play.  I often play with one child at a time, and after playing several games in a row, I don't want to feel like my day is shot.  This is perfect for that.  It's fun, easy for everyone to understand, and it's got just the right combination of strategy and luck involved.

  Ordered this in early March off a sponsored ad on Facebook and saved it for my son‚Äôs birthday gift at the end of the month. Currently staying home due to Covid 19 regulations and have to say, of all the myriad games and crafts we have in the house, THIS is the one game everyone wants to play every day, multiple times a day. In full disclosure, our family has an affinity for anything Polynesian or Polynesian-inspired, and the artwork and Hawaiian motifs are awesome! But, you don‚Äôt have to be a Hawaii lover to love this game. The playing pieces are universally attractive. The game pieces are great quality- sturdy cardboard game board with beautiful full color scenery on one side and the game grid on the other. Playing pieces are durable plastic with pretty graphic motifs. The game play is simple enough that my advanced 7 year old and 10 year old understood it in one game, yet challenging enough to keep both adults happy and entertained. It‚Äôs a little bit like dominoes but more complex and a lot more fun! Unlike a game like Monopoly that can draw on and on and get stale, or a game like Scrabble that can sometimes feel too much like more schooling after hours spent doing online virtual lessons, this game feels fresh, enjoyable, stress-relieving and a little bit like a vacation from all the craziness going on in the world today. I‚Äôm so happy I bought this and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a timeless game that‚Äôs a little outside of the box.

Quick to learn and play, yet requires strategy.
","

  If you are looking for a simple, light strategy game to play against one to three other players I would recommend this game.  In Latice Hawai'i tiles are laid out onto a Scrabble style board with the object of the game being to get rid of all your tiles. Tiles are placed side to side next to other tiles in such a way they match color for color, image for image or combo by matching pictures to one and colors to others; think Dominoes with pictures and color.  While it seems simple enough with concept of one turn one play, the board and placement of tiles allow you to earn gems that can be used for extra moves on a turn, potentially allowing you to use all 5 tiles on a turn. Wind tiles also allow for players to move pieces in a one move slide giving for even bigger gem earning combos.Pros:All pieces are strong and durable as they are made with plastic.Tiles are big and easily readable with colors not being so close can't tell what color is what.Game has a free app for phones to play against another person (No 3 or 4 person game)Easy to follow instructions.The box is amazing! I have many games and sadly some companies forget to put effort into the small things like the box as they do the game (sometimes the games also).  As can see in the photo posted Latice made sure to create a tray to fit fit all the pieces in the box nice and neat without worry about box bulging.Cons:While tiles are made from a hard plastic the images are stickers, so after much use they could fade. Would take some time but enjoy how BGG (I think) does their dice stile tiles with image inside the material. (Maybe one day they will do this for Latice like they do other games).  Overall I don't see this being a huge issue as can pick up and play from the sides and the stickers are surrounded by a lip thus protecting them more from peel out. Not star dropping worthy, as still getting good setup and those pieces can cost quite a bit (As much if not more than games themselves).Colors could still be an issue if color blind so might have issues if you are. (Orange, dark blue, purple, green, yellow). Again doesn't effect most but could be an issue. Not star dropping worthy.The board game is standard cardboard but nicely made.  This isn't something star taking worthy but would love to see a game made that will create a small lip on the board to hold pieces in place better when played.  While might add little time moving pieces that are ""Wind""ed would be helpful.OVERALL:While there are a couple little things that feel could be nicer, with what the game offers and how most others are, I feel it is worth the amount spent on it. So if wanting  to play a strategy versus game while still being able to have a conversation this is worth a spot on the shelf and more importantly the table.

Family fun game that plays quickly
","

  Family game night is one of our favorite things to do. We enjoy putting away the electronics and sit down at the table and dive into something that our family of all ages can play together.  With the different ages of our kids the games need to be quick and easy to understand.  This game hits both points.While it did take a couple times to actually understand the different ways to score points once we learned what we were doing wrong the game quickly became very a family favorite.  The game came packaged and all the pieces were durabale and organized. The card holders had deep set places so when packing up the game there were not lost pieces.  The tiles are sturdy and strong. Our toddler actually tried to snack on them and they held up to her slobber.I do encourage you to watch the videos about how to play the game and score gems but the game is fun. It is something that our 6 year old can play with us. It also is a quick game. Nothing long like Monopoly or Life where you just keep going and going. This game plays quickly and depending on how quickly tiles are being played can be played in under 40 minutes!Go ahead and hang ten. Grab this game and relax with the water themed board. A fun family game that makes you think ahead and plan your next move. You need to add this game to your collection today.

Mostly a huge improvement over previous version, great game.

  I previously owned the first edition of this game. For some reason they re-branded this game to Latice Hawaii instead of just leaving it called Latice. They should have kept the original name and it could have just been a 2nd edition. The name is actually quite bad now, but that doesn't really impact the game play. Compared to the original latice, the tiles are better, the coloring/art of the tiles is better, the board is far superior, the tile holders are nicer, and the game comes with a nice insert. On the other hand there are a few minor down grades over the previous version. The box itself is kind of bad. The quality isn't as nice, its a standard box but compared to the premium feel/thickness of the first edition, its a down grade. We also personally hate the box art on the new one, I wish they'd kept the previous box and art. Trying to figure out if i should put the new stuff in the old box. Then the half stones (blue ones, previously called moon stones at one point in time), they should be HALF the size of the sun stones, not the same size. The previous version had them as half the size, idk why they changed this.As to the game play, its a fun little game. Likely great for kids/family. Its simple to pickup and while the game play isn't complex it has enough choice to keep you interested when you just want a light abstract game to play. My wife and I really enjoy Latice and it'll likely stay in our collection for a long time.

Fun, quick family game
","

  This is a light, fun game that is easy to teach.  My 8 year old grasped the concepts in a few minutes and we were able to start our first game right away.  The game does have some strategy, but it is not too deep.  I was surprised that, though I had a leg up on my son due to years of gaming experience, I didn't have too high a leg up on my son.  He was able to make great strategic moves on his own.  I was ""taking it easy"" on him for our first game, and he ended up beating me because I waited too long to ""catch up.""  The game is also fairly quick; we have played a few games, and each one was less than half an hour.I must say that, for the price, the game quality is fantastic:* The board is thick enough cardboard that I am not concerned over its longevity.  I also like that the company put their game artwork on the backside of the board, instead of just having a solid black surface.* The tile trays are a nice, translucent blue acrylic that is very pleasant to the eye and matches the theme.* The included gems, yellow ""sunstones"" and blue ""half stones"", are a fun experience.  Having physical representations, instead of cardboard tokens, is a nice tactile element added to the game.* The tiles are a little thin, with stickers on each one, but I am surprisingly OK with them.  The sticker area is recessed, so I don't have any concern about them coming off after repeated handling.  And, honestly, I don't think making them heavier duty would accomplish much.Overall, this is a really fun game and I am glad I picked it up for our family.

Group Solitare anyone?
","

  The game is beautiful. The tiles, board, instructions, etc. are well done and colorful. The game, however, just isn't all that fun: the wind tiles are overpowered and there's no way to prevent your opponent from doing anything.  It's like group solitaire, which tells you all you need to know.  I may play it again with younger kids, say ages 6 to 10 who aren't into strategy yet.

My 4 year old dominates at this game.

  I bought this game because of it's rewards, and it looked like something my daughter could learn to play.  With the pandemic it's been a struggle to keep our children active, but away from the screen.  I've been desperately looking for ways to spend time with her that will also have the added benefit of keeping me entertained as well.This game has been awesome.  It took a few times and some patience, but 4 year old daughter has picked-up how to play this game.  We started out by removing the wind tiles from play and then eventually added them back in once she got the hang of how to play.The game initially plays really easily.  You just match ties like dominos and or scrabble, but then the addition of the stones and windtiles adds stackable complexity to the strategy of how the game can be really played out.The build quality is excellent!  The tiles are really well-made hard plastic while the boards and stands are also very rigid and well made.  No cardboard that will bend and distort here.Overall happy with the purchase.  Still haven't officially beaten my daughter yet ( my streak is 0-8), but looking forward to playing more games in the future with her.

What a great family game!

  First off, I did receive a coupon against part of the price of the game. I have eyed this game since December. We did not buy it last year as our son is still pretty young. But, I wish we would have!To begin with, they did an amazing job on the packaging. It‚Äôs not a cheap game by any means. It‚Äôs a quality product!!The instructions and super clear and precise. They troubleshoot with you about possible problems. And they also offer tips. The setup is easy!!In case math is not a strong point, the instructions break down how many pieces are dealt to each player.We‚Äôve played as a family, which has been great. I cannot wait until the end of social distancing and we can play against adult friends too. The game is challenging for adults, with the extra options available through the tips. But, the basic game can be played by kids.I‚Äôd recommend this game for sure!  It‚Äôs high quality!  Super details. And the concept is new and refreshing.

Fun and unique family game, extremely nice game pieces
","

  This is a fun, kid-friendly mix of Qwirkle and Scrabble. I‚Äôm not the best at figuring out how to play a new game, but I was able to and taught it to my kids fairly quickly. They are 5 and 8. The 5 year old definitely isn‚Äôt going to win anytime soon, but he enjoyed playing and understood the concept of matching pictures or colors to get sun and moon stones. The sun and moon stones are awesome. They are multi-faceted plastic ‚Äújewels‚Äù that is the highlight of the game for any kid. The tiles are really high quality, too. They didn‚Äôt skimp on pieces by any means. As long as you keep the pieces together, these things are indestructible and beautiful.I don‚Äôt really get the Hawaii theme, but it‚Äôs unique. One thing that would make it better would be some sort of story behind it that gives you more purpose and ties in the theme.We‚Äôve actually only tried the young kids‚Äô version, and I am excited to add in the cloud tiles that let you shift pieces to score more points. I can definitely see how that would make the game infinitely more interesting to adults. Haven‚Äôt you always wished you could move scrabble pieces around?

Easy to learn, but also has strategy
","

  Let's start with product quality. The box itself is very nice with magnetic flap cover. Box art is pretty cool. Inside there's a plastic tray to allow all the game pieces to be nearly organized. All the pieces are plastic which is fine to me. The tiles are very nice, not some flimsy paper or cardboard. The little stone pieces look pretty cool; my 4 year old really likes holding and looking at them. The game board is cardboard, with nice printed graphics. IMO, product quality is very good.I played this game with my 4 year old. The rules are simple, so it was easy for me to explain the rules to him. He was able to understand the concept within a few minutes of playing. I think this allowed him to come up with strategies instead of trying to remember the rules. The tile colors and shapes are easily distinguishable. To me it's similar to Dominos or Othello in that the concept is simple and straightforward, but there's room to incorporate strategy.Overall, I think it's a great game.

  This game captured our attention because of the claim to be color-blind friendly since both our young boys are. This game was a hit with the 4 year old and all the way to the adults. It took a second to grasp the concept but after that, everyone was fully engaged. The gems were extra exciting to the boys as well. The game‚Äôs packaged nicely which helps with maintaining pieces.  It was throughly enjoyed by all ages and color did not impact anyone from playing. This will be a fun strategy game to pull out on rainy days for our kids for a long time!

  Edit: After my initial review, Customer Service finaly got in touch with me and did a good job of hearing my concerns and doing what they could to make things right. I have improved my rating to reflect not only my happiness with their service but also to reflect my honest impressions with what i consider to be a wonderful board game.Original review:I have experience playing older versions of this game. I was excited to see their newest version, Hawaii. The quality of mine was lacking however. Many of the stickers were placed crooked on the tile pieces. My box had a cut along its front surface presumably cause when someone opened a case of games and dug their razor in a little too deep. I contacted the company via their link, but got no response. Mechanically, this is a wonderful game. I was just a little disappointed with the quality control of this particular version.

  The first thing you notice the moment you open the box is this is a very pretty game. It has the blue ocean feel of Hawaii. Then the tiles for the game are both sturdy and well made (so that they will last) and have nice Hawaiian style pictures on them also. It even has the added touch of the rounded blue tile holder to use instead of just laying your tiles face down on the board. The gameplay itself is simple; you match your tiles to surrounding tiles similar to an Uno game (you match the color or the picture). There is an extra bit of strategy in how you use the Wind Tiles to move the tiles on the board to allow you to place some of the ones in your hand. Also, you learn how to save and use the colored stones to your advantage to get more Wind Tiles or extra turns. All and all, this is eye-catch, easy to learn, and fun. I recommend it.

  As suggested in other reviews, we watched videos as well as reading to help us learn the rules. They are a bit complicated at first, but we all caught on quickly. Our 7-year-old grandson figured out a move we hadn't imagined but seems to fit those rules, and that made playing even more fun. There's both luck and strategy involved. He wins an overwhelming majority of the time. It was a hit with both him and the adults, so we played again and again during the holidays.

  I have been waiting for my son to be old enough to get this game. He's 7, so I thought I tried this game with him and he was able to follow the rules and play it right away. What I like the most about the game is the strategic thinking involved, with possibility to match not only by color, but also by shape. And add a little math and micro economic to it by earning half stone, sun stone and trading them. Last is the wind tile. I love this because it makes my son to think how to create an opportunity for him to match more tiles and get more sun stones.Note: I received this product with discounted price promotion but the feedback is based on my own experience playing this game with my son.

Really Fun Game
","

  My husband and I have been enjoying playing together. We played for the first time yesterday, and we played at least 4 or 5 rounds...so a LOT. I really hate games that are all chance so and am always on the lookout for logic/strategy games. This one fit the bill. There is a bit of chance, but this game is majority strategy if you equally divide up the wind tiles. I personally enjoy brain games more, and it's even better when I can use them when tutoring students, as well. I like that there's a kiddy version where you can use the same materials but simplify the rules for the younger crowd. The more we played yesterday, the more strategy we used as we became more comfortable with the rules. We'll definitely be playing again soon. It was a a lot of fun. I did receive a discount as a part of a promotion, but this opinion is honest. I honestly don't know if I would have bought it otherwise because I already have so many games, but I'm really glad I did because it's a great addition to my collection.

I‚Äôm leaving this review purely because it‚Äôs deserved.This board game has a level of quality I haven‚Äôt seen in a LONG time. The board itself is thick and sturdy. The pieces are smooth‚Äîyou don‚Äôt have to twist them out of a plastic grid like so many other board games which then leaves that nub at the edge of the pieces. They also have a nice weight to them. The graphics are pleasing and the colors are beautiful. The racks are sturdy and a beautiful clear blue color, and the gems are pretty and fun to play with. The design and quality alone make this game a pleasure to play.The game itself is easy to learn, and there is a video explaining the rules very clearly. Once my family started to play, we quickly found that it definitely required strategic thinking which was fun.

  This is one of the best designed board games we have. The pieces and board look great, everything is very sturdy. Even down to the design of the box, this thing looks great. The rule book takes 10 minutes max to read through the entire thing, and you‚Äôre ready to play. My wife and I have played probably a dozen games of it, replay-ability is really great too. Easy enough for kids to play, yet plenty of strategy for adults. The only downside I can find is that setup does take a little bit of time since there are 84 pieces that have to be mixed up, but that just comes with the nature of the game.

We feel it‚Äôs a perfect combination of strategy and luck.Note 1: we always play the ‚Äòbalanced‚Äô way where we distribute the wind tiles equally among players. Otherwise it gets really unfair.Note 2: the one thing we feel this game could use is some bags for the tiles. Each player should have their own bag to hold their tiles in.

  We have played this game 5 or so times since it arrived last week. It is a fast paced game where you are trying to match colors and shapes to score points and get rid of your tiles first.It reminds me a little of qwirkle but different in terms of building lines for rewards. In this game, you are rewarded for being surrounded by similar shapes and colors on all sides of the tiles you play versus making lines that contain all six colors or shapes.There is also the rewards- sun and water tokens for bonuses that let you play additional tiles to get rid of your tiles faster.

  I bought Lattice Hawaii during a promotion, even though I hadn't heard of it before. I've been running a board game club with students at my school this year, and thought something light would be welcome. I was pleasantly surprised how fun the game was. It's very light, can be taught in just a couple of minutes. But there are some strategic decisions to be made with a satisfying end. Even though players draw tiles every turn at random, luck isn't a big factor.Player interaction is good, not aggressive but it's definitely possible to ruin someone else's opportunities while pursuing your own.Players who like Azul or Carcassone will probably like Lattice Hawaii. It is lighter than either of those, but has what makes them both fun for me.

  Really like the game but it came short one blue tile holder.  While there's a space for it there was no holder.

Consequently our 4th player had to find a box to rest hus tiles on so others can't see them. That was a not ok for a game of thus cost and for its reviews.

A review for those playing with two people.
","

  This review is written specifically for those playing as a 2 player game. Mysterium is a beautiful clue giving and partner solving game where your partner will play the part of two psychics trying to figure out the who, where and how (what object) a crime was committed. To add difficulty in a 2 player game your partner plays the part of two psychics versus the usual one. The person playing the ghost will give the psychics clues in the form of surreal picture cards. From those cards the psychic tries to figure out who the ghost is pointing to, where, and finally what object was used to commit the crime. If you make it to the end stage you have narrowed it down to two suspects each with their own location and weapon. The ghost then gives three cards to her partner and from there must guess which is the correct suspect. As a two player game Mysterium is enjoyable but if you play just a few rounds you and your partner will become familiar with certain cards associated with certain suspects/locations/weapons. Once you have tuned in to each other you will have established a visual shorthand. There is an expansion set with some additional cards which will be helpful in keeping the game fresh, but I suspect more expansions will be needed to keep the game going. The game is still fun for two players but the sweet spot seems to be with four psychics and one ghost. There are are more minds at play, and the clairvoyance track comes into play which adds another dimension of fun and difficulty and the end stage. You don't use the clairvoyance track with just two people. Overall I enjoyed this as a two player game, but I have already ordered the expansion set and since there aren't many cards in the expansion, I'm hoping more are released. Recommended for two players, but expect limited replay once both people become familiar with the cards.

Love the game, instructions could use work
","

  We love this game! We've played it 8 times since getting it. Which is enough times for each person to play the ghost once/twice and we love it! It's definitely in our board game playing rotation now.Style of game:- A more adult, more fun. more challenging version of Clue.- Co-opPositives:- Great theme, we even dimmed the lights to set the mood- Good, quality components.- Beautiful artwork- Fun to play for both sides of the table. Sometimes when games have 1 person that plays as something different than the others, once side ends up not having as much fun. That isn't the case with this game.- Age rating seems pretty close. We played with a 12 year old and sit was good for her, challenging but fun. She even asked to play it again the 2nd night. She did have a little more fun and easier time at the ghost, but I think everyone will feel that way.- Game play is pretty easy to understand, once you make it through the instructions.Negatives:- Instructions could be easier to follow. It took a while to learn because of that. We watched a video though, I'd recommend that.- The screen for the ghost is a little too tall so it makes it hard to look over and see the rest of the cards on the table.- Good replay value if you play with different people every 5 or so times. If it's the same group of people I could see this becoming slightly repetitive.Personal notes:- I wouldn't play this with someone you have never met or don't know being the ghost. It relies a lot on people's interpretations of the cards and if you have no concept of the thought process of the person playing ghost it could become frustrating, very fast.- New players should play as ghost first. For us, it seemed to go a lot better that way.

  This had been recommended to me and it seemed like something my family would enjoy so I waited until it was on sale. I'm really glad I did because at full price I would have felt ripped off. The setup for this game takes forever. Cards have to be matched with other cards multiple times (according to the numbers on the backs) and the layout is really big and confusing which makes it hard to see certain things depending on where you're sitting. We weren't able to attach the hand to our clock, the plastic pieces wouldn't clip together no matter how many people tried. And the cards themselves are quite dark. The company recommends playing with some mood lighting on but I have no idea how you would see anything at all considering we had a hard time even in a brightly lit room. And the rules are so awkwardly written, you would be better off watching an instruction video. We've played three times and had to have the rules nearby because what happens at the end is rather convoluted but could be easily simplified. When the rules told us to do something, we all kept asking ""Why? Wouldn't it be simpler and better if...?"" over and over.The game is super, super easy. Our 5 year old won the first game we played all by himself with no help. Our 8 year old was the ghost in our second game and we never made a wrong choice. It has the air of complexity but it's even easier than Clue. I know a lot of reviews have stated that the vision cards are too vague but we haven't had that problem at all. And we discovered a flaw that guarantees a win which took the fun completely out of it and now there's no reason to ever play it again. This seriously needed to be playtested many more times before release to make it worth playing more than a few times. It very much feels like a first draft of the game rather than a finished, polished product.I really wanted to like this but you would be better off playing any other number of games with this theme.

Fun game, great artwork, quality components!
","

  This game is really fun! I have only played twice, first a 3 player game, then a 7 player one, and I was the ghost both times. It was definitely hard keeping a straight face when my friends were trying to figure out what the heck I was trying to tell them with my card choices! It did take a couple hours with the 7 of us, but 5 had never played this game (and some had never played anything other than Monopoly etc.), and the 3 player was over an hour, though part of that was reading/learning the rules. I look forward to playing as a psychic trying to interpret the ghost's clues, and while I have read that some people have played so often (presumably with the same people) that the cards are getting stale/predictable, there is an expansion that looks good (and you can probably supplement with Dixit cards too). The artwork is awesome and the components are good quality - I especially like the board the ghost uses. Fun game, definitely recommend

  This is one of the better examples of a party game done just right, I think. The game is extraordinarily simple, and easy to teach. One player is a ghost; the others are mediums trying to find out the circumstances of that ghost's murder. The ghost is unable to communicate in anything other than abstract images that are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. It's the ghost's job to figure out how to use those images to communicate either the person, place, or thing that the medium is currently searching for.Each medium, initially, has their own miniature mystery to solve, going through three steps starting with the person. At the end of the game, all of this information is combined together into a final guessing round as to which investigator's combination is the correct one - a thing that's randomly chosen by the ghost, and again communicated to the group using the Vision cards available.For a party game, this can actually be quite difficult. The Vision cards are often VERY abstract, and it will require some knowledge of how the players think to try to get them pointed in the right direction. You are all playing cooperatively, and while the investigators can freely talk among themselves about what they've seen, the ghost is required to keep silent, and not provide any tells. It makes for an extremely fun experience, but one that is definitely best in groups. It can be played two-player, but there different ways people interpret cards make it far better with more, and allow the ghost a little bit more room to use their cards with the expectation that the mediums can all help each other with their respective investigations.The components are decently made. The ghost's screen is a stand-out here, with each investigator having their own column with little pockets for the ghost to place cards. The pockets are a bit tight, making it hard to sometimes place and remove cards until they're broken in, but they feel quite sturdy. The little player pieces are made out of plastic and are a bit cheaply cast, but they get the job done. The timer is a clock made out of a few pieces of cardboard that you actually put together to stand free. Beyond that, everything else is either cards or thick cardboard chits.If you have a group that likes to do a bit of logical deduction mixed with some abstract thinking, this is a fantastic game. It's probably not something that holds up to multiple games in rapid succession, but as something to throw in the middle of a night, or just for giggles, it can make for some funny stories.

  Mysterium is an amazing game where all players work together to solve a crime.There is one player who plays as the ghost that attempts to tell other players (psychics) information about the crime using cards with artwork on them.The artwork is amazing and beautiful, and the gameplay is easy to grasp and interesting.I've found that this game isn't for everyone though. There are players who prefer more concrete gameplay and dislike the notion of having to ""interpret"" what a card given by the ghost could mean.

Somewhat like Clue, but a team atmosphere and a lot more fun!
","

  I'll start by saying I love Clue.Especially for what it is: an easy to learn game of deduction. When I heard about this game people said it was just a little like Clue, but a lot more to it. That's all true, but still an easy game to pick up.Can be played with 2-7 people (we've only played with 3 so far, but really looking forward to more people!). All of the players except one play the role of psychics who try to figure out the clues given by the other play, who plays the ghost. The first round, each player is trying to decipher the clues given by the ghost to figure out which suspect they're supposed to guess (each player will try to identify a different suspect). This gets repeated with locations, then weapons (just like Clue right?). The ""clues"" that the ghost gives out to each player are vision cards: abstract pictures that could be interpreted in many different ways. The ghost tries to give out these vision cards to each player based on which suspect on the board they're trying to guess, as each suspect/location/weapon card have extra things on them telling you about the location. While this is going on, each round other players can ""bid"" on whether a player correctly guessed their card. Bidding correctly gives them extra ""points"" which will give more clues for the end of the game.Players have a limited number of rounds to have all players guess their 3 cards (suspect/weapon/location). If all players guess correctly, then you work together to find out who the actual killer/location/weapon is used. The sets of three and put out and given a number (1-6, depending on how many players are in the game). The ghost secretly picks one of the sets and puts the number token for that set face down in front of everyone.  Then the ghost picks out 3 more vision cards: one representing the suspect, one the location, and one the weapon of the set chosen. Depending on how well players bid during the game, they get to look at one, two, or all 3 cards before they vote on who they think the right set is.  Most votes is what the group goes with, and hopefully is the correct answer.For people who don't like to think outside the box when it comes to clues may not enjoy this game. Right now I've only played it with my wife and 9 year old and they both dig the game, and helping to teach my son to think more outside the box on some things to find connections and be observant (note on the 2-3 player games, no bidding happens, there's always 4 psychics so players will play multiple people, and all 3 clues are revealed to everyone at the end). Really can't wait to play with 7 people to see how that goes, but recommend this to be added to the game shelf.

Perfect gateway game and spookily thematic
","

  Mysterium is a cooperative game where you're trying to receive clues from the recently deceased player acting as a helping ghost. Each player is assigned a person, location, and weapon. Through the ghost's visual clues, each player is attempting to decide which person, location, and weapon was assigned to them. Players are encouraged to discuss the clues with one another to form conclusions. The ghost cannot speak at all, however. If the group can't get each player to guess their assigned cards before the clock strikes the final round, everyone loses. The theme in this game is awesome. Halloween, rainy day, nighttime - any of these are a perfect setting. It plays up to 7, and it works. Be aware that any player playing as the ghost has the hardest job so it's recommended that first time players should avoid that role if possible, especially with higher player counts. I can't recommend the game for 2 or 3, it's just not that fun. 4-7 players is great though. It's thematic, cooperative, and easy to play. Winning isn't always the easiest in this game, but it keeps you coming back for more. Also, kids can easily play this too. No reading is necessary and it's not a horror-themed game, don't be fooled by the box art. No gore in the art. The only thing I'll say is to avoid learning from the rule book. It took us way too long to learn and setup for our first play. It's extremely wordy. Just go to Board Game Geek or Youtube for a tutorial. It'll save you time and it's easier.

Very good, very enjoyable game

  Mysterium is easy to learn and fun to play.  It is less strategy-based than a lot of the games I usually play.  I would say it is geared more to creative, artistic people than others who prefer games of strategy and/or luck.I can describe it as a combination of Forbidden Island, Clue, and Code Names.  In Clue, you must identify the murderer, the location, and the weapon.  You have to do the same in Mysterium.  One player plays as the ghost who was murdered.  The other players serve as psychics trying to figure out what happened (how the ghost died and by whose hand).  The ghost sends visions (picture clues) to each player.  The players must try to use those visions to guess which suspect, location, and weapon the ghost is referring to.  It's like Code Names...but instead of word association, this is image association.  This is a cooperative game.  Players can work together to try to decipher the ghost's visions.  At the end of the game, everyone wins or everyone loses (including the ghost).  So in that respect, it's like Forbidden Island.Definitely a fun game and worth playing.

You need the right people to really enjoy this game
","

  I would like to start by saying that I really enjoyed this game, however, you need to right set if people to play with. Thematically, it is similar to clue in the each person is trying to identify their person, place, and weapon, but that is where the similarities end. Whereas in clue you have a very methodical way of determining the right set, in this game you are trying to guess you person, place, or weapon based on ""visions."" These visions are cards that the ghost (kind of the game leader/clue giver) provides you with. They are highly abstract pictures that often will relate to what you are supposed to guess in a very vague way. This would be harder to play with a group of people house didnt know or younger children. Additionally, you really need to be able to think outside the box because the clues are very rarely obvious at first sight. That being said, once one person understands how to play and can be the ghost, anyone can join in, because the job of the guesser is quite simple.

  The physical contents of the game are of great quality! The game itself has a lot set up involved, but it is fun to play once you start.You and other players will act as the mediums/psychics trying to solve the murder of a ghost (played by another person). The ghost will hand out clues to each player from which you must make a choice about the murderer, location, and weapon. The ghost player has to decide on the clues (which are random picture cards) that best matches with the set of info for each individual player. It is really fun to see what kind of associations and the thought process of everyone involved in this game.I've only played a very simplified version of the game, but there are different ""difficulty"" levels for the game itself which is really nice for replay value.

  Bought this as a gift for a friend who is the head of our gaming group. We've played this a couple of times already and we all absolutely love it. The theme is easily immersible if you're into anything involving mystery, ghosts, seances, or random spookiness. The game play itself turned out to feel like a mixture between Clue, Dixit, and something entirely new to me. I loved the interaction between the ghost and the psychics. The game was full of non-verbal communication and very abstract artistic messages, which we somehow managed to grasp right from the very first game. The ghost is not supposed to speak at all, and can only provide hints and answers by knocking on the table - once for yes or twice for no. This was one of those games that helped us all learn a bit more about how each of the other gamers think around the table. If you have a ghost who is an established gamer and will not be overly stressed at having to guide everyone else in the room, this can be a very simple and rewarding experience for the psychic players. This game will be hitting our table pretty often, but I would recommend playing it with a larger group of players.

I've played this a dozen times and I didn't notice that the chair has a lion head emblem on the back!""Is the ghost showing you a picture of a knight chopping down a tower with a sword because they want to tell you the murder weapon is a sharp thing? Or a metal thing? or the candelabra because the tower is shaped like a candle?We've been playing this game at work and it's become our favorite team building exercise.  It's great to get children thinking laterally, too!  And since everyone wins or loses together, there's no possibility of people getting upset for losing.

  The contents of the box are pretty good, the artwork is nice and well thought out. The layout, unfortunately, is where the problems start. This game requires way too much play space if you follow the guidelines of the instructions. More than games like Betrayal House on the Hill.The gameplay itself is abstract where the ghost/spirit/random dead player is trying to get the players to use their psychic abilities to decern the when, where, and how of how that ghost was killed with vague clues that are limited to randomly drawn cards with pictures. The concept is great, but the mechanics of this abstract thought game ruin the fun almost immediately.If you want a frustrating almost senseless (not in the funny way) board game experience, get Mysterium. If you want an abstract game done right, get Dixit.

  We purchased this after watching the Polygon's Let's Play of this game. A game runs about 45 minutes to an hour depending on how fast your ghost is.Pros:-Cooperative Gameplay - no us vs them or secret undercover liars. Everyone wins or loses together.-Great for large groups, we had exactly 7 people and this was the game we played every night.-Well constructed game.Cons:-Ghost character does not get to participate in as much of the side chatter throughout the game.-Clipping together the clock was actually really difficult for us. The plastic piece is made to tightly bind the thick cardboard bits together and a lot of pressure was required to snap it into place.-Best played with a large group of people - I'd say 4 or more. Best with 6-7.

  I bought this game and an expansion pack as part of my nephew's 18th birthday gift.  When our whole family all got together a few weeks later, he taught us how to play.  Over the course of a week, we played the game multiple times; it's just that good.This is a great game where everyone is working together to solve a crime.  There's a playlist online of eerie music that we had to play in the background and we added some sound effects as well.  We pretty much ended up playing this game every evening long into the early hours; laughing constantly.I loved this game so much that I ordered my own copy and both expansion packs!

  We are a family of board game lovers, unfortunately most board games for a older audience can take up to 3+ hrs to play one game. *couch* *couch* Arkem Horror.I loved the idea of this game and begged my husband to let me have it. We ended up trying it out with a few friends one night and went through a couple rounds in about under 2ish hours (factoring in the time it takes to set up and read/learn the rules and become familiar enough to play) It was a straightforward and rather simple game, with a few hair pulling/hysterical moments thrown in. I especially loved the character that isn't allowed to speak a single word during the whole game, as my friends did as well, since I was that person, and I ""talk too much"".Either way, it's one of the quicker board games to play, but still has a little length to play. Would recommend definitely.

Dixit meets Clue
","

  We've been under quarantine from the coronavirus for a few days, so this game came at the most opportune time. I do recommend this game be played with someone who has already played it acting as the ""ghost."" The game is not difficult to learn but the wording on the instructions can be a bit hard to descipher at times. The box was designed very well and there is a place for almost every game piece. No need for little bags to help organize the pieces. It helps to organize the cards back into numerical order at the end of each game to make the next game easier to start.BackgroundThe premise of the game is that a murder took place a long time ago and you are a group of psychics who have come to do a seance. You summon a ghost who can only speak to you in pictures and you have 7 rounds to investigate different suspects. Each suspect will lead you to a person, a location, and a weapon. If you correctly guess all the suspects within the 7 ""hours"" of the seance, the ghost will provide you with the final clues as to who the actual killer is.GameplayThis is pretty smooth and easy to understand/explain when playing as a psychic. The ghost is the one doing all the work and has to sit behind a screen. Have your strongest player be the ghost for the first round to hash it out. The game takes about 40 minutes and was easy for even beginner boardgame players to figure out how to play. When playing as 2 or 3 player games, check the very last page for instructions as to how many psychics for each player to play with.

Top game: surreal and mindbending - theatrical and immersive!

  Impressive coop game, really cool for a family game night! So, you're a ghost who communicates visions to ""psychic mediums"" using vision cards, and they have to determine who killed you, where you were killed, and with what weapon. Very ""Clue-like"", but so much cooler! To knock the experience out of the park, take 2 or 3 smart phones and stream the Mysterium music (or whatever epic music you like) for the game. The fact that they'll be playing slightly out of synch around you makes the experience that much more immersive!But back to the game. The designers put a lot into the artwork which is really surreal - definitely a high quality game. The vision cards are very dream-like. Each vision card has multiple elements so be careful not to mislead the psychics!The way it's set up you can really get into it and jazz up the experience to any theatrical degree.Definitely recommend!

  After waiting a few months for this game, I've finally managed to play it three times in two weeks. I've played it with serious gamers, my wife and our mothers, and with teens. Each group had a good time.I won't summarize the rules, because that's easy enough to find elsewhere (like from the publisher's site):http://en.libellud.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=callelement&format=raw&item_id=1523&element=66b58ffc-c789-4cef-b9f1-2cb5226ebace&method=download&args[0]=4ba51578946c33ff9c21a9f248c5214f&Itemid=57What I will comment on is that this game really shines in one spectacular way: the mechanism (symbol matching), matches the story (the players are psychics, trying to communicate with a ghost). You see, the ghost player is forced to communicate with a limited number of images, and the players, well, they almost have to be psychic to figure out what the ghost is trying to say!Why does my review score it with 4 stars? If you examine the theme too closely, it kind of falls apart. During the game, each player is solving a different mystery, but the ghost is only interested on one; his own death. This is easily fixed by saying that the ghost is confused, and needs help remembering from the psychics/players.Another problem is with gaining clairvoyant points which help with the end game. In a large game, it is VERY difficult to get enough of them. You might want to follow the rules for 3-5 players if you are playing with a larger group.Don't let my quibbles deter you. This is a very good game, and I'm glad to have it in my collection.

  I loved this game. It's very very beautifull, cards are awsome, and the game is easy and interisting.  Even my mother and friends who have never played boardgames could easily learn and play at the first time. It's very simple but also entertaining. The most dificult part is to be the ghost, so you better let someone who has already played be the Ghost if it's your first time. Even who doesnt really like Dix It (wich is a similar game), likes Mysterium a lot. They say Mysterium is a Dix It with a purpose, and prefer this game for this reason...because they feel there's a point to play it, cause you have a main goal.The only thing is that some cards (just a few) may be easily connected to the other. Like the Magician (suspect card) can be easily related to a  vision card that is full of rabbits. Maybe this happened to me because I played a lot of times with same persons. I played it a lot since I bought and I felt like buying the expansion already.And.... : if you know the Dix It mechanism of playing,you have meeples and a pointing board you might even play Dix It just with Mysterium cards!

","

  Although the rules seemed lengthy and confusing, once we ran through the game once, we picked it up fairly quickly for the second round. (It might also help that we watched Wil Wheaton's Tabletop run-through on YouTube.) It's similar to Clue, except you don't talk back and forth or write anything down. There's been a murder, and one player plays as the Ghost, who is trying to give picture clues to the clairvoyant/psychic guests(the other players) to determine WHO killed you, in what ROOM, and with what OBJECT. As one of the psychics, you're trying to guess who/where/what by (hopefully) picking up on the right details in the clue cards the Ghost gives you each round. This is a team game; the psychics all vote on which who/where/what scenario (of 3) they think is the right one, and if they all get it right, they win. If they don't all guess the same way, they lose and the ghost remains unavenged.

  I enjoy this game, and appreciate the cooperative concept, but the ghost is lonely (I sometimes add an ""assistant"").  The players are generally bored waiting for the visions to be chosen, and the ghost can get frustrated with the small sample of vision cards available (can get stuck with useless cards for a long time).  With some modifications, we've made this a fun game to play.  No reading required so good for younger players as well.

  The artwork and detail is just wonderful in this game. To keep track of turns in the games, rather than doing just a timer or checkbox, they actually have a tiny clock that you put together, and player tokens are tiny crystal balls. The ghost can also ""dump"" cards and marks the times they do so with little tokens in the shape of ravens, and each raven is different. Just wonderful detail and spooky atmosphere.The gameplay is solid. It's like a supernatural mix of Dixit and Clue. We already have played this several times since getting it, and it's become a real winner. Much easier to learn than, say Arkham Horror, but still very fun.We haven't gotten to the point that it's been a problem, but the only potential problem is replay value. We already have some in-jokes worked around the cards, which can impact future games.Still well worth the money!

  Art is lovely. Card and component quality is good. Gameplay is fun, although I had 1 player in 1 of my 3 groups describe it as ""a bit slow"". The theme worked well. It's important that people who have not played the Ghost before understand how sometimes the Ghost's hands are tied and they just don't have great cards to play for a particular player; we had a couple times where players eviscerated the Ghost for handing out confusing clues, but they didn't understand that the Ghost was caught in a bad situation and only had 1 or no Crows left for the entire game; again, not a problem if players understand up front. Replayability is moderate, each game is more or less like the last, and even though the deck is huge you do start seeing the same cards popping up pretty regularly (the expansion helps with this), but you can adjust difficulty for added difficulty.

The ghosts job is to send visions to the psychics, who then have to pick a person, place, and murder weapon from the clues in the vision. The best part is that this game is cooperative, so your ultra competitive friend who likes to hide monopoly money in her pockets doesn't gloat for a week when she wins. That's right, Sandra, I'm calling you out.A few things to know before you buy:-Learning this game can take some time. It is a lot to setup, and there are a lot of rules to be aware of. It includes instructions, obviously, but I also recommend finding a Youtube video online describing how to play. There is also a mobile app version of this game that holds your hand as you learn; it costs a few dollars but you get to play Mysterium on the go! Worth it!-This game takes up space. A lot of space. Be prepared.-Putting everything back in the box isn't as straightforward as you would thing. Pay attention to what goes where, you'll thank me later.

Great Conversation Game
","

  This game has been a blast. The asymmetric gameplay of one player as the ghost and the others as the team of psychics is a pleasurable experience for both sides.The cards and pictures that are used to give clues are wild and crazy depictions of dreams that really offer a lot to digest, discuss, and depict. It creates a lot of fun dialog about if the ghost is trying to be literal with a clue or if they had to really stretch to have something to give.  As the ghost, its a laugh to listen to how the psychics try to analyze and critique your clues.Gameplay is simple repetitive mechanic of ghost giving clues and then psychics deciphering clues, but it makes for a simple to learn experience that is great for many new players. The discussions are timed so it keeps things moving at a nice pace. As stated the cards are wildly unique and the mix of weapons, places, and whodunits is varied that every gameplay experience will be different though mechanics are always similar.The only drawback is the game is best played with 3-7. It's way more fun with multiple people conversing and discussing on the psychics side. Playing with 2, though still fun, isn't quite the same experience.It's a great game as an opening act for a game night with friends.  Even if you're an experienced board game player, this is a great title that can always be used as a starter game since its light in mechanics but still offers a lot of variety and uniqueness to each play-through.

Not bad but there are other collaboration games I prefer.
","

  Played it in a small group a few times to try it. Learning takes a minute but is manageable. The best part of the game is one person trying to think like you do and giving you a card with an eclectic picture, hoping you see the same things they focused on. Then they watch as you end up focusing on everything but the one thing they anticipated you would see. The hope drains from their eyes as you talk about a teeny detail they hadn't even noticed, and completely miss the clue that they were so desperately trying to give to you. They are the ghost and must be silent, despite their stifled laughter as they watch you flail like an idiot against the timer.The whole game could just be that. Eventually we didn't really bother with the set up and buildable clocks that only added so much to the game.

Super fun
","

  This game is so much fun with a big group of people. Initially learning the game was difficult since none of us had played before and there are a lot of rules, but once you get the gist of it, it's easy to toss out some of the more confusing rules and just play the game. The main idea is that one person is the ghost and sends visions to the other players to help them figure out who killed them, where they were killed, and what weapon was used.  I've been told it is similar to Clue although I haven't played that myself.

Super engaging game that creates conversation
","

  We just discovered this game around Christmas, and have played it constantly with tons of our friends and family. My wife loves being the Ghost and handing out clues. It's gotten more play than most of our other games these past six months--so much so that we just bought one of the expansions. Art is beautiful, the game is simple for teaching to new players (so long as they're mediums the first time and not the ghost), and the fact that it's a collaborative game rather than a competitive one is a HUGE plus. I'd highly recommend this one.

Fun, but certainly not the best game
","

  This game is fine and it was a new addition to our massive board game collection. We love non-mainstream games like Power Grid, Settlers of Catan, 7 Wonders, etc.Overall, this wasn't anywhere near the best game we've ever played but certainly isn't the worst. It has a long set up and is, at times, almost too difficult to be fun. Perhaps that's just a side effect of the person we have playing the ""Ghost"" but the cards sometimes are too nondescript and make it hard to understand what the card is trying to clue us into.

  It's like Clue on a mild acid trip. Trying to interpret the clues leads to some of the most amazing and off-the-wall theories (some of which actually turn out to be right). This is a great game to play with friends whose trains of thought you can kind of grasp, but might be a little more difficult if the person playing the ghost is someone you don't know very well. I absolutely love it and would recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining board game.

Great aesthetics, Gameplay is a little weak.
","

  The game is basically a mash up of Dixit and Codenames. If your group loves both,, you will probably love Mysterium. The aesthetics are beautiful. The artwork is top notch, and the game pieces are very well made, definitely one of the best set of game pieces I've owned in the last few months for me.The biggest hinderance to a full 5 star rating is the set up time required, and the overall flow of the game. In regards to game time: it takes an inordinate amount of time to set up a game, compared to the time it takes to play. My group found it takes 5-10 minutes to set a game up, whereas it takes about 20 minutes to play. You spend nearly a third of your time just setting up a game, which in my mind, is ridiculous. Compare it to any of your other favorite games, and see just how much set up time is required. Furthermore, the game itself is hard to feel challenging, and the flow feels a bit off. There's the weird final round of guessing, where if everyone gets their correct set of suspect/location/weapon correct, you have to pick one and see if you can get the whole group to agree one last time. It feels like it was added just to pad out the game. It doesn't feel like a grand finale at the end, but rather a whimper of formality.

Beautifully surreal and calculatedly inscrutable fun
","

  What a game! It's ""Clue"", only upgraded to a higher level of social interaction and possessing creatively asymmetrical cooperation. The role of the player being the ghost is quite unique, and possibly a reason onto itself for purchasing the game. Everyone should play as the ghost at least once, what an experience. And the artwork! Beautifully surreal and calculatedly inscrutable. When set up on the table with the ghost's large screen, the clock, the sand-glass timer, the cards, and all its other bits; it really looks quite wonderful. But the best is how social a game it is: everyone constantly wondering and hinting and laughing, and yes, even bickering about what the hell the ghost could possibly be hinting at. And that doesn't end when the game does. Our impromptu postmortems with the ghost :) after the game are just as much fun as the game-play itself. Very enjoyable.

Narrow Audience

  Most people I have played with moderately enjoy this game (more so when they play as the ghost).  It is hard/unenjoyable for those who have a hard time grasping abstract ideas (my husband and my father).  It lends itself to fanfare, setting the theme with music and roleplaying which, I'm told, makes it much more fun.  A little too narrow of an audience for most gaming groups.

Terrific, cooperative game
","

  This is one of the most fun games my family has played. My youngest is six and was able to participate, but it's not so easy that adult players grow bored. The difficulty of the game really does rely on the ability of the ghost to convey the visions to the psychic well enough to move to the next challenge. I also love that it's a game where the players have to cooperate and play as a team instead of playing against each other (we have some younger, sore losers at times). The artwork is really outstanding, and I can see this becoming an immediate favorite for our game nights.

Love this game

  Love this game, it is a great game if you prefer a board game where you work collectively together. One person ""guides"" the group as a ghost and and the others are clairvoyants and the ghost is trying to tell them how they died. It is similar to Clue but you all are trying to help one another. It is a collective game that is really fun both as a clairvoyant and the ghost. Low competitive game so if you have friends/family that don't like strategy games that pit people against each other consider getting this game. Beautiful board and game pieces which is an added bonus.

  This is a type of new age Clue. The theme works really well, and with it being a Co-Op game the experience is much more satisfying than Clue. The Ghost Mechanics can be a bit daunting and there are many moving parts to that role, but the game is satisfying and fun to play with people of all levels of depth playing board games. I've played it with people who strongly dislike board games and it's quickly taken to them and got them pulled right into the experience with the group.

  This game is 100 percent cooperative, so if you do not like that in a board game, you will not like this. One player plays as a ghost who gives out picture cards to the other players. Using those cards the players are suppose to guess who, what, and where a murder happened. I have enjoyed this the few times I have played it, but I could see it being too easy with someone you know too well. I really liked playing as the ghost and listening to the discussions on why I gave individual cards. It‚Äôs kind of funny to hear someone on the right path, and then go completely off in a different direction.

  This game is okay. We played this game many of times and everyone thinks they can be the best ghost until it is their turn and they are frustrated with their options. This game plays like clue almost where you are trying to guide people with cards to figure out the murder suspect, location, and weapon by only using random abstract cards that tend to have very little in common with such suspect location and clue. We found it a fairly cooperative game and fairly enjoyable but I am rating it 4/5 because we felt like the game just missed something... but overall still great game and we will revisit this in the future

Inappropriate cards

  I bought this game as a gift for my 8 year old daughter who loves games.  I was expecting lots of gross foods--but I was surprised at the inappropriate cards--eyeball, human burger, blood salsa, and fresh brains.  Those are not foods that typical people find in their refrigerators.  We do not practice cannibalism.  She was very upset when I suggested that we just take out those cards.  I seriously wonder who thinks that those cards are appropriate for kids.  The rest of the game is funny, but I wish I would have looked through the cards before I gave it to her.

Quick and easy, great for families; see NOTE for box lid opening hack
","

  Taco vs Burrito plays a lot like Uno, but with funnier cards.  Much like Uno, you can sabotage your opponents, or be nice; whatever suits your playstyle.  You can totally play with only 2 players, but more people means more opportunities for mischief and mayhem!Pros:- easy to learn how to play (each Action card tells you how to use it)- setup and teardown are super simple (no dice or color-coded gamepieces to lose and step on later)- gameplay is quick and easy (10 min/game; no Monopoly marathons here!)- amusing food ingredients (creative/gross foods will give you a chuckle)- once you master the basic game, there are many variations that keep the game interesting- my 7-year-old does enjoy this game a lot, and I don't mind playing 1-on-1 (it's more strategic and exciting with more people)Cons:- the game box is ridiculously hard to open, for some reason.  See NOTE below for a quick hack fix.- I feel like there should be more ingredient cards. Perhaps that is what is in the expansion pack?- you choose to build either a taco or a burrito, but the choice does not affect gameplay *at all*. I feel like it should, though. If I think up a game variation that does, I'll post it here on a later edit.- considering you're basically just getting a pack of funny cards, I feel that $20 is a little expensive. I would have been fine with paying $15 or so.Bottom line: This game is easy to learn and fun to play. It's great for when you want to play one or a few quick games with family or friends. It would make a good gift, especially if you can get it on sale.NOTE: The game box lid creates a vacuum or something that makes the box really hard to open. So what I did was take  a square of clean aluminum foil (about 1 foot x 1 foot) and fold it over itself several times to make a strong strip roughly 1 foot long and 2 inches wide. Then place the strip horizontally *underneath the plastic tray* in the box (please see the attached photo). Tuck the leftover ends under the box bottom to hide the aluminum strip when the box is closed and in storage.When you want to open the box, just untuck the ends, balance the box on your leg (or have the other person hold it), and pull *downwards* on both of the ends of the aluminum strip *equally*. This downward motion will push the plastic tray upwards, and the lid will magically float up and pop off. You don't need to use a lot of force! Alternatively, you could just open the box normally, as the aluminum strip breaks the vacuum seal and makes it much easier, but where's the fun in that? :)If you found this review to be helpful, please click on the 'Helpful' button below so more people like you can find it. Thank you!

I laughed myself into an asthma attack!
","

  Ok, this game is legitimately hilarious, and devious enough to bring out people's competitive nature! It says a round is roughly 15 minutes, but we kept reshuffling the trash pile, so the round wound up being closer to 45.It's SUPER easy to play -- you literally deal the cards and start playing because instructions are written on the cards themselves. We had a few scenarios where we had to adapt as the game went on, namely with the ""Food Fight"" action card. The deck has so many action cards that it was hard to draw ingredient cards for the Food Fight, so we decided that action cards are just Null rather than to keep drawing until you hit an ingredient. Simple adjustment.The game itself is perfect for family night since it's easy to play and the gross ingredients appeal to a kid's sense of humor. But my friends and I are all mid-30s and we still had a blast! After the third time getting ""Health Inspector,"" one friend started cursing. Our other friend, who is a notorious trash-talker when she plays spades, called me a ""heifer"" when I smacked her, once again, with Tummy Ache. Did I mention this was a faith-based group for graduate students? LOLI've already bought the expansion pack and we're looking forward to playing again at our next monthly potluck. I might filter out a few of the action cards to help balance the deck with the Food Fight issue, but that's my only potential ""negative"" from the entire game.

Poorly written rules
","

  First of all, the game is cute. Good ideas from a creative kid, I'm happy to say that. However, it's not the kid's job to make sure that this game works as a game. This game's rules are so poorly written that we have to create our own rules just to play it. A good rulebook would address all possibilities and this one barely addresses any.First of all, the Food Fight card is incredibly confusing. Players compete in a fast-paced showdown and draw cards until they draw points cards, then compete to see who gets the highest point value card. But it's the details that matter. What happens when you draw an action card? According to the game rules, you can choose to play the action card immediately. But what about the point values? Do we keep drawing? Do we stop after drawing an action card? What happens if the action card is dependent on other things? What happens if we never draw a point value card? One time I got 12 action cards in a row and that literally wiped the whole deck. Is a Food Fight card supposed to basically end the game?And there's the fact that the entire purpose of the game, Taco vs Burrito, is completely pointless. There is no game mechanic that actually cares about whether you choose Taco or Burrito. It's aesthetic only. Why is the name of the game literally an aesthetic feature?To make it worse, there are even contradicting rules. The quick rules cards say that you can only put cards into your own burrito. But the full rulebook says you can put cards into OTHER peoples' burritos as well. Which one is it???? Makes a pretty big difference.This game is good if you're playing with children who don't understand board games much, and just want some dumb silly gross food fun. But if you're literally ANYBODY except a child, avoid this game until they clean up their rulebook.

  My granddaughters aged 5 and 8 love this game! The best thing about it is the adults have as much fun as the kids. The ""No Bueno"" cards are similar to the ""Nope"" cards in Exploding Kittens but the other action cards are original and perhaps even more fun. It is super-quick to learn and kids don't really have to read to play; it only takes them one round to know what all the cards do. My 5 year old beat the pants off us and we were hysterical with all the twists and turns. My only complaint is that I wish more could play, especially as $19.95 is a lot for a card game.

Fun but the game is not fully fleshed out
","

  The game is fun, my complaint (sort of) is their are basically no rules.  Basic gameplay instructions but no fleshed out details.  My family and I had to make up our own ""house rules"" for almost everything.  Actually, that was in some ways fun and creative for us to do, but what will happen if we ever play with anyone else who has the game?  We will have to negotiate and argue over each others rules (not fun).  I'll give an example: A player plays a minus card and the other plays a no bueno card.  What happens?  The game does not inform you.  Is it just a block and we can both keep our cards? we decided no.  Does it mean the player who blocks loses their no bueno card? Does the player who tried to play the minus just return it to their hand? do they still get to play something else? Or, does the attempted play count as their turn? Still what about the minus card? Is it considered played and discarded in the discard pile? Same question for the no bueno block card.  We decided that both cards are considered played and placed in the discard pile and the attempted play of the minus card counts as the players turn.  My point in writing this, is you will have to decided about things like this for quiet a bit until you figure out for yourselves all the different scenarios and card plays.  Really, all these things should be written out in a real rule book.I'll add one last thing, we find the game is fun played in a pre-determined number of rounds with the dealing passing around from player to player to keep it balanced.  You add up the scores of each round to determine a winner.  Adds a nice additional strategy level to each round game play.Still fun game.  Interesting strategy game.

  I purchased Taco Vs. Burrito for my middle school classroom. Even the most difficult to engage, eye-rolling 13 year old loves it!  I can group 4 students who do not get along for a game of Taco Vs. Burrito and they will be giggling together within minutes. Competitive enough to hold their attention yet simple enough to not require adult intervention, Taco Vs. Burrito is highly recommended by this teacher for the classroom!

Some strategy but probably more fun with a younger group.
","

  This is another game we tried today. Created by a 7 year old. It has some strategy but not nearly as fun as deck 10 for our family. Better for younger kids like 4/5-10ish maybe. They will like the silly food combinations. And it‚Äôs a fast game because it‚Äôs a small deck. And parents who play with them will like the bit of strategy in it. My youngest is 13. I don‚Äôt feel it was worth $20. I‚Äôd say more $10. But still a clever game. It would make a great gift.  The directions could be a little more clear on things like do you look at cards before you steal, and that your original 5 cards start in your hand not your taco. But it worked out as we played.

Not that fun
","

  I was hoping for a fun, easy to learn game.  There isn't much to this game and it gets boring quickly.  There is a ""Health Inspector"" card which is basically a ""you lose"" card and the 2 games my family played was won by the 1 person who did not get the Health Inspector card.  Spend your money on somethng else.  The Sushi Go game is a little more complicated but more fun.

  In this house we have a 10 year old, 26 year old, and two 50 year old members.  We all enjoy this game.  It reminds me a little of UNO, but the object before you go out of cards is to fill your taco/burrito with point cards.  We had to watch a youtube video on how to play, because the written instructions were slightly confusing on how the game ended.  The first time we played we turned over the discard pile and kept going, but as far as we can tell that is incorrect.  Once the draw pile is gone, the play continues until someone is out of cards from their hand.  Most points collected wins.  Lots of fun with cards that let you rob from other players, the discard pile, and change hands at the last minute with someone who was winning.  Hope this helps.

  My older sons (ages 11 and 9) LOVE this game and bug me to play it with them all the time.  My nearly 45 year old husband loves it just as much.  Yes, some of the food items are a little odd/gross, like human brains and blood salsa, but most of them are appropriately-gross foods, like warm yogurt, or items you would not want in your food, like hair and lice (and some are normal, like gummy bears).  I don't love it as much as the boys, but I didn't expect to.  They all think it's hilarious and I do think it allows for some good strategic thinking and competition.  It's the current ""thing"" in our house, and that's fine with me, given that it not video games or youtube. It's a creative, funny game that boys, especially, will love.

  It‚Äôs relatively simple but there are some important things left out in the instructions that left us unsure what to do. There really is no taco vs burrito since you can all be tacos really.

Good classic game of strategy
","

  Great game, much like the old game of Sorry, where each player's four pawns race around the board trying to get to Home base before their opponent does.  Parcheesi is a bit more challenging than Sorry.  In Parcheesi, a player can move pawns separately on each throw, based on the numbers that turn up on the two dice, as opposed to Sorry which uses a draw pile, revealing one card at a time to move one pawn around the board.  There is a stronger component of strategy in Parcheesi than Sorry (which is pretty much 90% chance, making it a better game for very young players).  There are added bonus moves in Parcheesi, as well, adding to the fun.  Sometimes I remember to take my bonus moves after capturing my husband's pieces and sometimes I don't, which is infuriating.  This is our new favorite game, and by the way, the pieces are well constructed and sturdy, not cheap or chintzy as a previous reviewer noted.  Good game, takes about 30-40 minutes to play with two people.

The only thing I don't care for is the size and shape of the dice. They are beveled to ""roll"" and they tend to roll too far, and they are very small and not so easy for these old eyes to see. Easily solved by purchasing regular sized dice at the dollar store. Great value for the money, it's a lot of fun to play these old games again!

  Easily the best board game I have ever played. May not catch the popularity of a game such as Monopoly but this game is complex enough to be fun for years to come while remaining easy enough to teach to new players. Great for all ages and one that I recommend for any family. There is a reason this became the royal game of India. Check it out and I promise you will not be dissappointed.

  I like how each home-base has a color assigned to it and then shows the color where you are to start from as well.  I like the plastic coating on the board too.  What I don't really like is that the pieces are very light and they slip and fall over way too easy.  The dice don't fit well in the cups and keep getting stuck inside making it difficult to get them out with the end result the only way to play the game is to toss the dice from your hand.

Great game but a few issues with this edition
","

  I'm writing a review of this edition of Taboo, not the game in general, which is great!There are a few issues with this edition of Taboo, which likely have been covered thoroughly in other reviews, so I'll just go over them briefly.- The squeaker: it doesn't have the same impact of the traditional buzzer and isn't as fun to use. Also, dogs will seriously think it's a toy for them as it sounds exactly like a dog squeaky toy.- No card holder: In a game in which you flip through cards under a time limit, it was nice to have the old holder so you can easily flip through cards. Now you just hold a loose stack of cards and place the used ones on the table or floor - just a bit messy and disorganized. I tried getting a holder from one of the old games, but these cards are a tiny bit too big to fit, so it doesn't work.- Text size: Compared to the old cards (see picture for comparison), these ones have smaller text, and a different word on top and bottom of each side of the card (so total of 4 words). This makes the text of the ""taboo"" words just a bit on the small side, so if you're watching to make sure your opponent isn't saying the words, you may have to lean in a little to read them. Of course there are twice as many words for a given amount of cards, but I liked the simplicity of having one word per card side.Great, fun game to play with friends but I would look for an older edition for a better playing experience. You might just have to explain a few words like Y2K to some of your younger friends.

An all-time favorite, even with 2 or 3 players
","

  Taboo has been one of my all-time favorite games.- It's a super simple game to understand.- It's hilarious to see how people act under pressure. I've been in tears laughing while playing this game. People can say the funniest things, especially since the game is designed in a way that makes you speak in strange ways since you're permitted from use certain words.- It's a great party game, as it requires little explanation, and you can easily pick it up and put it down whenever you're tired of playing.- You don't always need to keep score. Taboo is a game that's fun to just play without worrying about score.- Great for families, kids, or friends.PLAYING WITH 2 OR 3 PLAYERS:While Taboo is technically for 4+ players, I've had a lot of fun playing it with 2 and 3 players. With 3 players, you each take turns giving clues while the other two players guess. The person who guesses correctly gets 1 point, and the clue giver also gets one point, so everyone is incentivized to guess correctly. 2 players isn't as fun, since one player can easily prevent the other from scoring, but if you're less worried about score, this game can still be a lot of fun with just 2 people. One person guesses while the other gives clues. The clue giver is the only one who can score, so each player must make an honest effort when guessing.

  After 35+ years of playing games of various sorts, this still remains one of our family favorites! Well thought out and loads of fun to play! One of my favorite memories of teen years was playing this with a neighbor's family. They were at our house, and the dad was an attorney. He and my dad teamed up, and each of them literally said ONE WORD to the other one, and the other one would guess the correct word!! I wish I had video taped it, as it was a classic episode of game playing - they were totally in sync and it showed how fabulous this game can be and how fast paced it can move! It was always lots of fun to watch the women play too, because women have the gift of gab so could usually come up with clues for long enough to get a correct answer from even the slowest of brains!

  This is our family's favorite game - kids and grandparents included.  We have an 11 year old so we don't play by all the rules (we don't use the dice) but use everything else including the timer. He loves this game and most of all has improved immensely in the past year that we are now going to try playing with all the rules.  The game requires at least 2 teams of two players.  One player will be given a card and will have to explain the word 'Horse' for example to their teammate without using a list of Taboo words such as animal, mane, hay etc.  No actions or noises allowed.  It forces you to get creative with your words and explanations.  Highly recommend!

  Always fun to play. Has been a hit with different groups of people, including most recently (somewhat to my surprise) my mom and sister who love Scrabble but have never liked any of the popular party board games. I almost took off a star because this latest version of the game seems significantly easier than older editions - our teams of two people almost always figured out the mystery word, whereas in the past a lot of words went unguessed. Despite this, everyone had a good time and wanted to play again which IMO is what counts most.

  Why I chose this game:-I bought this game because I had played it a few times and was VERY good at it. I wanted something I could challenge my friends to, and then blow them out of the water.-I also bought this game to play with my father when he visits. We don't have a lot in common, so it's often difficult to find things for us to do together for ""quality time"". Board games are usually a universal way to bring people together.PROS:-You'll definitely get some laughs with this game.-It's easy to play, and those who have never played can learn the game rules and be playing in probably under 3 minutes.-It's a game I would play with my parent, so that should tell you that it's not too risque of a game despite its name.CONS:-I did notice the timer thing is a bit funny, like other reviewers have said. I didn't mind this though, as I like to use the timer on my phone anyway as it is easier to control.Ultimately, I would recommend this game to any of my friends with glowing reviews.

Used it as an expansion
","

  We play Taboo so much that we started to repeat the same cards over and over. We basically bought this edition just to use it as an expansion to the 2010 edition with the battery operated ""uhoh"" buzzer. The cards fit in/on the holder, and for that reason I'm pleased with it. If I bought this as a standalone game, I'd be a little disappointed because:1. The squeaker is a dog toy. Let's not pretend.2. There is no holder like previous editions.This edition is worth it as an expansion though. I might even buy the Midnight edition in the future for the same reason.

Great addition to game night!

  I bought this as an addition to our monthly game night. It brings out the competitive side to everyone. The clicker is a little different from other versions of taboo. My older game has a button for the beep, whereas this one comes with a rubber noise maker you squeeze. Still does the trick but maybe that could be a turn off to some. It comes with plenty of cards with words on both sides and a choice of 4 different lists. The die is something to mention as it's different from normal taboo. There's I believe 8 different sides to the die and each side of the die means a different thing.  From play the normal way to each team can participate. It's a good game to test your brain power and fast thinking skills. It's also kid friendly which is a plus.

Cheap product
","

  I have been playing Taboo for years and boy was I very disappointed when I opened this game.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is still fun to play.  I have owned several versions of the game and here are the differences.  In this version the cards are paper thin, where other versions, the cards were laminated.  I will say you get more clues because four come on a card.  There is no holder for the cards so it is hard to keep turn the cards and pass the cards from player to player especially if you are playing with a large group.  It gets messy.  The buzzer is a rubber squeak toy.  I had to substitute with spoons and bowls because it was driving my dog crazy because he thought it was his toy.  I am keeping the game because I have an older version where I can use the holder and the buzzer.  Otherwise it is cheap.  I would have been willing to pay the extra money to have a better made game.

  My daughter wanted this for Christmas. I've played the game before, but we have never owned it. I was telling her about the buzzer feature and was surprised to learn that there is no buzzer. Instead, there is a plastic vinyl squeezable squeaker instead. We were playing it at a friend's house and their dog was very interested in the squeezer. It's very similar to a dog squeeze toy. So we had to be careful with it and put it away when not in use. The game play was pretty much how I remembered it. It's a fun game for groups.

Hence, my 4th time buying this.It's perfect for all demographics, friends, family, or strangers events. It makes a great gift.The game is very easy to play; you just gotta be a quick thinker and a million dollar vocab helps, too.Each card is has a set of words (taboo words) and the word to be guessed at the top.  The person whose turn it is must describe the word to his or her teammate without saying the taboo words.

Where's the Buzzer?!?!
","

  Who doesn't like taboo? It's a fun party game, BUT sometime between the first few I bought for myself and gifts, they changed a classic feature. Now, instead of the electronic buzzer, Hasbro replaced it with what is essentially a handheld whoopy cushion. It's lame. The BUZZER kind of made the game. The new handheld squeaker thing feels cheap and everyone who had played before longed for the days with the buzzer. If you're thinking of buying this game, I highly recommend finding an older version with the buzzer. You'll be glad you did. I promise it makes a difference.

The old version is better!
","

  I LOVE Taboo- who doesn't!? I was very excited to open this brand new set with a group of friends recently. However, opening this version of the game was such a letdown! It's designed for ants! Here are the top three reasons this version stinks:1. There are no card holders. What the heck! You either have to hold the cards in your hand as you flip them, or use what I think is a makeshift card holder built into the box. The cardholder is a central piece of the game. HOW in the world could they have eliminated this?!2. The cards are tiny (therefore, font is tiny) and are about as thin as copy paper. They feel cheap and unimportant in your hand. Nothing like real playing cards!3. The ""buzzer"" is pathetic. It is not even a buzzer, it is basically a plastic dog toy and the sound it makes is a shy, airy squeak.

Game arrived in good condition with all parts

  Game arrived in good condition with all parts. My only qualm is that the original buzzer has been replaced by a squeaker and I have a dog that has been trained to viciously rip these out of toys she gets on the regular. I opened the game with excitement, testing everything out. While fiddling with the squeaker (it is not easy to squeek) I finally managed to create noise and to my horror, my dog dropped the ball she was actively playing with, with my father-in-law and directed all attention to the Taboo squeaker. I spent 5 minutes explaining to the dog that the squeaker was mine but already in play mode, my dog did not want to hear it and incessantly stared into my soul for the one thing in the world she knew was for sure hers from the damn noise. I put the game back in the box and she sniffed and stared for another 5 minutes before moving on with her life.I will likely give her the squeaker next time the box is opened as I am not strong of will. We will be forced to verbally abused those who mess up to ensure they know they have made a mistake.If you have a dog, I would recommend a different version of the game or practice making buzzer noises. There's probably an app for that.

Excellent game, too much packaging
","

  We love this game and think it's the perfect night-cap when we have family and friends over. Here are my findings:1. I got this game for a family game night on vacation. Our vacation was on a sailboat for a week, so we had to be careful with our packing--the boat only had limited storage space--as did our luggage. So, I took all of the items out of this box and they fit into a small Ziploc bag...way too much packaging!2. This particular game comes with a squeeze buzzer, rather than the battery-powered buzzer that the older version comes with. That means that we have to put my dog in the garage when we play because he gets to excited about the squeeze noise.3. The box comes with a pad to keep score for only two teams per sheet. We played with three teams, so we had to modify the pad. It's a tiny pad, so it was a little difficult to see our tiny little hashes when it was time to tally the score. Also, there was no pencil with the box, so we had to look through bags on the boat to find one.I love this game and would buy it over and over.

  I always like games promote communication. Taboo is one of many. Avalon is a better one !!!I am a light to medium strategy gamer, so I rarely touch the ""Mass Market Board Games"" but I have a weak spot for Taboo and Password because I consider myself is a awesome clue giver ~ ~ ~Components:- Very high quality squeaker, people here are complaining about they switch from the electronic buzzer to a squeaker, come on, simple is better, and no batter is needed.- Sand timer is good and the die is heavy for its size and very good quality.- I like it how they are 4 words per card now, so you get 162 cards in the game which means you are getting 648 words per game. This increase the replayability of the game ~Game play:- House rule. I bought this game with the intention to play with international students, and regular Taboo is already hard for most native English speakers, therefore to house rule it, you can play it backward, all you can say is the 5 words listed below the word you are trying to get people to guess. Try it and see what happened ~Full Disclosure:- One other thing makes me like this game is I bought it for $6.99 + tax here on Amazon with FREE Shipping !!! What a Deal ~

Good but the Original is Better.

  The original game is much easier and more fun to play so if you do not have that, I recommend buying that one instead. This is a decent game for anyone who has never played before or who has played the original version so many times that they need a refresh version. This game has a squeaker instead of a buzzer as in the original. It also does not have a card holder, which made game play more erratic as it puts pressure on the ""caller"" to make sure they don't set it down so everyone can see, or wave it around- or a many variety of other accidental mistakes we kept running into.

It gets a little difficult because some words you are not allowed to use, which are the obvious clues to the answer. The person next to you holds a buzzer and buzzes when you use one of the clues on the do not use list. When you get buzzed, you lost that round and the point goes to the opposing team. It can get rowdy and it really liven up the party. My kids as young as eight were able to play it although some they wouldn't be able to answer. Adults in their 60s were playing it as well. Great game.

  The game arrived quickly.  I bought another because my original game was loaned out and bot returned.  They just don't make games like the used to.  The buzzer has been replaced by a squeaky toy.  This is annoying because it causes my dogs to become excited and bark!  I guess the manufacturer cut cost by eliminating the buzzer?? Other than this issue the game is great!

Boring Cards
","

  This version is a serious downgrade from the original game. I love Taboo and had a lot of fun playing it. My dislike of this game is mainly because the cards are very simple. This is supposed to be updated and modernized, but there are more cards that say basic things like Zebra, Spy, Tickle, Brown, or Jedi. The older version of the game has more creative cards with celebrity names, movie titles, places, etc. You can easily download (free) better versions of this game on your phones app store.If you mainly play this with children or tweens, this might not be a bad choice. If you are more of a Cards Against Humanity player... don't purchase this game.

  This game was super easy to learn and makes family game nights enjoyable! Super fun to see what you'll have to describe without saying the words listed on the card! Definitely not a game you can play in the car since there are so many cards and you‚Äôll need to be able to see and hear your partner(s) well to be able to guess. It also gets loud so it might make the car ride stressful for the driver! But be my guest and prove me wrong and that you can play while traveling

  decide to resume with this one, and it was a great choice: this game has the right amount of strategy playing with balanced complexity... which is actually very simple to learn. I wanted a game for casual players, as having guests at home that do not play it often, so must be simple enough to learn its dynamic in the first 30 minutes instead of multiple game sessions, and it is what I looked for. Expensive I would say, but still a great choice. Also very clear instructions.

Newer version is cheaper than original

  My parents had Taboo when I was growing up, and we used to love to play it (especially in large groups). I recently got married and purchased this for our own game collection. I was a little disappointed at the new game style. Instead of a buzzer, there is now an annoying little squeaker. There is no card holder like in the older version, so there is no easy way of keeping the cards together while you play. I looked into returning this and purchasing an older version; however, the older version is much more expensive, since it is considered vintage now. We decided just to keep this one. I don't like it as much as the original version, but it works as described.

  This game is fun for all ages, and can be played with as many people as you want. The box says 4+, but I played with 3 people and as long as you're just playing for fun and not super competitive that works fine. With more people, you want someone on the same team as you giving you the clues, not someone on the opposite team.We got creative and played it a bit like charades too - one person would give clues, and the first person to guess the word got the point for it.The squeaker thingy was a nice addition. The judge squeaks it when time runs out, or when someone says a ""taboo"" word, and it's hilarious.

  Bought this for a gift for my sister who loves this game. We had an old version and wanted one with updated cards.

For ""popcorn"" the forbidden words would probably be something like ""movies"" and ""butter""It's fun to play with people you're close to because the dialog winds up being like ""we ate this yesterday while we watched Star Wars"" or ""you don't like this because it gets stuck in your teeth""But it can also easily be played with people you aren't terribly close with.

Where's the buzzer?...it is half the fun!

  Well I guess I didn't read the description closely, but I was expecting the traditional Taboo game with the card holder and an actual buzzer. Instead you are provided a ""squeaker"" to squeak a taboo word. Picture a small dog toy and that is what the ""squeaker"" is. How disappointing! You want to buzz the person not shake a dog toy at them. The card holder would have been nice but we didn't mind just holding a stack in our hands. Hasbro usually makes better designed games. They went too cheap with this version of a classic game.

  I think this is a great game for people who barely play board games as well as those who play a LOT of board games. It's always one of my go-to's for family/friend gatherings and everybody has a good time. Obviously those who are more serious board game players will prefer more strategic and complicated games, but I still think anybody who collects board games in general should have this in their stash.This version comes with the non-battery powered buzzer which was odd at first, but really made more sense to me after awhile. I'm sure a lot of people will miss the old loud and super-annoying buzzer (it's fun to scare people with it while they're concentrating), but at least with the newer one you don't have to worry about replacing batteries ever and just start playing. It sounds a lot like a dog toy but it gets the job done.

  I loved this game growing up and it is exactly how I remember it from the 90's. It is similar to Trouble or Sorry with a little more strategy and a lot more laughing. My 6 year old son had the rules down after a couple of games playing together. We have tons of board games and I'm pretty sure this is his favorite now. He laughs so much when we play. My husband (32yrs) who doesn't always get into board games saw us playing this one afternoon and said, ""I get to play the next game!"" Now he always wants to play with us, and he's usually the one insisting on ""one more game"" even though it's past bedtime. The marbles stay in the holes as long as you're not too rough and are careful where you roll the die. I would definitely say it's funnest to play with 3 people...6 players turns into a lot of waiting for your turn.

Slightly different than classic aggrevation, but still good!
","

  I grew up playing Aggravation at my grandma's house. We had the 1982 version I believe.  This version has slightly different set up, mainly in how you get out of base (and where base is located) and how you go into home.  On the version I played as a kid we had base off to the side of the play board, on this version it is directly below home (easy for marble to run away from you in my opinion).  We started on the bottom left corner of the track loop, this version you start on the spot below home.  On the old version you had to go through the current version's start spot to get into home.  The current version also doesn't include the rules about rolling sixes.  We always played that if you rolled a six you got out of base and immediately onto the 'fast track' (star track) because you broke the six down into 1-onto the start spot and 5-the number of steps to the fast track.  This doesn't work with the new board design.  The new rules also don't state the rule about getting to roll again when you roll a six.As far as the board itself goes, the marbles are lighter as other reviewers have mentioned.  Also the marbles and die (also light) come in a plastic bag.  The old version was a bi-fold board and had little chutes for each color of marble so you didn't need to dig through a bag.Ultimately we ended up playing with the old rules (I might paint start circles on my board to keep people from being confused).  It's great to have a copy that my family can now play when they come to my house.

Simple, fun board game!
","

  This is about as basic a board game as it gets, but it does provide a good amount of fun for the family, and it can be played by up to 6 people, which is also nice!  I never played Aggravation as a kid, but my wife and I played this with our kids for the first time the other night and we all had a good time.  The premise of the game is pretty simple...get your marbles from your base all the way around the board and back to your home.  First to get all four marbles back home wins!The Aggravation name comes from the rule that some moves can only be done on exact rolls (exiting the base, entering the home, exiting the center of the board, etc.) and also that direct count landing on another player send them all the way back to the start!  The inclusion of the shortcuts in the middle of the board help to ease the ""Aggravation"" quite a bit, which is probably helpful in preventing people from filpping over the board in a rage after playing for over an hour with no winner.My only complaint about this particular game is that the setup of the marbles and the game board isn't conducive to playing on a hard surface.  Since the board is thin, the marbles are essentially sitting on the table even when in the slots on the game board.  This means bumping the board or nudging another players marble when moving your own can have marbles coming loose pretty easily.  A slightly different design could've eliminate this annoyance.Other than my one gripe, this is a pretty great, simple, and fun game for the whole family!

Better than Sorry!

  I hadn't played Aggravation before, but when our family got sick of Monopoly, Parcheesi, Sorry, and Life, we went for it.  It is very much like Sorry except with a few twists that make it more interesting.  The stars in the center of the board let you migrate around faster, and there is more chance for ""bopping"" as my kids call it.  You are more likely to get sent back to your base.  Also, six people can play, which makes for a more interesting/scary journey around the board (if you have six people).  My only complaint was that the game can take forever to finish, so we had to make up a few of our own family rules to get it over quicker.  Also, it can cause more tears if your players are more sensitive to getting sent home.  Oh, and the gameboard is pretty small.  We were kind of hovering over a footstool--don't know why they couldn't have made it more Monopoly sized.  Otherwise, worth adding to your stash, especially if you like Sorry but feel like you're 6 years old when you play it.

  I grew up playing the original Aggravation with my grandmother. I wanted to teach my boys this game, and my husband surprised us with this game for Christmas. This game is pretty easy to teach to kids - one time through and my 4 and 5 year old understood how the star and special middle shortcuts work and everything. Great game like Trouble or Sorry with a little extra element of the unique shortcut. The board is a little smaller than the original brown one (probably 1960-1970 version), but it's still a good size. As other reviewers mention, it does differ from the original game a little. The colors of peices are brighter (which we liked) and the marbles aren't real marbles, they're made out of plastic. When I read this prior to adding it to my wish list I was a little disappointed to read that, but after playing it myself, the ""marbles"" do have some weight to them and don't feel super plastic. I'll admit I had to hit it against the coffee table to tell for sure if it was plastic or marble. Very pleased with our new family game, especially for the nostalgia of playing my grandma's favorite game.

  The box and the game board are good quality as far as thickness and durability. However, my game board is slightly defective, with the holes drilled off center in some of the ""home"" lines.

  Kind of like Sorry, yet different.  I can see why it's called ""Aggravation"" though.  Not just in game play, but in the game itself.  The dice are pretty small, which I'm not thrilled about.  The pieces themselves that you move around the board are marbles.  Yes, this makes it different than Sorry, but also makes it a bit of a pain.  The holes in the board for them as you move around are larger in diameter, allowing the marble to move more than you'd like.  And don't jar the board, or the marbles may all come loose.

Find the original board- they changed this and not able to play with this new design
","

  Not like the original Aggravation board, this folds into 4 and cuts off the holes for the marbles (which aren‚Äôt real marbles in this newly made one,they are light plastic which makes them roll away so easily. They changed the quality of the board and not able to play the game with this newly made board. Disappointed in new design. Bring back the original one with real marbles and just folded in half once.

Great Family Fun!

  Since the VIRUS, we have been playing games with my mother every night to keep some laughter going throughout the house. This aggravation has been the key. It says to use one dice but we decided it was too slow paced and so we now use 2 dice and it always is a very close game, ALWAYS! So weird how something like that changes it up. I would highly recommend this game!

  Nice game, very cheap made for the cost. I read the reviews from other people and I couldn't find one like mine. My board came ripped on one side I don't know if is normal for easier folding or a big defect since all the folding points are paper thin and eventually will rip apart too. Also very uneven when completely unfolded on a flat surface.

  This is a fun game!!! They only thing I wish is that the balls they use were marbles like the original game was made.  The balls are so light and like to pop out of the game board when anyone taps the board or rolls a dice accidentally on it. It‚Äôs kind of annoying. That doesn‚Äôt happen with the weight of a marble very easily. I‚Äôve looked into buying my own actual marbles for the game but I would have to buy in bulk and I don‚Äôt need that many marbles.

  We bought the ""Retro"" version at Target and it is light years better than this one. This model is cheap. Marbles are plastic and weak, game board is thinner, and some of the holes are ""off"". The Retro game came with 6 dice, one for each player, and this version came with one larger dice. The Retro version came with 4 marbles in each color and this version came with 5 which was the only nice thing about this game. Overall we are extremely disappointed with the quality of this game. It served its purpose and we still enjoyed playing it. If you have to choose between this and the slightly more expensive Target Retro version- go with the Target version!

  ...the marbles are plastic (I knew this before purchasing) but are very light weight.  I will replace with REAL marbles.

  We have had an Aggravation game for years that we played with the kids and now play with the grand kids.  Our granddaughter loves to play.  Since they live far away we decided to buy her one to play at her own home with her family.  She was thrilled.  The only difference is that my older set uses real marbles and the newer set uses light weight plastic balls that don't stay in place as easily as the marbles.

  Whoever invented this game is clearly into sports, especially at a college level. This is not something our family cares about in the least, but I purchased the game on sale, so with some handy Avery Brand labels, I created some questions that were suited to our family interests and would make this game more fun for our group. I'd say if you can purchase the game at a deep discount and have the means to alter the cards for some broader questions, it's well worth your time and great for some laughs, too. I dropped a star for the sports/universities overload, but if that's your thing....add the star back as this would be right up your alley.

  Wow! I am so happy I brought this game up to our Cousins Reunion! The game was a great ice breaker with all the Cousins! There were many that I never met or did not really know well! ! It was a hit with all the adults and kids! (Family friendly version) The game is very easy to play (especially when the adults had one too many to drink (not the kids!))We made up our own rules:Basically, one person is the judge per round. The judge picks a card from the box of cards and reads it aloud! The person to the judges left is in the hot seat and has to give three answers under five seconds. The game comes with a five second timer that gets turned over immediately after the judge reads the card. The person on his left must answer within the allotted time. If not, the card is returned to the back of the box of cards! However, if the person gives three answers, the timer is turned over again for the next person to give three different answers from the first person. This continues until someone makes a mistakes or has a brain fart and is stomped! When that happens, the card is given to the LAST person who gave the last three different answers from anyone else. The game continues until someone accumulated six cards ! We could not stop laughing!I highly recommend this game if you want to have lots of fun!

  My 10-year-old loves to play this game with me and my wife, and it's surprisingly challenging to come up with 3 of anything in 5 seconds.  And even though this game is pretty difficult for his 5-year-old sister, my son started coming up with categories of his own on her level.  The card might say ""name 3 pro soccer players"" Or ""name 3 sci-fi movies"", but my son decided to put the card down and make up one for his little sister.  He said, ""name 3 Dora the Explorer characters.""  The intense focus on her face and she scrambled to name 3 characters from one of her favorite shows in only 5 seconds... oh, it was just fantastic.  And reading the cards themselves as I play with my 10-year-old is fun too.  Sometimes he comes up with things I figure he'll never be able to think of.  It's a fun little game that encourages family time.  I love it.

The rules of the game are pretty straightforward. We had kids as young as 9 to adults as old as 60 years old playing. The only con is that we went through the cards pretty quickly because of the number of people playing. I looked on Amazon and there aren't additional ""play card packs"" you can purchase to add to the cards that come with the game. Maybe I didn't look well enough but that would be the only negative thing I have to say about this game.

good sit-around-in-a-group game
","

  Fun while you have a small crowd sitting around, easy to start and stop, easy for mixed crowds where conversation might struggle. This is a great way to just kick off a party or fill in time during a reunion. We enjoyed it - it's not something we play often, so not a favorite. It really is well-suited for the types of situations I mentioned above, and does a great job helping us all have a good time!

Perfect for everyone and anyone!

  This game is perfect for anyone! It‚Äôs easy to play, perfect for any age. It‚Äôs easy as pie to understand. The game can be as appropriate or naughty as you make it. With the adults, we tend to make it more adult-content but you can adjust it to the ages. It doesn‚Äôt require players so people can come and go which is perfect for larger families or several players. Personally, I think the 5 seconds is a bit too easy but all in all it‚Äôs a fun game and certain questions really can mess with your brain due to the time!

  This game is super fun, but it‚Äôs better with a group that is lexiconic (is that a word). This is a great mind challenge. We play with all ages and bend the rules for either end of the spectrum. If you get to giggling on someone‚Äôs answer, it can totally make it impossible to answer the newer set. A lot of fun. I suggest adult beverages and a happy group of six for the most fun.

  We played this at a family party, ages 13 to 70+. Questions ranged from hard (name 3 flags that have green in them) to easy (name 3 yellow foods).

  Game night is a very cool event for my family but this game is not one of our favorites. It is very limiting and the time is definitely fast. We recently had game not for the Xmas holiday.

There were other games that family and friends were excited to play again. No one even mentioned this game.

  Obviously one can play competitively. However this was a good game for us to enjoy time with each other as a family.The whole game is simple: each card has two sides and asks that you name three nouns that fit the description. You can adjust the play level for children and adults by picking the more difficult question for adults and the easier one for children.

No one wanted to go home. Senior adults, adults in their 40s, teens and grade schoolers, everyone had a blast. So I bought this one to give as a gift.

Not at all as pleasant to play as when my daughter was young.  It used to be a favorite game for young ones, and I wanted to share that with my nieces.  The redesign is a disaster compared to the way it used to be when the chutes and ladders were smaller.  I regret the purchase.

  My 3yo calls this game Sh*** and Ladders, haha! It requires a little more attention span than she has right now, but she loves it for a good 10 minutes before she starts playing make believe with the pieces.  We think she'll be able to sit through a game better when she turns four. But i like the board and pieces! Very cute. I like being able to talk about how doing good things can boost up our lives and self esteem and others, but how misbehaving can drag us down

Closer to 4 and up
","

  My son just turned three and I have tried about three times to engage him in this game (aswell as one other one rated for the same age range). It is very difficult for him to understand, much less remain engaged in this game for any amount of time at all. I suggest you don't even try this with your kid until they are four, or else you will be protecting it and pulling it back out for a few seconds at a time over and over again in hopes of building the kid up to withstand sitting to play 1/4 of as long as is required for a round of this game. He just tries for a few minutes and then is onto a more immediately rewarding form of play.

Great game for my 3.5 year old, but quality of construction not what games used to be!
","

  I bought this game for my 3.5 year old son and think it's a great game for his age.  Because it was the first time I've played this game myself, I cannot compare it to any older versions of the board game.  However, I found this game to be a great choice for my son for the following reasons:(1) Simple enough for my 3.5 year old to comprehend after just a brief explanation and our first game.  The objective of the game is to be the first to reach square #100, using a spinner numbered 1 through 6, which advances you on the board.  He is learning his numbers, so seeing each square numbered from 1-100 allows us to count together and learn our numbers while each one of us advances on the board.(2) A fun way to learn that there are consequences for our actions.  Some of the squares are ""rest"" spaces, which means that you land on the square and no additional action is taken. Other spaces have chutes (or slides), which sends your player down to a lower numbered square on the board; the children depicted on these squares are behaving badly (eating too many cookies, pulling a cat's tail, etc.) and are sent down the slide as a consequence of their bad behavior.  There are also ladder squares, which depict children behaving well and reward them by allowing the player to climb the ladder and automatically advance several squares on the board. My child finds this part of the game quite entertaining.(3) It's a game of chance, so my child never feels badly if he's not the winner of the game.  We take turns taking the lead on the board throughout each game and, because the spinner dictates which square we land on, he doesn't blame himself if he doesn't turn out the winner every time. This is also a good lesson for him to learn!The NEGATIVES - Games just aren't made the way they used to be. The spinner included with this game needs to be assembled and is cheaply made. I have to hold down the base each time my son or I spin the arrow.  Also, the character ""players"" are constructed of cardboard and slide into a plastic stand.  The characters are too large to fit in the box when assembled, so you have to assemble and disassemble the characters with each game. Note: The first time I assembled the characters, the cardboard face on one of the characters peeled back and I had to tape it to keep it together.  With that said, I'm assuming that they are not going to hold up well with time.

Okay for family game night
","

  I really love playing this game, however there are a few things that could use improvement. As an adult, I feel it is somewhat easy to see where the chutes and ladders begin and end. But for a small child around 4 years old it can be a little difficult to see what you need to be doing. I had a little trouble but was able to really look at the board and figure it out. However my daughter struggled and was getting a little frustrated. The spinner worked great which I was surprised about because it honestly felt cheap but it worked just fine. Still a fun game to play but if the game could have a better start and end to the chutes and ladders it would make it a lot more enjoyable. Would recommend for family game night but expect little ones to need a little expexted guidance.

  It is an nice game for my toddler boys, although it came damaged and I missed the date for returns ( my fault) . I would like for it to come with dies as well.

5 Stars for Chutes and Ladders!
","

  This is the newer version of the old time Chutes and Ladders board game which is so essential for our little ones to play. I bought it for our 4 year old grand daughter and she must have played the game with family members 15 times the first day which was her birthday!  She loved it and the skills it teaches are most important. I was a 1st grade teacher for a number of years plus we raised three kids on old fashioned board games, not the electronic games of today.  I would encourage all of the young parents now to make sure that they are buying and playing the old board games with their children. I also bought Candyland which she loved, also!

Good game
","

  If played to encourage number line recognition, where the kid starts at the number block they are on and counts up from there, given the number of spaces they spin (i.e. playing piece on block 26, spin 4, count 27, 28, 29, 30) it is fantastic for teaching the number line concept to kids too young for the 'official' lesson...  however, doing so makes it a game for 6 year olds +. If keeping it simply as a game, ignoring the numbers on the blocks, the younger kids love it but don't gain the added benefit.  Still, they enjoy playing it.

Fun, but board could be a little less busy & pieces less cheap
","

  I am not sure if there are different versions of this game, but my daughter got this for a gift, and while it is fun to play, it can be confusing at times. The board needs to have less pictures on, and more arrows pointing to which direction you are going. For little ones who like to play this, it is sometimes easy to forget which direction you are going and end up going the wrong way! (lol! I have done it myself).  The board seems a bit too ""busy"", and the numbers are very small, with only a small arrow at the beginning of each line.  The only other negative I have is that the game pieces are a cheap cardboard that must be put together before each play (otherwise if you don't take them apart they won't fit into the box ).  This means that the cardboard will eventually become frayed at the bottom where you stick the pieces into the plastic bases.  They really should be one solid plastic piece. So I give the game designers 0 stars, and the 3 stars are for game concept and overall fun factor.

  To begin the packaging/shipping was perfect.  There was no damage and was deliver on time.  The game itself as you can see from the picture is not like the original.  This to me was no big deal at first until we started playing the game with our 3 year old daughter.  The board is riddled with confusion constantly guessing which direction you need to be going do to the lack of indication.  The player pieces are extremely large thus causing trouble for players to share a space.  If 3 land on the same spot, forget it just put the others in the middle of the board or suffer frustration.  The spinner works well enough to get the job done and there really isn't much more to say about this product other than make every effort to find the older version or at least a different one from this.  :D Hope this helped!

  A good classic for learning up, down, counting, and board game etiquette. There are also several pictures demonstrating good vs. bad behaviors, not all of which are simple enough to explain to a 3 year old. The pieces of the game are of sturdy cardboard but not indestructable to a toddler. The graphics are very colorful but very busy, and personally, I do not like children's heads in the shape of footballs. Don't forget to hold down the spinner or it will whip out of place and knock all the pieces down.  Lastly if you're an adult playing with your child, be prepared to play for a marathon 15 minutes (unlike most preschool toys that are finished in 5 minutes) because of those troublesome chutes.

  Connect Four is a winner for the very young, the little bit older, and the lot older (yes, the grownups).  The really small ones have fun dropping the colored discs into patterns and then releasing them from the bottom.  Fun.  A little older kids will be getting the idea of putting four discs in a row while picking up a bit of basic math.  Some fun and some learning at that age. The grownups should enjoy the game as they attempt to connect four in a row before their opponent does so. Setup is pretty quick. Slip on the two legs and the game is set to go.

  Connect Four is a family fun game from my childhood. This game is built with a bit better construction than the game of my youth although played just the same. My 6 yr old twins and 10 yr old grandkids all enjoy competing in this game for bragging rights of who is the most clever for the day.It stores easily in its game box and is set up quickly for play. Connect Four has been a staple in my game closet for 30 plus years. I purchased this to replace my love-worn game from the early 80‚Äôs. I hope this review is helpful in convincing you that this is 10$ well spent for decades of family fun. It‚Äôs a two-player game, but we play it tournament style so all can play when more than 2 want to compete. If you don‚Äôt lose the checkers... you‚Äôll love this game still in 2050!

My 3 yo likes to mess about with it, even if he doesn't really get the concept. My 5 year old loves it. I had to hide the blue pieces though because I have no idea what they do.

  We still use the same connect 4 game from when my own kids were young, but had to buy a second one for the grandchildren to play with! They are only toddlers, but for now, they like to make different patterns with the colors then delight in sliding open the bottom to watch the pieces drop out. Excellent quality, easy to learn, and fun for all ages.

Great classic game!
","

  This is a wonderful classic game and I was so happy to find it on Amazon. The game board isn't the best quality plastic, but I didn't see any better quality options anywhere. The game was easy to set up, and it was easy to teach my child how to play. Great game if you want to help your child work on those critical thinking skills, plus its fun! Overall, great find, and glad this game is still on the market. Brings back many childhood memories.

Great tool for social skills and relationships.
","

  This game is one of my favorite tools to foster social skills in young children and strengthen child-adult relationships.Facing each other and in close proximity, the eye contact and alternating turns f this game encourage conversation and bonding. Both the child and the adult have something to focus on which makes them more relaxed and in turn helps them open up to each other. Classic

Game

  This Connect Four Game is exactly as you would expect. We had to put it together which took less than 30 seconds. It seems plenty sturdy and my 6 year old granddaughter loves playing the game. The bottom release worked very well to let the discs drop so we could begin a new game.  We easily fit everything back in the box once we were done.

  Connect4 is an old favorite in this house.  Such a great way to encourage middle schoolers to think beyond decisions ""right now"".  Helps them to consider, ""What if I...?""  But a great game and gets kids away from screens!Be careful with the stand.  The stands aren't super sturdy.  I fear the stand will break as our last one did.

  Played this with my mom tonight. I had watched a video of how to play beforehand, and I have played the video game so I had a pretty good idea of how it would go. Still, I thought it would be a lot harder to explain to my mom who hasn't had any experience with the game or area control games than it turned out to be. We had no problems figuring out how to play, the game loop is very fun, well written rules and the few problems we did have were easily found right away in the rules. The artwork is exactly what you would expect, functional and does the job just like the video game. High quality parts and some nice little details like the ""death"" dice has little red blood splatters on it. We both had so much fun and I can't wait to play it again with more people! I have a feeling this is going to end up as a top favorite for me on game nights. :) 10/10

  This is a really fun game unlike Pandemic the players play against each other. It's nice to work with everyone in curing a disease, but sometimes it's more fun to win by eliminating everyone else.

  This game is much, much more casual than most table top games me and my crew play. But oddly, we still very much enjoy it. This game is definitely geared toward families,  it very easy to understand and play. But I still recommend it for for serious groups, as there is many different play styles, options, and outcomes.

Good adaptation of Risk but not as good a game as Catan Jr
","

  Very good adaptation of Risk for little kids. My nephews (5 and 4) really enjoyed it and kept wanting to play again. The 4-year-old needed occassional reminding of the rules but was still engaged.It takes the nastiness out of the game of Risk, but still keeps the bare essence of the game - invasion and defending territory, all via luck of the roll. No one felt attacked or ganged-up on. Once all the islands are raided the game is over, so it is quick and light. No one gets eliminated.The board is made up of islands. You sail your boat around looting treasure. Great choice of theme!The boats are dice-flippers. While it's fun to use them to flip the dice, it was problematic doing it with your ships on the board. The kids kept moving their ships to flip the dice, then forgetting where there ships actually belonged. Cute idea but a little clumsy in practice.Highly recommended IF you like games like Monopoly Jr and/or if you like Risk and want to introduce your kids to it.If you want something with a little more depth and strategy, go with Catan Jr as it's also pirate-themed but has much richer gameplay. Risk Jr is good, Catan Jr is awesome!

Lazy game design that relies on the Risk name
","

  Here are my complaints:1. The only cool thing about this game is the ships that launch the dice, but even as an adult, trying to do that with your ship on the board is difficult. Kids aren't going to be able to do it without picking it up and losing their place. Not thought through very well.2. The game just doesn't work. The rules had to have been put together in 15 minutes. The rules don't explain what to do once there are no islands left for you to attack. Almost inevitably one person is left to just sit there through no fault of their own. The game doesn't explain what to do once you run out of pirates. Though it's completely pointless to really leave pirates anyways.3. This game isn't like Risk at all. I wanted it to be a simpler version of Risk so that when my kids get older, they'll understand the basics. The only similarity is you roll dice for combat. Monopoly Jr. is more like Risk than this game.4. Way too simple. My 4-year-old said ""that was easy,"" and the game is 5+. The first time we finished took 10 minutes, maybe. I kept re-reading the rules, thinking I missed something. Nope, the game designers were just lazy and relying on the Risk name to sell the game.

  My almost 6 year old likes it. Especially the launching dice. I wish each ship had its own colored dice.

  The Hasbro Gaming Risk Junior Game: Strategy Board Game - Pirate Theme arrived just in time!Disclosure:  I have never played Risk.  I don't know how this compares to the original game.  There really isn't any strategy involved.  It's just all luck really, but I feel like this helps to build some gaming basics for kids if you are board gamer parent like myself.  I don't really play commercial games, it's the nerdy made in Germany with insane rules and world building that I play.  I digress...In Risk Junior, everyone has a boat and 8 tokens.  You take turns to put your tokens on each island on the game board.  Then you take turns sailing from island to another in hopes of collecting buried treasure.  The way you collect the treasure is when you travel another that is your own, you ""battle"" its inhabitant, by ""flipping"" dice simultaneously.  Whoever has the most on his/her flip wins the treasure.  If there is a tie, the original inhabitant gets the treasure.  In your ship is a dice ""flipper.""  You put the die in the ship and launch it up in the to the air.  This mechanism I am guessing is to keep kids interested because you really could just roll it.  You have travel along the dotted lines, no hopping over islands.  Game play is fast, quick, and easy.  Set up is also quick and easy.  Personally, I like Ticket to Ride better and we're about to start learning Catan Junior, but I would say between Risk Junior and Monopoly Junior for little kids ages 4-6, this one is better.  Monopoly was too slow and never kept my son interested at that age.  Now at 7.5, he'll sit for it, but he's almost at Monopoly playing age.As a parent playing this with my only child, this is boring!  I would suggest other games junior like games because I my patience wore thin on this and this is coming from a person who plays games where each player has like 5 moves within one turn and there are 8 players!  Also, be careful when punching out the tokens.  The paper on the cardboard rips off easily.

  This game was super quick to explain to my kiddos that are 7, 5, and 2 years old.  Within about 5 minutes we had opened the box, set up the board, and read the instructions and got ready to play.  My kids had a great time!  It was simple to play and very engaging.  The little boats come with a built in little flinger that launches a ball, it was my kid's favorite part of the game!  The boats were perfectly engineered for little fingers.  All three kiddos were able to launch things from their boats without any issue at all.

The dice flipping is a pain
","

  This game has some design flaws. My 5 year old daughter liked it, but it's a pain and we're losing interest. The core gameplay involves moving a plastic boat to various islands connected by dotted lines, then putting in a dice, and tapping a lever which makes the dice flip. It's the value of the die that determines who wins the round. The problem is that the process of flipping a die always makes the boat move all around, even adults have trouble. Also, the design of the board means that sometimes if you play, you have a battle every move and the game is too fast; or you end up with spread and you have to do multiple moves, at which point you are bored, just to get across the board to do some final battles.

Best suited for kids ages 5-8 years old
","

  This Risk Junior game is easy to learn and keeps the 5 year old boy I got this for interested.  The game is basically rolling the dice and whoever gets the higher number keeps the treasure and then you add up the coins in each treasure in the end.  The ship tokens are cool because they have a lever to flip the dice as opposed to rolling the dice. The pirate theme is also pretty cute.  Everything is up to chance so there's really no strategy involved. Average gameplay is about 15 minutes or so. It's not the most exciting game to play as a family as it's the type of game that a child will grow out of as they get older.  I think it's probably best suited for kids under the age of 8 years old.

my kids find it fun
","

  Glad this ended up being a fun game for my kids. From preschool to my older teens, my kids enjoyed taking turns to hopefully claim an island or reclaim their island. It takes some strategizing and not just the roll of the dice to play it. There's a big element of competition too that my more competitive kids loved. What's nice about this game is that there's always a chance at redeeming your losses until all the treasures ran out. It's not until the end that all the secret-treasure points are revealed and counted. So, even if one person only gets an island or 2 by the end, there's still a chance at winning via the revealed treasure points.  The pirate ships with the push-button dice launcher was pretty fun for them too.Highly recommended.

No real strategy
","

  I like the idea of taking an adult game and making a kid version of it. This wasn't well done. Essentially you randomly claim islands and then sail around to other people's islands and roll dice for whatever is on them. This is the best part because you get to launch dice from your ships, which is cool. But then you get a random point token and see who has the most at the end. It's really all luck (especially in a two-player because you can only fight for pieces on someone else's island). It's nothing like Risk other than rolling dice and see who has more. The ships are cool but gimmicky. Overall, I'd probably pass on it.

  This is a great introduction to the classic game Risk for preschoolers and young elementary aged-kids. We have a 5-year-old and a 9-year-old. It is perfect for my 5-year-old. The game is a very simple strategy game where you visit different islands and dice battle another player for treasure. The treasure chips are excellent for teaching beginning counting. But, my kids favorite part of the game is the ship dice roller tool by far. They love putting the dice in the ship and pushing the lever that shoots and flips the dice. It does make the game more fun. Overall, great choice for little board gamers.

I want to love this game, but just cannot
","

  At one time this was my number one most excited board game that I ever wanted to own.Now, this is my number one disappointment for games I've ever bought.  It's collecting dust and sits on my shelf.  Don't think though it's not because we don't play it or don't try to play it, because we did.  I kept pulling it off the shelf at game nights only to hear my Group of 4-6 players usually moan and groan, but I persisted.  I told them it would be different this time, that we could try a different house rule or online play variation I had read about.  We could get energy faster so the cards actually become usable, and we would remove many of the cards that just had useless effects.With each play, each attempt at changing playstyles on my part to make it fun for others, each time we tried to make it better it  just worsened for us.There is little to no point in every collecting energy and buying cards, the game just doesn't last long enough for that.  One of two things will happen in ever game.  Everyone will roll entirely for claws and go last monster standing, and in games of 4-6 you hardly get a turn or two before people are dropping like flies just from die rolls.  Or instead of claws some or everyone rolls purely for victory points, which can make the game even more boring and someone can win even faster.I just found in the end it wasn't worth even pulling to the table anymore.  Which is sad because, I LOVE the theme, the standees, the power up cards, the funny characters and powers.  I love it all as its individual components, it just doesn't feel like there is a game left over in the end.  You would leave everything in the box and just roll the dice until someone reaches 20 points and play the same game.I want to like it, I want to love it again, I just don't think that will ever happen for me or our Group.  I wanted to save this game so much in my collection that I even added the Power Up Expansion hoping it would fix things.  Sadly it also did not help.Great looking game, nice components, pointless parts of the game play and plays faster than setup and breakdown of it.

  Great game. Quick to learn.  Playable for Non gamers.  For hardcore gamers it will get boring fast it you play several rounds in a row, but is an amazingly balanced good game in small doses.My game group uses it as a warm up or a night cap.  Or if we have a non gamer over!  A must own for the collection.Once players are familiar, games can take as little as ten glorious minutes of Smashing!

A quick fun game for the family, or a filler game while you wait for your last gamer friend to drive over/pick up food.
","

  This 2-6 player game is fairly quick and simple to play. You roll dice like you would in Yahtzee, and you try and either accumulate points or knock the other monsters out.There's strategy, so it's not all dice rolling, but I would say that luck plays a bigger factor than actual skill in this game. But it's not as lopsided in the luck department like in Yahtzee by any means.There are also some cards that you can buy to either help improve your monster, or to help harm other monsters.All in all, it's a fun family game that doesn't take up a lot of time, and even younger kids can enjoy. There is the unlikely scenario where a person gets knocked out very early in the game, and if it's a child, she/he might be angry or upset that she/he has to sit on the sidelines whilst she/he waits for the game to end.

Good. Could have been great. Modified rules make it more fun for 2.
","

  I write this review coming from a two player standpoint.Overall I like the idea. A battle of Kaiju over Tokyo. At the start, it's a dice rolling press-your-luck game. Glorified Yahtzee. But what makes this unique is the dynamic of not healing while in Tokyo, the ticking clock of staying in Tokyo, and the cards.What a shame, is that the game is over VERY quickly. And it seems like the cards and income accrual just aren't there before the clock runs out. I would much prefer it to last a little longer. Not using the cards are a shame because those are what makes the game more interesting!Modified rules can help and are likely needed. Such as getting two energy cube (currency) per die. Or double health (""die"" then resurrect with a penalty, like a Street Fighter game).I really do think it needs a second revision to address these issues.But this is coming from the perspective of only playing in two player. A 4,5,6 player game may be totally different.

Our New Favorite Game
","

  We love King of Tokyo. It‚Äôs easy to learn how to play, combining dice rolling (like Yahtzee) with monsters and power cards.  There are two ways to win, either get 20 Victory Points first or be the last monster standing (alive).This is one of our go-to games when friends are over (we enjoy playing games like Dominion, Survive, 7 Wonders, Pandemic, 6 Nimmt, Feast or Famine, etc).A game usually takes us around 30 minutes to play (even with 6 players, though we often play with 3).  We have so much fun, that most times we immediately play it again.We bought the Pandakai power up pack separately, thinking it would add a fun element, but we prefer playing the game in its original form. We do like having Pandakai as an additional monster option, though.It‚Äôs simple enough that 8 year olds and up would have fun playing this game, yet complex enough that it‚Äôs never boring.Our 4 and 6 year olds still play on ‚Äúteams‚Äù with a parent, but they love to roll the dice.We are so happy we bought this game for Christmas (almost 2 months ago).

  Tabletop gaming truly has reached a great renaissance lately, and this is a perfect example of it.  This game is relatively easy to learn, and I'd say the monsters all acting identically is actually a strength because of its simplicity.  This is essentially a king of the hill game, with all the players acting as generic mega-monsters out to crush human civilization.  You're not the only one though, as other horrific B-movie monsters also want to claim Tokyo as their own.  You can either play a dominance strategy, trying to take control of Tokyo and bash all other players to death, or go for more subtle glory through star power (points).  Players that opt for the survival strategy risk getting bashed by each other player, but if they manage to survive, they can bring the pain to all other players simultaneously on their turn!  Players going for victory by points still have to worry about whoever controls Tokyo, or risk them quickly running away with the game.  It's a very interesting kind of ""push your luck"" design that doesn't take long to explain at all, allowing players to get right into bashing each other silly!  Although I personally prefer King of New York, or at least using the Upgrade Pack, this clearly has the widest appeal.  If this is ""Yahtzee with monsters,"" why would you ever play Yahtzee again?

As Easy as Yahtzee - A Lot More Fun
","

  Three chances to roll the six dice - keep whichever dice you want after each roll, just like Yahtzee! It is this quick, simple game action that makes King of Tokyo fast and easy to learn, even for beginners. Special features that make it more challenging than Yahtzee: When you roll Smash, you only smash monsters that are NOT at your location (inside or outside of Tokyo); when you roll Healing (hearts), you only heal if you are Outside of Toyko; and you can only leave Tokyo if you've been dealt damage (but staying in for a full round gets you extra victory points). So do you take the smash and try to last until it's your turn again, or bail out, forcing the smasher to go into Tokyo? Super fun, quick game. My only complaint is that the cardboard score cards use rotating dials that don't stay in place very well, you constantly have to adjust (did I have 6 health or 7?) - otherwise awesome game - great graphics, and super creative special power cards!

  This was bought for our daughter‚Äôs seventh birthday and has provided endless hours of fun for the family. Easy to pick up, with just enough depth to entertain both adults and children, it‚Äôs highly reccomended! The mechanics are simple, but allow for strategy and planning, all of which can go out the window when the dice land a certain way.Although some multi-player table top games aren‚Äôt as fun with fewer people, this game holds up quite well in a duel situation, providing a different dynamic when only two players are present.We typically play the game with two adults and a child of 7; each time ends in a completely different way and is always enjoyable. The expansion sets provide enough variety to keep things fresh, should the base game become to stale.It‚Äôs not your typical childrens board game, but is highly reccomended for kids and adults alike!

  Fun, fast and easy game for the whole family. To me it plays like a video game, but with more interaction and more fun. The art work is adorable and being a monster is fun. Once you learn the rules, it goes fast. My 8 year old son and husband LOVE this game. It was easy enough that my 5 year old daughter and I teamed up against them and won. She would roll the die and ‚Äúadvise‚Äù me on which to keep. She did pretty good too.) This is definelty a good game if you want something about 15 to 30 min play. (Unless you are like us and we play a couple of rounds because there is no way you going to let someone else be King of Tokyo. If you are a board gamer, add this to your collection.

  My boys are 9 and 4. Wanted to find a game we could all play... you know, fun family game nights. WRONG. These kids are cutthroat! Aggressive, YOLO-style dice rolling. Healing?

I come back and amazingly, the kids have rolled exactly what they need. *grumble grumble*I'd knock a star off the rating for making it TOO easy for kids to play... but really, it's not their fault I get outsmarted by my kids.

  My new favorite board game. The different ways of winning (killing people, scoring points, using cards to power up and then score points) make for great strategic complexity and replay-ability. My friends and I have a lot of fun playing this and it's became a new favorite board game. The art and names of cards are also quite charming. If I had to nitpick, it feels like combat is a bit too powerful - in maybe 75% of games, the winner wins by killing the other players rather than scoring points. But that could just be our personalities

  I can't believe how simple, fast and fun this game is.  My 8 yr old absolutely loves it, and every time he's taken it to school for a class game day he tells me it was the most popular game of the day.  The only time he doesn't take it is when my 10 yr old is faster than him and snags it 1st.  I sometimes wish the different monsters had something to differentiate them instead of just the look of the cardboard play piece, but the formula to keep it really simple is working like a charm, so why change it I guess?  This is like Yatzee but cooler for kids.

  Quite possibly one of the most casual board-games that I have ever played, each game taking 30 minutes give or take. The mechanics are simple enough that my 7 year old nephew could play and have fun, but complex enough that my friends and parents enjoy playing it as well.The only reason it doesn't get 5 out of 5 is that the monsters only represent the players and have no special abilities of their own. Flat River Group eventually noticed this flaw and came out with an expansion that gives all monster uniqueness.That expansion is called POWER UP!, and I recommend getting it at the same time if possible to get the complete experience, but the original is still a fun stand alone game.

  Well made and entertaining game. I own a good number of board games and this is probably my second favorite dice game right behind BANG. I like how there are different strategies to win the game but strategies that are too difficult to understand that a first time player wouldn't have a chance to win against a veteran. The best way to win (i.e. try to kill off other monsters, go for power cards, go for victory points) will change depending on what gets rolled and the decisions of other players. My kids (8 and 5) both understand the game play and can play independently, however, the youngest still needs suggestions such as don't just buy a card just because you can. This game plays from 2-6 players but I think 4 is really the sweet spot. When you go more than 4, two spots open up inside Tokyo where your monster takes the most damage and I feel there is less skill involved, you can get thrown into Tokyo almost every round and not be able to heal during your turn. It feels more of a game of survival than planning out your best path to victory. Definitely worth a spot in your collection, especially given the wide age ranges that would enjoy playing it.

  We purchased KOT because we want a goood family game with a little luck involved.  Something we could kick out brains out of gear from playing Catan, Pureto Rico or Ticket to Ride, something with luck involved.  So, we ha heard & reviewed KOT and decided this dice game would do the trick.  We love KOT so we bought the power up expansion thinking we would like extra powers (it sounded good).  However, we didn't like it!  It slowed the game down, there was way to much going on....too many cards for us and we didn't like it slowing the game down to figure out what your vards did, because you had so many.

It works for casual to serious players, has a lot of different strategies, and isn't luck heavy enough to unbalance it.  It fits a broad age range, and is fun to jump into a game anytime.

  I cannot say enough about how much we love this game!  As a family of 5, it's sometimes hard to find a game we can all play and that we all love, but this one is the bomb!  It sounds much more confusing upon initial play than it really is.  I say it takes about 1 round and you're on your way to total Tokyo domination!  We even play on adult game nights and it's been loved and obsessed over by everyone who plays!

  The penguine score card keeper was broken when we opened the box. The brad doesn't stick so you can't turn the wheel, which is too bad since that is everyone's favorite character.My six year old can play this game and I enjoy it too (40 year old). Even my teenage daughter likes to play with us. Rules about some of the power cards are a little confusing - wish they had some rules clarifications somewhere.

  Lots of fun for family, both 7 and 12 year old enjoyed it along with adults. There are several different ways to win so each person can develop their own approach which makes it more complex and fun.

  One of the few games that my players enjoy across the board. I have a picky group, and this is a game that they will almost never say no to. It can be a little hard on new players in that pushing your luck at all almost always results in an elimination from the game. Once that lesson is learned the hard way, everyone tends to have a great time.

One of the best games of this century with an artwork update
","

  King of Tokyo is definitely a five star game. For us it has been the better gateway game than Catan because it's faster paced and you can play off-the-cuff turn to turn. This second edition didn't break anything. Really, it's a cosmetic overhaul.If you have King of Tokyo, you're not missing anything gameplay by skipping the second edition. If you don't have King of Tokyo, why aren't you buying this???It's a dice game. I've heard it called Yahtzee with monsters. And yeah, I can see that, but it has a lot more. There is a lot more interaction than Yahtzee with the battle theme. There are heavily unbalanced cards to collect and play, but that just adds to the outlandish gameplay. There's definitely more luck than strategy, but there's a real opportunity to make choices with what luck you're given. In a game of 4 people, you can all four go different ways in trying to win and it's hard to say which strategy will take it all. It's a great group game and is my church youth group's favorite game and I got this second edition to have a copy at our church.As far as the new version goes. I like the old artwork better. All the artwork looks more plasticy. The new board works the same with updated artwork of the same scene. And the Kraken is gone!!! Who in the world decided that a 3-2-1 Penguin poser was better than the mighty Kraken? ""Release the penguin"" in a small squeeky voice is just not the same as a thunderous ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN"". The cyber bunny has been replaced with cyber kitty--who cares. The card back and front artwork is updated (I think the card info is pretty much the same). The dice and energy cubes are the same.The possible problem is the lack of compatibility with expansions. Some of the expansions expect certain characters, and they've said there will be a version 2 Powerup expansion. So don't buy Powerup to go with this yet. The Halloween expansion that few like will not be updated, and the Halloween card backs are not compatible unless you put the cards in sleeves. I own the Halloween expansion but have never taken it out of the box so I can't speak for how much of a loss that is...The rules have been clarified slightly and I understand that the cards are also slightly clarified. But if you have version 1, you can get the rules from iellogames website and use them with version 1!So really if you have version 1, there's no reason to move up unless you have a strange penguin fetish. But if you don't have King of Tokyo--get this game! It's a lot of fun to play with 4-6 people.

A Solid, Delightful, Lightweight Euro-style Strategy Game (Whether You Enjoy MInecraft or Not)
","

  I didn‚Äôt pick this game up because I enjoy Minecraft (it‚Äôs a fine game in my eyes, just not my type).I do, however, enjoy collecting and playing boardgames where the theme of the game goes well with its mechanics. This boardgame does this very well and is a very solid design to boot. Players will either get blocks from a community resource cube, run their pawn to the nearest chest on the edges of the board to gather weapons to fight mobs, or build structures onto their mat possibly transforming the terrain in the process to score the most points they can. The player interactivity is light, but there, and meaningful. Grabbing blocks from the cube opens up more blocks for players to grab. Moving your pawn to unexplored areas opens that area up for players to plan and build with cubes that have been allocated. Clearing a layer of blocks from the cube also ends the round (which there are 3) and can potentially be a detriment to other players if their board isn‚Äôt built optimally for them to take advantage of what‚Äôs being scored that round. Turns have consequences. The game is satisfying in its lighthearted theme and is quite a pleasant space to compete in.Recommended.

Overly complicated and tedious for kids who play Minecraft.

  I hate giving negative reviews and I want to say that, some people might really enjoy this game... We found it really difficult to setup and overcomplicated to play... that's it really. Most of the game parts are made from cardboard... I don't know, just disappointed I guess... Just way, way, way too complicated for it to be fun for kids who actually play Minecraft and who are expecting a board-game version of the game... I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm sure folks worked hard on it... but it's probably going to the charity shop after one game, not sure I even feel comfortable doing that... :-(

Great game, not as complex as it seems at first!

  The game is overwhelming when you take it out of the box. So many different parts, and you end up covering the table with components. There are lots of different actions and the scoring seems confusing... I was thinking how can this be a game for kids?!BUT then you actually play it, and it all starts to make sense! You begin to see how all the different systems work and integrate with each other. It turns out this is a true eurogame with a bunch of depth.Some reviewers complained that this was too complicated for their kids, but honestly I don't think they tried to play it for long enough. Watch a YouTube video to give you the basics. Once my kids (7+9) learned how the battle system worked, they were HOOKED.The scoring system is very flexible and rewards many playstyles, from a strategic builder to a mob-focused brawler, so different ages of players will all have fun.Highly recommend it!

Great intro to euro-style games if you want something other than ticket to ride
","

  Purchased this as a Christmas present for our son. If your child loves board gaming, problem solving, and mine craft, he or she should like this.  Each turn you have a choice of the same 5 moves to earn experience points. If your child is quick to pick up patterns, he or she could play. Our 5 year old plays just fine, but also enjoys the ticket to ride series and Queen domino. It feels easiest to teach kids the game when playing just two players.It took 15-20 mins the first play to set up and read all the instructions.  Play time can very as players determine when to end rounds and end the game. We have ranged between 25-45 mins with 2 people.I would recommend this to families looking to give a tactile Minecraft experience to their kids or introduce a more complex, European style game to their family game night.

The best elements of Minecraft expertly tied into a board game!
","

  Wow! I can finally play Minecraft with my son and actually enjoy it! Wicked neat mechanics! I agree with the 10+ age recommendation as some of the mechanics are in depth. My 6 year old plays it but I can tell he struggles at times to stay focused. He loves the game due to it bei g Minecraft but I think he will enjoy it even more in a couple years.I love how you can mine from a resource block, find weapons, explore a world, fight mobs and build structures (via spending resources to buy a card). What a well thought out game! The only adjustment to rules we made was to make the move action (1-2 spaces) ""free"" and making the exploring (flipping over tiles) the ""action"". That way you can use your move to get to weapons, mobs, locations without wasting an action.

Good bridge between sons videogame hobby and my board game hobby
","

  I'll start by saying that my 11 year old is an avid Minecrafter. This was one of his picks for a Christmas gift, and the price and reviews looked decent, so we gave it a try. We've played it half a dozen times or so and have enjoyed it every time. The ONLY reasons it didn't get a full 5 stars are: 1- we found the ""stacking box"" for the square blocks to be a little bit flimsy. It works, but could have been a little bit better design. 2- Shuffling the weapons/tools tiles prior to combating a monster is a little bit clumsy, especially if you've collected quite a few tiles. Including a couple of simple pouches (draw a tile from the pouch instead of off a stack) would have been outstanding.  Other than these two VERY MINOR issues (that are admittedly easy to fix on your own) we've had nothing but enjoyment from this game.

  I enjoy this strategy game even with only secondhand knowledge of Minecraft. The age 10+ is a good recommendation, though. My advanced 9-year-old is fine and puts up a good strategy but my 6-year-old needs to play it cooperatively with an adult and even then wanders out during scoring. I like planning ahead for the multiple scoring rounds and think it‚Äôs a great mental exercise for older kids.

Good game. Very poor components
","

  Cheap components. This is especially disheartening coming from  Ravenburger and Mojang Official. The gameplay is actually really well designed. It does a good job of simplifying the video game mechanics into an original idea...The component quality is garbage. Let me start with the box. It's extremely thin, mine came with a fully dented corner and a small hole from shipping. The corners of the top are already splitting from just being opened a few times.The player pieces are very thin cardboard figure markers that you stick in a plastic base. These definitely won't last through much use.The combat in game requires constant shuffling and drawing of tokens. Which isn't a bad mechanic, but the very cheap nature of the material selected has led to some pieces already peeling and being bent. This is also true of the tiles used to make up the overworld.The player mats are very thin card stock.The only bright component feature is the robust wooden cubes.Overall this is a good game. It's cheaply priced and it's fun to play (even for non fans of the game) and has decent strategy.I just don't see this product lasting very long especially with younger kids playing it regularly.

Surprisingly great game
","

  I should start by disclosing that my family all love Minecraft and that likely played a major role in our enjoyment of this game. But it does a great job of respecting the IP.The game has a fair amount of RNG to it which I am a big fan of because it helps level the playing field and gives my 6 year old daughter a chance when playing against mom and dad. That said there is a lot of strategy and thinking that comes across in the scoring system. There are 3 rounds of scoring and they all depend on having structures on your board. Each structure has a biome, material and type associated to it. Round 1 your score is based on connected biome structures, round 2 material, round 3 type. So as you play you are thinking about how to score as many points in the current round but also thinking ahead to subsequent rounds. For my 6 year old she does not have to have the structures connected to score points as suggested in the rule book.If I had one complaint about the game it is that there is no mechanic for mining iron, diamond, gold, red stone etc. and you gain weapons by picking them up rather than crafting them.This is a great game regardless of the Minecraft IP but if you like Minecraft this is a must have. I sincerely hope the publisher considers releasing an expansion for this game as there is a lot they could do with it.
