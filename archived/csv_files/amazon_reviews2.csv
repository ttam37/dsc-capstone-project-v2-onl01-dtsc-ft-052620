I really liked this edition
","

  I really liked this edition. I used to have the 1998 edition as a kid, so the idea of only 5 armies, and cardboard containers was offputting to say the least. However, after having played the game again several times with my buddies, I do agree that 6 armies is too much for the actual gameboard. Even with 5 the board feels very crowded and there is a lot of pressure on the 5th player to find their footing, with 6 players, I can clearly see that someone would be eliminated within the first 3 or 4 turns. The cardboard containers are not as nice as the plastic ones that came with the 1998 edition, but they serve their purpose well. The game board lists that there are 40 infantry pieces per army, but all the armies in mine had 2 extra infantry pieces. The cards are built well enough, and the game includes the secret mission cards which can shorten the length of the game significantly. A lot of territories have different names in this edition, but i believe their placement and borders are all the same as before.  Overall I am very satisfied with the gameboard.

Best edition yet!!!
","

  As someone who has enjoyed this game for almost 30 years I have owned many sets/editions. This is my favorite by far. The superb quality of the box with its metal corners and leather like straps.To the detailed map board and cards! Even the textures/details of the soldiers are amazing. This set actually came with a few extra soldiers for each color (I got 44 each instead of 40)!!!

Hidden Dice - They ARE There! Check in the Army Boxes!
","

  After reading the reviews I was concerned about the Dice, so I opened the box and couldn't find them right away. I remembered reading a review on here saying they were included, just in a weird spot. So I looked in each little Army box, and finally found them in the Indigo/Purple colored box. So before you return your game, look in each box and double check, and look under the army figures too. I was prepared to buy the dice separately, if missing, but they were there.The game itself looks great, I was really impressed by the boxes full of the colored armies, such a nice way to keep organized. The figures are small and lightweight, but they seem decent, and they'll be better to play with than the little chips in some other versions of the game. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the purchase.

Risk Game
","

  I've never played the game before so it took about 3 full games to fully grasp the rules and concept.To break down the set up for anyone wanting to buy it;1. Seperate secret mission and land cards from each other.2. Deal out secret mission cards; 1 per person (you could win by completing it)3. Remove the 2 wild cards (has the infantry, horse, and cannon on one card) from the land cards and deal them all out. The last 2 players usually claim an extra land piece.4. Each player receives a set amount of troops (check rule book). Place 1 troop on all the places listed on your given land cards.5. Return the land card to the dealer and start placing your remaining troops on your land. And done you have set up the game and o yeah the dice are in one of the troop boxes.Note:Somethings that I discovered or want to clarify1. Moving your troops to place you own concludes your turn.2. You could only receive one Risk territory card per turn after you conquer a piece of land.3. You can only redeem territory cards at the beginning of your turn and any territory you own on the card receives a +2 troops.4. There's a route from Alaska that leads to Asia.

A classic!
","

  My son is into plenty of electronic games - be they tablet, console, PC, etc. - so I wanted to get him an actual board game to play for once.  I had fond memories of playing Risk with my friends 20+ years ago, and when I went looking for it Amazon had the best price.  The game has actually gotten better - the version I had included the old-school Roman numeral pieces, and the new ones look much better.  I also really like the addition of the Secret Mission way to play, because it's a much shorter game and you can finish a game in less than an hour if need be.

  My 10 year old son loves this game!  All of his friends seem to live it too!  The instructions explain 4 different ways to play; Secret Mission, Classic, Risk for 2 players, and Capital. It is great to have the choices. Secret mission risks seems to shorten the length of play, so when time is a factor, we play that version. My 5 year old even plays. He can play on a team with an adult.

  This is game is a classic! It was really neat to see an updated version of the game I grew up playing in the 90s.The game was safely packaged and had no problems in shipping or in quality. All pieces were in tact. The map board looks great! We opened it for our first play this past weekend.The game is great because you can play as a beginner or with an advanced strategy. You'll develop plans of where to start your armies, what favorite territories you like, etc. The instructions are easy enough to follow for people without any experience playing Risk.Bring snacks, drinks, and buckle up for a head-to-head fight over land!Great purchase!

A Good Edition of a Classic Strategy Game
","

  It's your standard Risk game with the classic 6 different colored armies (red, blue, green, yellow, pink, and... black, which is really brown), decks of territory and secret mission cards, dice, board, and rulebook in a box.The pieces are really nice. They are larger than previous versions (comparing to the 1998 and 2003 releases of the game) and have some nice detail to them.Gameplay is still the same. Although it is enjoyable for those new to strategy games, seasoned veterans may find it to be a bit dull. If you want to spice it up, I recommend getting 4-5 boxes of this version and 4-5 boxes of the $16.99 version (for an additional two colors: orange, and indigo... which is really black), print and laminate 3' × 4' maps from the 1995 PC game, 5 sets of 12-sided dice (white, yellow, green, red, and black), and get a copy of Same-Time Risk (game variant from the 2000 PC game) rules from the internet. I got some of my buddies hooked on it, and it truly immerses you into a more complex, exciting, and challenging game while keeping some of the same classic mechanics.If you're a novice to strategy games, this is a classic. If you want a more realistic, Napoleonic-style game, go with my recommendation in the last paragraph.

Dissapointing!!!
","

  The product is well designed and a total eye candy, the box it self was very cool to look at. However, the box was partially damaged and the soldier pieces were poor quality. Regular versions have higher quality pieces. Quality of the product was certainly most unpleasing experience. I was very excited to receive the copy and hyped after seeing the box lid and the design effort that was put into it. Unfortunately once you open the box and lok into individual token cases, its an reality shattering experience.I would recommend only if you are a hardcore risk fan and have other risk games to replace the parts, that's what I'm going to do. Otherwise just stick to the regular ones. They have higher quality.

Storage box to small and flimsy
","

  I give this 4 stars because of the game box and board are a pure joy to look at, but the storage boxes for the individual armies are too small and flimsy.  You will have to play Tetris to be able to get all your armies pieces back into their storage containers then spend a few more minutes trying to line up the little flimsy carboard flaps to close the tray. Would have been nice to get the little clear plastic army trays in this version instead of the paper thin, to small, flimsy carboard ones. That is my only real complaint about the 60th anniversary edition, it is still a wonderful game, and the game box and game board more then make up for the crappy army trays

  This is a great buy. For under $20 you can get a beautiful edition of Risk that will entertain (and challenge) you, family and friends for years. This edition features wonderful graphics for the map and cards. The sculpts of the pieces are really well done. I have loved many editions of Risk but I think this one is the most fun. Also, the regular 60th Anniversary edition (which is also awesome) uses the same graphics with a different coloration and textures and 6 armies rather than 5. Both are excellent editions.

  This is such a nice set compared to what I grew up with in the 90’s. ITD the same awesome game but it’s rare these days that a board game’s quality exceeds the earlier versions. Everything is boxed so nicely! I think this will definitely last many many years to come. We got this to play as a family while sheltering in place. It’s a little too advanced for my 7yo so we end up playing as a team but my gifted 9yo absolutely loves it and actually won several times. So don’t be afraid of the older age recommendations if you have a smart kid that would be interested in taking over the world :)

A Solid, Delightful, Lightweight Euro-style Strategy Game (Whether You Enjoy MInecraft or Not)
","

  I didn’t pick this game up because I enjoy Minecraft (it’s a fine game in my eyes, just not my type).I do, however, enjoy collecting and playing boardgames where the theme of the game goes well with its mechanics. This boardgame does this very well and is a very solid design to boot. Players will either get blocks from a community resource cube, run their pawn to the nearest chest on the edges of the board to gather weapons to fight mobs, or build structures onto their mat possibly transforming the terrain in the process to score the most points they can. The player interactivity is light, but there, and meaningful. Grabbing blocks from the cube opens up more blocks for players to grab. Moving your pawn to unexplored areas opens that area up for players to plan and build with cubes that have been allocated. Clearing a layer of blocks from the cube also ends the round (which there are 3) and can potentially be a detriment to other players if their board isn’t built optimally for them to take advantage of what’s being scored that round. Turns have consequences. The game is satisfying in its lighthearted theme and is quite a pleasant space to compete in.Recommended.

  I hate giving negative reviews and I want to say that, some people might really enjoy this game... We found it really difficult to setup and overcomplicated to play... that's it really.

Just way, way, way too complicated for it to be fun for kids who actually play Minecraft and who are expecting a board-game version of the game...

  The game is overwhelming when you take it out of the box. So many different parts, and you end up covering the table with components. There are lots of different actions and the scoring seems confusing... I was thinking how can this be a game for kids?!BUT then you actually play it, and it all starts to make sense! You begin to see how all the different systems work and integrate with each other. It turns out this is a true eurogame with a bunch of depth.Some reviewers complained that this was too complicated for their kids, but honestly I don't think they tried to play it for long enough. Watch a YouTube video to give you the basics. Once my kids (7+9) learned how the battle system worked, they were HOOKED.The scoring system is very flexible and rewards many playstyles, from a strategic builder to a mob-focused brawler, so different ages of players will all have fun.Highly recommend it!

Great intro to euro-style games if you want something other than ticket to ride
","

  Purchased this as a Christmas present for our son. If your child loves board gaming, problem solving, and mine craft, he or she should like this.  Each turn you have a choice of the same 5 moves to earn experience points. If your child is quick to pick up patterns, he or she could play. Our 5 year old plays just fine, but also enjoys the ticket to ride series and Queen domino. It feels easiest to teach kids the game when playing just two players.It took 15-20 mins the first play to set up and read all the instructions.  Play time can very as players determine when to end rounds and end the game.

The best elements of Minecraft expertly tied into a board game!
","

  Wow! I can finally play Minecraft with my son and actually enjoy it! Wicked neat mechanics! I agree with the 10+ age recommendation as some of the mechanics are in depth. My 6 year old plays it but I can tell he struggles at times to stay focused. He loves the game due to it bei g Minecraft but I think he will enjoy it even more in a couple years.I love how you can mine from a resource block, find weapons, explore a world, fight mobs and build structures (via spending resources to buy a card). What a well thought out game! The only adjustment to rules we made was to make the move action (1-2 spaces) ""free"" and making the exploring (flipping over tiles) the ""action"". That way you can use your move to get to weapons, mobs, locations without wasting an action.

Good bridge between sons videogame hobby and my board game hobby
","

  I'll start by saying that my 11 year old is an avid Minecrafter. This was one of his picks for a Christmas gift, and the price and reviews looked decent, so we gave it a try. We've played it half a dozen times or so and have enjoyed it every time. The ONLY reasons it didn't get a full 5 stars are: 1- we found the ""stacking box"" for the square blocks to be a little bit flimsy. It works, but could have been a little bit better design. 2- Shuffling the weapons/tools tiles prior to combating a monster is a little bit clumsy, especially if you've collected quite a few tiles. Including a couple of simple pouches (draw a tile from the pouch instead of off a stack) would have been outstanding.  Other than these two VERY MINOR issues (that are admittedly easy to fix on your own) we've had nothing but enjoyment from this game.

Fun game to win against my children
","

  I enjoy this strategy game even with only secondhand knowledge of Minecraft. The age 10+ is a good recommendation, though. My advanced 9-year-old is fine and puts up a good strategy but my 6-year-old needs to play it cooperatively with an adult and even then wanders out during scoring. I like planning ahead for the multiple scoring rounds and think it’s a great mental exercise for older kids.

  Watch the video from ""How to Play"" on YouTube to quickly learn the rules. My kids love this game. Scoring was confusing, but we got it. It has a simple micro deck building element, with movement, and building Minecraft stuff. Taking out bad guys 8s not a problem either. Easy to setup, and just enough variety for an adult to enjoy as well.

Good game. Very poor components
","

  Cheap components. This is especially disheartening coming from  Ravenburger and Mojang Official. The gameplay is actually really well designed. It does a good job of simplifying the video game mechanics into an original idea...The component quality is garbage. Let me start with the box. It's extremely thin, mine came with a fully dented corner and a small hole from shipping. The corners of the top are already splitting from just being opened a few times.The player pieces are very thin cardboard figure markers that you stick in a plastic base. These definitely won't last through much use.The combat in game requires constant shuffling and drawing of tokens. Which isn't a bad mechanic, but the very cheap nature of the material selected has led to some pieces already peeling and being bent. This is also true of the tiles used to make up the overworld.The player mats are very thin card stock.The only bright component feature is the robust wooden cubes.Overall this is a good game. It's cheaply priced and it's fun to play (even for non fans of the game) and has decent strategy.I just don't see this product lasting very long especially with younger kids playing it regularly.

Surprisingly great game
","

  I should start by disclosing that my family all love Minecraft and that likely played a major role in our enjoyment of this game. But it does a great job of respecting the IP.The game has a fair amount of RNG to it which I am a big fan of because it helps level the playing field and gives my 6 year old daughter a chance when playing against mom and dad. That said there is a lot of strategy and thinking that comes across in the scoring system. There are 3 rounds of scoring and they all depend on having structures on your board. Each structure has a biome, material and type associated to it. Round 1 your score is based on connected biome structures, round 2 material, round 3 type. So as you play you are thinking about how to score as many points in the current round but also thinking ahead to subsequent rounds. For my 6 year old she does not have to have the structures connected to score points as suggested in the rule book.If I had one complaint about the game it is that there is no mechanic for mining iron, diamond, gold, red stone etc. and you gain weapons by picking them up rather than crafting them.This is a great game regardless of the Minecraft IP but if you like Minecraft this is a must have. I sincerely hope the publisher considers releasing an expansion for this game as there is a lot they could do with it.

Minecrafter collectable

  This was a gift for my son who is a pretty big Minecraft fan. He loves this and this was one of the only things he asked for four his birthday! It was that and the new Minecraft game. I asked if he's diehe wanted iy, seeing that we never get around to playing games in this house. His answer was ""I still want it, just to have."" So, to my little Minecraft, this is a collectable. Collectables are kinda his jam. He's also on the autism spectrum, and collecting is something he began to enjoy since he could sort things at 18 months! Aspie parents knowwhatI'm talking about! :) So this Minecraft game was a hot for his 13th bday. Oh also! Customer service was excellent! The original order was lost in the mail and a me one was on the way, the same day I put in a request! And they expedited it! It arrived in two days, packaged well and on time.

  Playing Minecraft in a board game style is totally another enjoyable experience! You can explore the world, collect different blocks to build different structures, take weapons with different damage and attributes, and the most exciting part is to fight the mobs (Endies, Creepies, and others). Winning is determined by experience point accumulation and the multiple ways to accumulate and earning experiences is definitely another thinking challenge of fun!ps: [by Griefer Cube] I would like to build more buildings in Minecraft based on the building cards in the game.

Beautiful game components, light and easy rules with smooth gameplay
","

  There is no doubt about how great this game looks, you will be drawn in by the quality of the components and how visually pleasing it is out on your table.  We love that as well.In Tapestry you'll follow very simple rules to advance and build your own civilization from just discovering and making fire to eventually launching spaceships or creating AI singularities.  It sounds like quite a journey, and it is, you'll get the chance to advance however you want along 4 different tracks.  This is a very fun option and one that seems very well enjoyed by everyone we've played this with.  All the time while advancing on these tracks you'll use your civilization's special abilities to help grow and expand your territory and build up your city.There are a lot of fun parts of this game that play off of one another, and can generate unique ways for you to score victory points.  With so many ways to score points in different areas of the game board even new players will find themselves competing in score with experienced players.  So there is a nice balance between everything, unless you choose to spread yourself too thin on all the tracks you'll find it very competitive.We have a lot of fun playing this, my wife perhaps more so than me.  I do have a few problems with it that drop my personal thoughts on it a little.  It’s a simple game, this is not the issue though, I love a simple game, they are fun and exciting.  My problem is, this is a huge box game with so many things in it, so many abilities, possibilities, options, ways to score, ways to play.  There is just so much possible in this game, that for it to play so simply then kills it for me just a little bit.  I wanted more from it, being such a great put together game with great quality components and it being so vast in possibilities I just want a bit more complexity from it.My larger complaint with the game is the Rulebook; I am not satisfied with that at all.  It is not as descriptive or full as it needs to be.  There are many icons not explained, you can reference through an included sheet and match up things and eventually learn what something that isn't represented means.  The Warp Space tiles for example are not explained at all.  It could also have benefitted from a few play examples, or at least a simple setup guide.  Our very first game of this was a struggle of referencing rules online and referring to the Rulebook for answers we hoped we'd find but didn't.  You can learn the whole game this way, but the turnaround time on your first game or two could be decreased a lot with a better Rulebook.I still recommend this game and like to show it to new players.  It is not at all that I don't enjoy it; this one just falls slightly lower on my list as far as how much I like it.  I've enjoyed many of the other games from Stonemaier much more than this one, but my wife rates this one at the top of her lists, so again you can see it comes down to just personal preferences.It is for sure one to own and enjoy playing, I think it plays best with at least 3 players.  2 is a doable and works well but the added players do increase the tension and enjoyment for me.  There is an alternate Automa set of rules for playing a 3rd in a 2 player game.  I'll be sure to update once we've given that a try.

Gorgeous game but Little Expensive and Boring

  COMPONENT QUALITY:The game board, component pieces, art-work on all the cards is gorgeous as is expected from any Stonemaier game these days. Tons of painted miniatures and great production quality means that the game is fairly expensive. The rulebook is just 4 pages which feels insufficient to learn the game in detail.GAMEPLAY:The game looks complicated but is comparatively easy to teach as is evident from the short rulebook. It's described as Civilization game, but doesn't feel like one. It feels more like an abastract engine building game. It doesn't have right mechanics or theme to give you feel of managing economy, army, science, building/people etc. It does little bit of everything but not to the true depth. It makes for a pretty gateway game though.The asymmetric nature of civilization cards and randomly drawn tapestry cards means that some games could become really one-sided.CONCLUSION:Go for it if you like abstract engine building games or are a big Stonemaier fan.For me personally, overall gameplay itself is not that fulfilling to justify this expensive purchase.

  I enjoy this game. It has its flaws. Some civilizations are now powerful than others, but this has since been balanced out with a sheet you can download and print from the SM website.

  This game looks great, the art style is fantastic and at first glance, the concept is awesome. However, it feels like this game never went through any play testing, at all.

After playing the game at least three times, I still hadn't figured out all the rules, realizing at the scoring phase that I was still doing something wrong.

It's one of those games where it's easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master the moves so that they stack on each other. Component quality is top notch, and although there's lots of pieces and cards to set up, it comes with lots of bags to organize. Many will criticize the randomness of the card draws, civilization powers, or rolls of dice, but every game has that to some degree. The beauty of the game is learning how to use that randomness to your advantage. Highly recommend this game for anyone who has dipped their toes into European style board games and wants to take it to the next level!

  1-5 players, Competitive, Civ Creation Resource ManagementOverview of GameplayIn Tapestry players will be manipulating resource totals around in order to gain other items all in an effort to achieve those delish victory points. The game is actually very simple and ramps up the strategy the longer you play. A typical revolution around the board consists of each player either taking a “Advance” turn or an “Income” turn. An Advance turn is the primary turn player will be taking which consists of simply spending one (or more) of four resources to pay for the cost of advancing one of your player tokens up one of the four advancement tracks on the board. Doing this in turn allows the player to collect something such as a new invention card or exploration tiles which you can then manipulate depending on the actions.So around and around the table players will be doing this, each player trying to maximize the amount and quality of advancements they take before they have to move into a new era. BUT when a player does eventually run out of resources to spend they will have to take the second of two main actions, the Income turn. Now the income turn is very important as it not only refills some of your resources but gains you precious other things including victory points. The first thing you will be doing will be activating any action that your particular civilization has. Now some civs have ongoing abilities that activate during other points in any round but there are quite a few that ONLY activate at the beginning of the income turn. After that you will be playing one of your Tapestry cards to your player mat which will either unlock an ongoing benefit for you during the entire next era (which is the turns in between the Income turns) or some immediate benefit. After that you can upgrade one of your Tech cards if you have any played and collect vp’s based on whatever is uncovered on your player mat (from playing income buildings on your capital city mat) and finally gain some resources, the amount also based on uncovered areas on your player mat.Players will all be taking the income turn at different times depending on how efficient they were with their resource spending. Also you will only be playing a total of three Tapestry cards to your player mat over the course of the game so you do have some variety on which card to play when to try and gain the most benefit out of it. Once you take your fifth income turn, (one right at the onset of the game, one for each of the three placed tapestry cards and one more at the very end) your game is over. And since each players game may end at different times you can sit back and watch to see how others may stack up on points in comparison. Whoever ends the game with the most points, wins!Components/Game BoardOk let’s get into the meat and potatoes here. The components are excellent all around as to be expected from Stonemaier Games. The game has a premium feel coming off of it as soon as you open the box. The little income buildings have four different sculpts and colors to differentiate them. The cards all have a nice finish on them and they have a good thickness to them. The three custom dice all look great and have a nice hefty feel to them. But the big standout here is the landmark building minis. Each one is uniquely sculpted AND fully painted which really makes them standout and honestly they just look really cool. The board is also well designed with nice rounded edges and a kind of matte finish to it AND is also double-sided for different player counts.Now the player mats have this very nice rough texture to them that interestingly enough interacts with the resource tokens in a specific way. So playing the game you will be moving these four plastic tokens left and right on this track to determine how much of each you have to spend. Well depending on which side you flip each token you could have a nice smooth slide or a more “grabby” side that kinda sticks to the rough surface. Not sure if these were designed like that but I think it’s a nice touch. HOWEVER I do believe those resource tokens are a tad too big. I have fiddled quite a bit with these things and many times all four tokens end up crossing paths or all rest on the same section. The areas the tokens are meant to reside are just not big enough for the size of said tokens. The resource tokens themselves are shaped like the corresponding resource they are meant to represent. BUT they are peculiar shapes that everyone (including myself) has just given nicknames because we are not sure what they are. There’s a star and a mushroom and bag of gold and an……overweight middle-aged man.On top of that the color combos are kinda tricky to get down. Now each resources color corresponds to a particular colored income building BUT the color for the corresponding advancement track (where you will find most of its upgrades) is a completely different color. So as you are eyeballing your player mat plotting out an epic strategy based on certain income buildings you then have to search for the correct advancement track on the game board. One other minor thing the colors of the Farms (brown) and the houses (Gray) are kind of hard to distinguish on the game board, this of course could just be a “me” thing but I have done many double takes between those two specifically.There is also something to be said for table space. The board itself isn’t THAT big but you need space to one side for the tech and tapestry cards, the exploration tile piles, the landmark building board and the few other landmarks that don’t go on that particular board. Even after all that your player area commands a large swath of space as well. I’m super torn on how I feel about this as I do think once put together your player area looks fantastic HOWEVER the amount of space each player needs is very large indeed. Each player will pick a particular civilization to play as which is placed down in front of them, then players will take a generic player mat which is place to the immediate right of their civ mat. Now players will choose a particular capital city mat based on their starting location which is placed to the immediate right of the player mat. AND THEN you need to make sure you have space to the right of the capital mat for any tech cards you invent during the game.Now all this looks incredible when attached and laid out in front of you, a fine display indeed. But boy is it a table hog. Depending on the table you may have to end up just placing the three mats however you can to have them fit, WHICH of course works just fine and the only thing you will be missing is the conformity of the mats. But ugh, breaking them up is like breaking up the Power Ranger Megazord into the smaller and (less cool) pieces.One last thing, and this will basically fly into the face of everything I said about table space but I wish there as a small board to hold the other random six building miniature landmarks that are not a part of the advancement tracks. There is a board to hold the regular landmarks but the other six (which you can gain through invention cards) are just kinda set aside. Perhaps a bigger landmark board with a labeled section just for those? Or a separate smaller board even. Overall, really impressed with the components and game board with only a few minor “quality of life” things that don’t really affect gameplay being the downside.Box/StorageThe insert is pretty good. It houses all the landmark minis and even though they are not labeled and of different sizes, they are super easy to put up after you have played a couple times. Not only that, but there is a picture of the corresponding spots they go in on the side of the inner box. There are also two rather deep sections that you can store the tiles, dice and cards in with a clear topper to make sure everything stays in place. You will of course have to bag up all the rest of the components such as the income buildings and player tokens but the game comes with a bunch of baggies to do just that.Visual Appeal /ThemeThe overall theme of the game is civilization building. You pick from a very large batch of completely different civs right at the beginning and start improving your civilization through various enhancements. Now if you look TOO deep into the words and flavor of these advancements, it might bewilder you a bit. But just remember this game isn’t based on our REAL world’s progress, this game basically takes real world things and lays them out for each player and says, “take your pick, how do YOU want to advance”.An example of this is that a player could advance to nuclear weapons on one track but could still be stuck on pottery on another. Now for me this didn’t pull me out of the “realism” of the game at all as I just took those words more as flavor than anything. I mean considering you are primarily advancing to get those luscious benefits, not the flavor, it makes sense.The artwork both on the board and the cards is excellent and the different civ mats look excellent as well. Overall super impressed with not only the artwork, but style. The only thing that could be tweaked would be that some of the colors are a bit too muted. Primarily the grays and browns for those respective income buildings.RulebookOmg. The return of the soft, supple rulebook! Before I opened my copy I had read that the book was only 4 pages and for a moment was like whaaaa? But then read that it also was made of the same material that the Wingspan rulebook is. Pre-Ordered. The softness of these pages cannot be overstated. I need a blanket of this, a full four page Tapestry rulebook blanket.But yeah four pages! That’s nuts if you think about it, and these are not four pages crammed with tiny printed information either. There are some picture examples and, overall, very well explained rules. Now that said there were a couple things I had to infer as they weren’t literally spelled out for me and a thing or two that I assumed based around other rules but overall very impressed with this rulebook. It does a very good job of getting you into the game and playing very quickly.Now the Automa rulebook was much more challenging to comprehend. That rulebook was also super short but after one read through that I had MANY more questions. The actions are more confusing and I think a better explanation of each automa action with picture example would improve it. One particular automa action had me really scratching my head for a while until I deciphered it and I think it mostly boiled down to the way it was worded. Of course after finally figuring out how it’s played, looking back the actions are really simple, it’s just understanding it in the first place.Player Interaction/Fun FactorThe player interaction is pretty low. On a normal turn you will be manipulating your own player mat to meet your own ends. That said, there are many things that players can do that will impact other players in some way. Players will be climbing these advancement tracks and as they do the first player to reach each new tier will gain one of those special and unique landmark minis to add to their personal capital city mat. There are only ONE of each of these so the first to nab it is it.Speaking a little more on those and the capital city mat, when players gain income buildings and landmarks they add them to this mat to try and fill in spaces in an effort to complete 3x3 sections and full rows and columns. For each 3x3 section filled up you can gain any one resource and for each row and/or column filled nets you victory points. So the primary thing to being the first to snatch these landmarks is that you can fill up quite a few spaces all at once on your capital mat whereas the little income buildings only take up one tiny little square each. To be honest though I do wish the landmark buildings did give some other differing bonus OTHER than just filling up spaces. I mean there are some cards that give you more points based on how many landmarks you have but that’s only IF you draw and place those.SO back to player interaction, another form of interaction comes from the conquering of territories. As you explore and lay down new tiles (which also give vp’s and usually some other reward) you are opening up a whole new world of land to potentially take over. As you progress up the military advancement track you can plop down these little control point tokens of your player color on adjacent explored tiles. If you happen to toss one down on a tile that already has just one of another players color then you basically overthrow them from the land and take it over. Toppling their control tower but leaving it there as a grim reminder to never dare resist them again. In game terms once a tile has two control tokens on it, you CANNOT overthrow it, so even a toppled token still counts as one. BUT if you do this and the other player (who you are attempting to overthrow) slaps down a “Trap” card then it is YOU who is overthrown! These devious trap cards are disguised as regular Tapestry cards so players never really know what you have in hand.Mostly though the player interaction is pretty limited. The downtime honestly isn’t that bad though since you are constantly scanning the board and your player mat to plot out your next turn as others are taking theirs. As the game progresses the turns do get a bit longer since the cost of advancements is continually on the rise as you move up the tracks and placements on your capital mat get even more strategic as you start filling up sections. However players with AP will find this game chock FULL of difficult choices. So many options to take with so many ways to take them depending on which resource to spend and the way choices will cascade and create new openings. Personally I love this aspect of the game, the way you can do one simple action and it turns into a massive multi-action turn.Also depending on the civ you pick you can really get a cool engine going focusing on a certain method of play. For example I have played as the Craftsman (one of my favs) and they focus on building up a massive statue instead of building up their capital city. This means when you gain those little income buildings you can place them on your civ card instead and gain specific rewards there. BUT by doing this you are basically forfeiting all those row/column bonuses you would normally get for building up a large capital city. This in turn means you probably don’t need to focus so much on placing the “house” income buildings since those focus more on improving the vp gain of those bonuses. WHICH in turn means you can really focus on bringing out some of the other income buildings more fully. I love this. I love how each different civ brings out specific strategies for play and there are even civs that are balanced around doing whatever you want by basically just giving you extra resources or advancing your advancement paths a little quicker.Optimal Player Count/ReplayabilitySo the board is double-sided, one side for the 1-3 player count and the other side with a bigger starting area for the 4-5 player count. All AP prone players aside, the way this game plays out I would suggest starting at lower player counts to learn it and then ramping up as everyone becoming familiar. I mean the same could be said for any game I suppose but this one in particular is so much more enjoyable when everyone has a good grasp on what is going on. I have seen learning games of five players take around four hours and fully learned games of three/four players take around an hour and a half. Even after a SINGLE game though it becomes very apparent what you need to focus on first for your next game which cuts down play time significantly. For example, my wife went wild trying to get out “houses” to her capital city board on her first learning game only to find out that those are really only beneficial if you have a large amount of rows/columns filled up. So probably not a good section to start clearing income buildings starting out.Also there are instructions to add a “shadow” AI player into the mix if you play a two player and solo game which creates a bit more urgency to those games. Basically that critter will be trying to gobble up those precious landmark buildings before other players. You don’t HAVE to add that in, but it’s there which I really enjoy. Speaking on the solo mode a bit more, once you figure out how to play it’s a really fun game! Since the actions are pretty simple it’s as easy as moving a particular AI token up on an advancement track and the actions the AI takes are clearly labeled on these nice reference cards so you can whip through turns pretty quickly. Plus the points during each AI income turn ramps up DRASTICALLY each era it goes through. So, speaking from personal experience here, don’t let your guard down. I was so sure I had a win under my belt because of my commanding lead only to be defeated on the last era because of its massive point gain.I think the replay value game here is very large. Beyond the decently sized decks of different Tapestry cards and invention cards there are SO MANY different civilizations to choose from that each game is a completely different experience. I went through each one and read up on them to try and sort them out into piles of similarities. I only found two that really focused on just gaining you flat out resources every income phase and two that really focused on advancing your tracks. The rest were unique enough from each other that you could easily form entire game changing strategies from them. For example the Inventors focus on gaining benefits from yours or others invention cards and you could form an entire strategy of bringing out that certain income buildings to your capital that enhances the vp gain you get from how many tech cards you have. And this is just one example of a plethora of options.Positive Final ThoughtsThis is a very fun and exciting game where you can form all kinds of different strategies based around your specific civilization. Not only that, but it seems like whichever strategy you employ has its own merits. Just going in on one of the more “basic” civs you can delve down certain advancement tracks and see how the game differs between you and opponents. It’s truly a marvel to behold. With the large amount of options for player count this game is very wide open for both play style and quantity or players.Negative Final ThoughtsTable space can be an issue for those with limited sized tables but at the same time I would like a mat for the extra six landmarks. I wish the income building’s and the resources had more clearly labeled differentiators to tell them apart as when I teach the game I end up calling them by their color BUT, at least for me, the colors are muted enough (the gray and browns particularly) that I still have to point them out. I also wish the landmark buildings had more going on with them other than just their size and ability to take up more spaces on the capital city mat.

My wife loved it, so that’s a winner for me!

  I got into more advanced board games only within the last six months and Scythe was kind of my gateway game. I wanted to try another game to mix it up. Of course after research I came across several other good games (Gloomhaven etc.) but I decided to go with Tapestry since it’s a Stonemeier game and I really appreciate the extreme effort they put into the quality of their materials. Even rulebooks just FEEL high quality and I really appreciate that. Should also mention I really wanted to try Wingspan as I am told it is more popular, but at the moment that one is supposed to be sold out through Spring 2020.Anyway, this game is not like Scythe at all in terms of gameplay and thats not a bad thing. The rule book was just a few pages and super easy to pick up and understand. I also really appreciate how the rules reference can quickly explain what certain icons mean. My wife was on the fence about taking on another one of my new games but she understood it really quickly and now can’t wait to play again! Those of you with spouses who aren’t naturally big gamers know how exciting it is when they want to play the games you enjoy.Is it a game you will play over and over and over again? Maybe not. And I’m not sure if it’s worth it’s current $109 cost (I’d say 69-79 is more appropriate). But I really enjoyed it a lot and it’s one I plan to play again!

A Hit from Stonemaier, but not their best Solo version
","

  If you like Stonemaier in general, or excellent, creative strategy games, this is for you. I often get caught up in my own storybuilding and forget to compete as hard as I should, it's that enjoyable. This is my favorite to come out of this studio so far.  That said, I love when games give me solo options. And this is the most convoluted, difficult to learn solo version I have come across. Which makes sense, SM usually brings in another designer to revamp for 1-player. So if you're looking for great 1-player versatility, this isn't it, but otherwise, it's a big win.

  The theme is definitely not immersive, as you do not feel like you are building a civilization. That said, the gameplay is incredibly engaging. The choices are simple yet satisfying; you choose to advance on any of the four tracks. Since the choices are not complex, it is not a brain burner. In fact, it feels like it plays quickly, despite being a longer game. If you like Stonemaier games, you will likely enjoy this one too.

  Stonemayer macht nunmal schöne Spiele. So auch hier: Tapestry ist wirklich wunderschön. Komplett anders, als Scythe und trotzdem: man will es alleine wegen der schönen Komponenten spielen.Die Regeln sind schnell drin, man kann es problemlos als Kennerspiel einstufen. Es spielt sich schnell und flüssig, dabei aber nicht etwa mechanisch oder repetitiv. Es bietet auch für viele Partien genug Abwechslung, und bleibt bis zum Ende spannend. Soweit die (sorry, will nicht spoilen, deshalb recht oberflächlichen) Positiva.Aber: da gibt es ein paar Momente, die nicht jedem gefallen werden. Einerseits hat es Würfel, die, vor allem der zwölfseitige, ziemlichen Einfluss auf das Spiel haben können, andererseits,Karten, die man zieht, die in ihrer Macht recht unausgeglichen sind. Ergo: es kann passieren, dass man eine sehr gute Strategie verfolgt, dann aber ein Widersacher mit einer ordentlichen Portion Glück dann an einem vorbeizieht. Das kann frusten und wirkt etwas „unpoliert“...Sieht man aber darüber hinweg und spielt Tapestry, das nun auch keine Ewigkeit dauert (ca. 75min mit vier Leuten, die es können), als „Casual+-Worker Placement/Territory Control“, dann kann man eine Menge Spaß haben.Zur besseren Einschätzung, ein paar Titel, denen ich fünf Sterne geben würde: Terraforming Mars, Terra Mystica, The Gallerist, Blood Rage, Brass, aber bspw. auch Port Royale oder Welcome to your perfect home.

  Tapestry is one of the best produced games of all times. Without a doubt. Though this is one of those board games which did not enjoy much love among cult board gamers due to some balancing issues here and there, my group and i loved it (with a few house rules adjusted). Some people did complain that this is not a civic building game but i find it exactly the opposite. You get a civilization with some unique features (acc to which you will have to adjuat your strategy) and you have 4 different paths to advance your civilization on (military, science, exploration and inventions) and there is also a central map board to explore tiles on and conquer areas to gain certain resource/benefits. Sounds pretty much a civilization building game to me. The only complaint i have from this game is the conflict which is very minimal and sometimes completely unnecessary, but then again, most Euro games do shy away from conflicts and battles. This is a beautiful engine building civilization game which will test your brains for sure. Now, coming to the production, as mentioned earlier, is beautiful. Special mention to the playeraids which are so informative yet crisp. It exactly does the job for which it was made.Overall, it is a fun Euro style civic engine building game with alot of choices. Moreover, there are so many ways to win this game that it never gets booring. Each time i play this i end up discovering a new strategy.

  I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox announced that the seventh season of KOTH would be coming out on dvd soon. 2007 came and went, no dvds. Fox announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first. I reckon Fox needs to be schooled on that lesson.Flash forward to 2014. After nearly nine dang years of praying for this to come out, Olive Films comes to the rescue and starts releasing KOTH on dvd. Now I read some reviews on here and I got mighty scared to buy this, I tell you what. People were saying that their screens would just go black after an episode and not return to the menu, the dvds wouldn't play, and someone was even talking about dang tv logos at the beginning of the shows. I don't know if they got bad bootleg copies or what but the set I have plays perfectly. There are no tv logos and my dvds go back to the main menu after each episode. Every time, man, every dang time.Yeah man, I tell ya what, man. Those dang ol' Fox flipper dvds, man. No worries, man, no worries. All 23 uncut episodes are on three single sided dual layered dvds. Let me break it on down for y'all:Disc One:01 Get Your Freak Off02 The Fat And The Furious03 Bad Girls, Bad Girls, Whatcha Gonna Do04 Goodbye, Normal Jeans05 Dances With Dogs06 The Son Also Roses07 The Texas Skilsaw Massacre08 Full Metal Dust JacketDisc Two:09 Pigmalion10 Megadale11 Boxing Luanne12 Vision Quest13 Queasy Rider14 Board Games15 An Officer And A Gentle Boy16 The Miseducation Of Bobby HillDisc Three:17 The Good Buck18 I Never Promised You An Organic Garden19 Be True To Your Fool20 Racist Dawg21 Night And Deity22 Maid In Arlen23 The Witches Of East ArlenVideo: The episodes are presented in a solid 1:33 transfer just like they aired. The colors pop and for the most part everything looks good. Sometimes I'll notice some jaggies in certain scenes but it isn't too dang bad or distracting.Audio: English 2.0 and Spanish 2.0. The audio is clear sounding and I have no complaints.Subtitles: EnglishExtras: Boy, I tell you what, man, this dang ol' set just has the episodes and nothing else. Dang ol' bare bones dvd. Dang it!

Olive Films Cons

  If you didn't already know, King of the Hill DVD releases from Fox ceased after season six, and years later the rest of the show was released by Olive Films. While it is nice to be able to own the whole series, Olive Films season seven set has some minor differences that I'm sure fans who own seasons 1-6 would like to be aware of. First off, while the discs are single-sided and don't require flipping like the previous sets, there is a slight loss in picture quality as a result. I watch the show on a 65"" 4K television, so those with lesser displays may not notice, but on my end the picture is not as clear, there are a lot of noticeable jagged lines, and there are quick instances of visible interlacing. These are not issues I had with the previous sets, and they don't warrant skipping out on this release, but they are worth noting. Also, there is no longer a chapter break after the opening theme song, so while I could hit ""Skip"" to bypass the intro on previous sets, I cannot on the Olive Films season seven release because it will bring you to the mid-mark of the episode. Instead one must manually fast-forward if they don't want to see the theme song before every episode.

Good show, Great to have the set. Good packaging
","

  I just revived my copy of season 7 and 8 on physical DVD Like many other fans I am thrilled to get to own seasons 7 and 8 on DVD. I'm not a big fan of digital distribution so when I herd they were being released on DVD a few months ago I instantly  pre-ordered.Both season 7 and 8 feature nice packaging in the style of normal size cases with a swing flap that I personally prefer over the older style fold outs or slim cases. The artwork is nice and colorful. The cases are clear and an episode list is printed on the reverse side of the art work.I was happy to see that the three discs are single sided and not flippers. They house about eight episodes a disc. The only small drawback for me is that there are no bonus features at all. I am still extremely happy with everything else. I hope Olive Films will continue to release the remaining seasons on DVD. These two sets have been the first DVDs I have ever pre-ordered, and I would be more then happy to pre-order the rest of the seasons as they become available.

  Such an excellent show, one of the best-of-all-time in my personal opinion. Filled with laughs that address the times it was made in, it can be appreciated by both adults & children alike. Anyone who grew up in the 2000s should have an appreciation for this show which brings a level of nostalgia to the table. Written, produced, & directed by some of the same people responsible for the American-version of the ""The Office,"" if you like this show, you'll love ""King of the Hill.""

  The seller shipped my order promptly and it arrived in perfect condition. The season comes in a case that is single DVD size and holds three discs, so I like the space-saving aspect. I am collecting all if the seasons of King of the Hill, my favorite show, but this season, season 7, is just damn boring. So I give all seasons prior a 5 star because they are awesone and this one a three because they are okay.

  A wrong has finally been righted with the release of Seasons 7 through 10 of ""King of the Hill,"" an animated classic. The characters were all likeable, even Peggy when the writers began dumbing down her character. As much as I loved the risque animated shows like ""The Simpsons,"" ""Family Guy,"" and ""Futurama"" (which was less risque than the former two), it was nice to see a show about a normal family in a normal neighborhood. I'm clinging on to the hope that the remaining three seasons will see release on DVD before the end of the year. I understand that it was considered by Fox that it was not financially viable to release the remaining seasons on DVD (which is why ""Malcolm in the Middle"" has only seen one season on DVD); well, whatever the reason, I'm just glad that we fans now have these classics.

King Of The Hill Is Back!!!!

  Well, I’ve never thought I’d see the day when King Of The Hill seasons 7-13 would finally be on DVD…It’s about fricking time!! Two Thumbs way way up for Olive Films for getting the rights to distribute the rest of this awesome show!! Now for the people leaving two, and one star ratings complaining about the DVD Quality? Claiming that the show won’t go back to the episode menu if you decide to watch it by episode? Well, either they have jacked up DVD players, or they’re lying sacks of dirt! I’ve tested it on my personal Desktop computer, My PS3 gaming console and my Sony Blu-Ray player and the disks play just fine!!! You can either watch all the episodes back to back, or individually. It works fine!Now for the people whining about Special Features, They pretty stopped doing all that after season 3 or so. Once they tell you how they draw the characters, and demonstrate how the show is made, it makes sense that they would eventually stop… right?Anyway, Thanks Olive Films for doing this for all the fans of King Of The Hill!

The best episode in a strong Season 7
","

  The best episode in a strong Season 7 -- indeed, one of the best in the whole series. The main characters are at their most believable (the episode's early stages positively crackle with authenticity), it moves along crisply and logically and the script is consistently hilarious, thanks not least to an inspired, detailed performance by David Cross as lead ""witch"" Ward Rackley. (KotH always got the best out of its guest stars.) Even the ending works -- and this is where many otherwise excellent episodes of the show fall down. Simply brilliant from start to finish.

King of the Hill Season 7 Instant video.
","

  I love this show and wish they would put the rest of the series on DVD, Hopefully they still will. But for now this is the only option. I bought the season and downloaded the episodes and the Amazon Unbox player to my computer. Depending on the speed of your computer it could take a while for the episodes to download. It took almost a whole day (24hrs) to finish downloading all 23 episodes. Plays well on the Unbox player and if you sync your compatible blu-ray player or device that has the amazon instant video app, It plays great on there too. If you watch using the instant video app on a compatible device you do not need to download the episodes they just play from your videos that you purchased. For me the video quality is good and the sound is great. I first bought this on itunes but would not play properly through itunes on my computer. I did not have an Ipod to test it on there. Price is also cheaper here on amazon. So I would recommend purchasing from Amazon Instant Video.

I needn't had, its sleek and with fantastic RPG detail.Replay-ability - Solo, multiplayer, cooperative, competitive its got them all.Allthough the gameplay is easy to pick up the game evolves as you go, and you can adapt it as you wish.It even has story/mission/objective cards to throw in later to spice things up.

  -5 stars plus 20 temporary starsThe title is Bag Of Dungeon.You need to escape a dungeon. To win you must escape WITH the ring. The Ring Of Creation appears when the last tile is placed. Each turn you need to move, battle, use some items, and make the dungeon with APs (Action Points).My most favourite thing to do is (drum roll please) SLAYING MONSTERS!!!!!! My fave item is The Blade Of Death. I created The Blade Of Death (NOT with The Ring Of Creation LOL) with the spare item tiles. Spare item tiles are tiles to replace worn-out items/monsters or… create your own! If The Blade Of Death is your only item +6 to battle roll. If it is your last item (inventory full) +11 to battle roll.I wouldn’t change anything about the game. I love the game as it is so there is nothing I don`t like.

I want to love this game, but just cannot
","

  At one time this was my number one most excited board game that I ever wanted to own.Now, this is my number one disappointment for games I've ever bought.  It's collecting dust and sits on my shelf.  Don't think though it's not because we don't play it or don't try to play it, because we did.  I kept pulling it off the shelf at game nights only to hear my Group of 4-6 players usually moan and groan, but I persisted.  I told them it would be different this time, that we could try a different house rule or online play variation I had read about.  We could get energy faster so the cards actually become usable, and we would remove many of the cards that just had useless effects.With each play, each attempt at changing playstyles on my part to make it fun for others, each time we tried to make it better it  just worsened for us.There is little to no point in every collecting energy and buying cards, the game just doesn't last long enough for that.  One of two things will happen in ever game.  Everyone will roll entirely for claws and go last monster standing, and in games of 4-6 you hardly get a turn or two before people are dropping like flies just from die rolls.  Or instead of claws some or everyone rolls purely for victory points, which can make the game even more boring and someone can win even faster.I just found in the end it wasn't worth even pulling to the table anymore.  Which is sad because, I LOVE the theme, the standees, the power up cards, the funny characters and powers.  I love it all as its individual components, it just doesn't feel like there is a game left over in the end.  You would leave everything in the box and just roll the dice until someone reaches 20 points and play the same game.I want to like it, I want to love it again, I just don't think that will ever happen for me or our Group.  I wanted to save this game so much in my collection that I even added the Power Up Expansion hoping it would fix things.  Sadly it also did not help.Great looking game, nice components, pointless parts of the game play and plays faster than setup and breakdown of it.

A quick fun game for the family, or a filler game while you wait for your last gamer friend to drive over/pick up food.
","

  This 2-6 player game is fairly quick and simple to play. You roll dice like you would in Yahtzee, and you try and either accumulate points or knock the other monsters out.There's strategy, so it's not all dice rolling, but I would say that luck plays a bigger factor than actual skill in this game. But it's not as lopsided in the luck department like in Yahtzee by any means.There are also some cards that you can buy to either help improve your monster, or to help harm other monsters.All in all, it's a fun family game that doesn't take up a lot of time, and even younger kids can enjoy. There is the unlikely scenario where a person gets knocked out very early in the game, and if it's a child, she/he might be angry or upset that she/he has to sit on the sidelines whilst she/he waits for the game to end.

Good. Could have been great. Modified rules make it more fun for 2.
","

  I write this review coming from a two player standpoint.Overall I like the idea. A battle of Kaiju over Tokyo. At the start, it's a dice rolling press-your-luck game. Glorified Yahtzee. But what makes this unique is the dynamic of not healing while in Tokyo, the ticking clock of staying in Tokyo, and the cards.What a shame, is that the game is over VERY quickly. And it seems like the cards and income accrual just aren't there before the clock runs out. I would much prefer it to last a little longer. Not using the cards are a shame because those are what makes the game more interesting!Modified rules can help and are likely needed. Such as getting two energy cube (currency) per die. Or double health (""die"" then resurrect with a penalty, like a Street Fighter game).I really do think it needs a second revision to address these issues.But this is coming from the perspective of only playing in two player. A 4,5,6 player game may be totally different.

Our New Favorite Game
","

  We love King of Tokyo. It’s easy to learn how to play, combining dice rolling (like Yahtzee) with monsters and power cards.  There are two ways to win, either get 20 Victory Points first or be the last monster standing (alive).This is one of our go-to games when friends are over (we enjoy playing games like Dominion, Survive, 7 Wonders, Pandemic, 6 Nimmt, Feast or Famine, etc).A game usually takes us around 30 minutes to play (even with 6 players, though we often play with 3).  We have so much fun, that most times we immediately play it again.We bought the Pandakai power up pack separately, thinking it would add a fun element, but we prefer playing the game in its original form. We do like having Pandakai as an additional monster option, though.It’s simple enough that 8 year olds and up would have fun playing this game, yet complex enough that it’s never boring.Our 4 and 6 year olds still play on “teams” with a parent, but they love to roll the dice.We are so happy we bought this game for Christmas (almost 2 months ago).

  Tabletop gaming truly has reached a great renaissance lately, and this is a perfect example of it.  This game is relatively easy to learn, and I'd say the monsters all acting identically is actually a strength because of its simplicity.  This is essentially a king of the hill game, with all the players acting as generic mega-monsters out to crush human civilization.  You're not the only one though, as other horrific B-movie monsters also want to claim Tokyo as their own.  You can either play a dominance strategy, trying to take control of Tokyo and bash all other players to death, or go for more subtle glory through star power (points).  Players that opt for the survival strategy risk getting bashed by each other player, but if they manage to survive, they can bring the pain to all other players simultaneously on their turn!  Players going for victory by points still have to worry about whoever controls Tokyo, or risk them quickly running away with the game.  It's a very interesting kind of ""push your luck"" design that doesn't take long to explain at all, allowing players to get right into bashing each other silly!  Although I personally prefer King of New York, or at least using the Upgrade Pack, this clearly has the widest appeal.  If this is ""Yahtzee with monsters,"" why would you ever play Yahtzee again?

As Easy as Yahtzee - A Lot More Fun
","

  Three chances to roll the six dice - keep whichever dice you want after each roll, just like Yahtzee! It is this quick, simple game action that makes King of Tokyo fast and easy to learn, even for beginners. Special features that make it more challenging than Yahtzee: When you roll Smash, you only smash monsters that are NOT at your location (inside or outside of Tokyo); when you roll Healing (hearts), you only heal if you are Outside of Toyko; and you can only leave Tokyo if you've been dealt damage (but staying in for a full round gets you extra victory points). So do you take the smash and try to last until it's your turn again, or bail out, forcing the smasher to go into Tokyo? Super fun, quick game. My only complaint is that the cardboard score cards use rotating dials that don't stay in place very well, you constantly have to adjust (did I have 6 health or 7?) - otherwise awesome game - great graphics, and super creative special power cards!

  This was bought for our daughter’s seventh birthday and has provided endless hours of fun for the family. Easy to pick up, with just enough depth to entertain both adults and children, it’s highly reccomended! The mechanics are simple, but allow for strategy and planning, all of which can go out the window when the dice land a certain way.Although some multi-player table top games aren’t as fun with fewer people, this game holds up quite well in a duel situation, providing a different dynamic when only two players are present.We typically play the game with two adults and a child of 7; each time ends in a completely different way and is always enjoyable. The expansion sets provide enough variety to keep things fresh, should the base game become to stale.It’s not your typical childrens board game, but is highly reccomended for kids and adults alike!

  Fun, fast and easy game for the whole family. To me it plays like a video game, but with more interaction and more fun. The art work is adorable and being a monster is fun. Once you learn the rules, it goes fast. My 8 year old son and husband LOVE this game. It was easy enough that my 5 year old daughter and I teamed up against them and won. She would roll the die and “advise” me on which to keep. She did pretty good too.) This is definelty a good game if you want something about 15 to 30 min play. (Unless you are like us and we play a couple of rounds because there is no way you going to let someone else be King of Tokyo. If you are a board gamer, add this to your collection. I’m glad I did.

  My boys are 9 and 4. Wanted to find a game we could all play... you know, fun family game nights. WRONG. These kids are cutthroat! Aggressive, YOLO-style dice rolling. Healing? Who needs stinkin' healing. MOAR ATTACK! Secret alliances. There mom gets in on the action. It's their turn to roll... and surprise surprise, she needs me in the kitchen for something. I come back and amazingly, the kids have rolled exactly what they need. *grumble grumble*I'd knock a star off the rating for making it TOO easy for kids to play... but really, it's not their fault I get outsmarted by my kids.

  My new favorite board game. The different ways of winning (killing people, scoring points, using cards to power up and then score points) make for great strategic complexity and replay-ability. My friends and I have a lot of fun playing this and it's became a new favorite board game. The art and names of cards are also quite charming. If I had to nitpick, it feels like combat is a bit too powerful - in maybe 75% of games, the winner wins by killing the other players rather than scoring points. But that could just be our personalities

  I can't believe how simple, fast and fun this game is.  My 8 yr old absolutely loves it, and every time he's taken it to school for a class game day he tells me it was the most popular game of the day.  The only time he doesn't take it is when my 10 yr old is faster than him and snags it 1st.  I sometimes wish the different monsters had something to differentiate them instead of just the look of the cardboard play piece, but the formula to keep it really simple is working like a charm, so why change it I guess?  This is like Yatzee but cooler for kids.

  Quite possibly one of the most casual board-games that I have ever played, each game taking 30 minutes give or take. The mechanics are simple enough that my 7 year old nephew could play and have fun, but complex enough that my friends and parents enjoy playing it as well.The only reason it doesn't get 5 out of 5 is that the monsters only represent the players and have no special abilities of their own. Flat River Group eventually noticed this flaw and came out with an expansion that gives all monster uniqueness.That expansion is called POWER UP!, and I recommend getting it at the same time if possible to get the complete experience, but the original is still a fun stand alone game.

Dice game with solid mechanics

  Well made and entertaining game. I own a good number of board games and this is probably my second favorite dice game right behind BANG. I like how there are different strategies to win the game but strategies that are too difficult to understand that a first time player wouldn't have a chance to win against a veteran. The best way to win (i.e. try to kill off other monsters, go for power cards, go for victory points) will change depending on what gets rolled and the decisions of other players. My kids (8 and 5) both understand the game play and can play independently, however, the youngest still needs suggestions such as don't just buy a card just because you can. This game plays from 2-6 players but I think 4 is really the sweet spot. When you go more than 4, two spots open up inside Tokyo where your monster takes the most damage and I feel there is less skill involved, you can get thrown into Tokyo almost every round and not be able to heal during your turn. It feels more of a game of survival than planning out your best path to victory. Definitely worth a spot in your collection, especially given the wide age ranges that would enjoy playing it.

  We purchased KOT because we want a goood family game with a little luck involved.  Something we could kick out brains out of gear from playing Catan, Pureto Rico or Ticket to Ride, something with luck involved.  So, we ha heard & reviewed KOT and decided this dice game would do the trick.  We love KOT so we bought the power up expansion thinking we would like extra powers (it sounded good).  However, we didn't like it!  It slowed the game down, there was way to much going on....too many cards for us and we didn't like it slowing the game down to figure out what your vards did, because you had so many.

  This game is fun for my family  (5 yr, 10yr kids). We also really enjoy this game on adult game night. I purchased a package of green lighting bolts to use in place of the energy cubes. Do yourself a favor and treat your family and friends to a battle to the death in Tokyo!

KoNY adds significant complexity in the form of the army tokens. I like this game better because it's easier to learn and it doesn't bog down while players decide what to do like KoNY.. It's just ""roll them dice as fast as you can and hope for the best"".

  The penguine score card keeper was broken when we opened the box.

There are several different ways to win so each person can develop their own approach which makes it more complex and fun.

  One of the few games that my players enjoy across the board. I have a picky group, and this is a game that they will almost never say no to.

One of the best games of this century with an artwork update
","

  King of Tokyo is definitely a five star game. For us it has been the better gateway game than Catan because it's faster paced and you can play off-the-cuff turn to turn. This second edition didn't break anything. Really, it's a cosmetic overhaul.If you have King of Tokyo, you're not missing anything gameplay by skipping the second edition. If you don't have King of Tokyo, why aren't you buying this???It's a dice game. I've heard it called Yahtzee with monsters. And yeah, I can see that, but it has a lot more. There is a lot more interaction than Yahtzee with the battle theme. There are heavily unbalanced cards to collect and play, but that just adds to the outlandish gameplay. There's definitely more luck than strategy, but there's a real opportunity to make choices with what luck you're given. In a game of 4 people, you can all four go different ways in trying to win and it's hard to say which strategy will take it all. It's a great group game and is my church youth group's favorite game and I got this second edition to have a copy at our church.As far as the new version goes. I like the old artwork better. All the artwork looks more plasticy. The new board works the same with updated artwork of the same scene. And the Kraken is gone!!! Who in the world decided that a 3-2-1 Penguin poser was better than the mighty Kraken? ""Release the penguin"" in a small squeeky voice is just not the same as a thunderous ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN"". The cyber bunny has been replaced with cyber kitty--who cares. The card back and front artwork is updated (I think the card info is pretty much the same). The dice and energy cubes are the same.The possible problem is the lack of compatibility with expansions. Some of the expansions expect certain characters, and they've said there will be a version 2 Powerup expansion. So don't buy Powerup to go with this yet. The Halloween expansion that few like will not be updated, and the Halloween card backs are not compatible unless you put the cards in sleeves. I own the Halloween expansion but have never taken it out of the box so I can't speak for how much of a loss that is...The rules have been clarified slightly and I understand that the cards are also slightly clarified. But if you have version 1, you can get the rules from iellogames website and use them with version 1!So really if you have version 1, there's no reason to move up unless you have a strange penguin fetish. But if you don't have King of Tokyo--get this game! It's a lot of fun to play with 4-6 people.

  I bought this game for my 15 year old son for his birthday. It was the same price as the video game he wanted, and this was the WAY WAY WAY better choice. He has played it more than once every single day since his birthday, and I’ve even found him sitting around reading the national park cards and planning out where he would like to go someday! The whole family enjoys the game from the 7 year old up. The video instructions were fabulous and made the learning curve of how to’s a snap.The price May seem high for a board game if you are comparing it to the $10 you’d spend to buy sorry or clue, but for an interactive game it is pretty on par with others. And if you consider the other alternatives for your $50 this is a no brained. You can barely take a family of 4 to the movies for that much (let alone a family of 8).We’ve had great fun with this game, and I would definitely recommend buying it!

After Christmas lunch we watched the video, then played in teams, slowly and referring to the instruction book. We helped each other for awhile, but once we understood the rules, it got crazy with competition and booting each other back to start. So much fun! It took about 30 minutes for all generations to catch on. My in-laws are in their 80’s and have been to most of the parks. Everyone enjoyed hearing about their memories.

Kind of like Harry Potter Monopoly
","

  My headline is the best analogy I can offer.  The game itself is OK and has a fair mix of strategy and luck.  Quality of the pieces and documentation is high.  However, despite it's name, it's not a game about the National Parks.  The National Parks  have nothing to do with how you play.  It's also about as informative about the National Parks as reading a post card about them (basically the park cards in the game are a single post card about the park).  So, if you buy this, forget the National Parks aspect and buy it based on the game play alone. I'd be OK with all of this if it were not for the price.  This is a $10 game in terms of it's uniqueness and play that costs 5x that much.  If you've played any of the Ticket to Ride games, you've played this already just like if you've played Monopoly, you've played Harry Potter Monopoly with just different names on the cards, board, and pieces.

  We thought it would be fun and educational , it Midas well be just monopoly with a whole lot more rules and difficult to learn . They are capitalizing on the national parks . we found it to be thumbs down in every category , not even fun - not one teaching moment anywhere

This game surprises me!
","

  To start with, I am an avid board gamer with a big collection of board games. At the same time, I also loves the outdoors. With a friend's recommendation, I picked up this game hoping it will be a good game I can play with my kids. I thought I was just getting a basic simple family game but I was wrong. This game is simple to learn yet offers enough depth even for gamers!This game is well produced with quality components. The cardboard, cards, plastic beads, and wooden tokens are well produced. The game play is very engaging as there are multiple objectives you can choose to go for. The rule can be easily learned within 10 minutes from the rule book, and taught within 5 minutes. The theme is great and is integrated with the game play very well. I love the pictures of the parks on the cards, accompanied with informative text that are very educational for kids and adults alike. Overall, I'm very happy with game and it will stay in my collection of games for sure!

Great Idea but Needs More Development Time
","

  We are an avid game family and love to try new games in hopes that they'll become those family favorites that create memories. We've played this game a dozen or more times now and feel really comfortable with the rules/strategy/that sort of thing and while the concept is great (I mean it is basically a copy of Ticket to Ride but not as good). Every time we play it we are always commenting on how it would be better if this, or it should have been like that, or more of this, or we would have added/deleted/etc. and we've never done that with any other game we've played. So its like it needed more development time to really hone in a set of rules/cards/tokens that makes more sense and would make the game more interesting and exciting. It feels like a lot of different ideas were crammed into one game and a big mess came out. I mean its called trekking and claims to be about national parks but despite the cute game pieces, you don't really get to set up camps as much as you'd like to or use the bear. It isn't the worst game or a bad game, it just could have been much better with a little more thought and definitely not worth the $50. Just buy a ticket to ride.However, if you're looking for a family game and are concerned its for older kids/adults, its NOT 10+, our just 5 year old plays this game without any difficultly and scores just as many points as adults (as does my 9 year old). Also, the 'leather' bag is a waste. It isn't used in the game at all and is just for storage in the box? And while that is 'nice' it doesn't make a ton of sense. But the game board and tokens and cards are all of a good quality, it doesn't feel cheap.I really wanted to love this game though, it just needs something more/else to it....

  I love this game.  I had the pleasure to be able to experience this game from its earliest stages, and it keeps getting better.  This family friendly game is a great combination of educational game for the kids, but still full of enough strategy and different play styles that experienced gamers will enjoy it over and over again.  I actually own an original version, but when I saw that it was getting a new release, I had to buy another copy to give out as a great holiday gift for some game loving friends.  You won’t be sorry with the play, the education factor, or the artwork of this game. Enjoy!

Variety, Mentally Stimulating, Fun!
","

  Pros - The game parts are very well made. They feel nice and sturdy in your hand,  and they are visually pleasing. The board and cards setup pretty fast. Game play moves pretty fairly quick. Victory Points are gathered in several ways and we were surprised by who won the first game. You Camp at  (occupy) some parks for points, collect stones, and buy (acquire) other parks. You have to play a few times to grasp the diversity of total points earned. On the first game we played, I thought I was losing, with only 3 parks acquired, but I ended up winning when all was tallied.  It changed the way everyone played the second game. I'm looking forward to playing more and devising my strategy.Besides being a good, competitive game, it is fun to learn all the National Park names and locations. The game sparked a lot of fun player conversations and interactions. Game play had a mix of quiet, concentration on one's next move and joking, ribbing, helping and misdirecting conversation.Con - The one con I have is that only 5 players max. can play. My game group is 3 couples, 6 players so I am limited to play when I can find a smaller group. Hoping a player expansion will be available in the future?I very much recommend this game, especially if you love to camp and hike and enjoy the National Parks!

  I bought this game as a family gift for Christmas. My 12 year old granddaughter and I played it for the first time this weekend and we really enjoyed it. First, make sure you watch the video before you attempt to play the game. It is very helpful. Second, use the cheat sheets, also very helpful. We didn't read the directions except as things came up like the special gifts that come with each park occupied - make sure you read those in the rule book to fully understand them. We both enjoyed the variety of things you can do in the game and the strategies involved. There was no way to tell who was winning or losing until everything was scored at the end and we enjoyed that. The quality of the game is excellent with a rugged board and sturdy cards and pieces. I would have gladly given this 5 stars except for one glaring issue. The map is incorrect. They should have taken the time to have each state clearly outlined accurately on the map.

Too complicated & doesn't offer a learning opportunity about the National Parks
","

  This game is not at all what it appeared to be and I wish I would have returned this while I still had time.  I'm a trivia buff, especially when it comes to nature, and my mother loves games of any kind.  The biggest disappointment was the lack of information about the National Parks, their ecosystems and the animals that live in them.  I thought this could be a learning experience but instead, it was a HUGE opportunity missed by the people who created the game.  Other reviewers aren't exaggerating how complicated this is and it is in no way suitable for a 10 yr old.  We spent close to an hour trying to understand it before giving up.

  I'm a hobby gamer with a large game collection, but I still love finding games that can be enjoyed by family and friends who aren't into board games as much. This game is a knockout success! It is certainly inspired by Ticket to Ride but is ultimately a very different game that I believe will be easier to learn and get ""good"" at than Ticket to ride for most casual players. The game is beautiful with an extremely high quality board, lovely cards (the park cards are huge!), big chunky wooden player pieces, and even the box is super thick.I am honestly stunned at the reviews who say they couldn't figure the game out. If you want something a little better than Uno or The game of life, this is as easy to learn as you could ask for. The rule book is perfect. It's rare that I have zero questions after reading the rule book just once. Keep in mind this game is now in its second edition which did make the rules easier. Maybe the negative reviews are all referring to the first edition which is no longer available. In any case: wonderful family game with lovely art and components!

  I was hesitant to purchase Trekking because of the price.  I was afraid that it wouldn't be fun.  I was wrong!  We read through the instructions and then watched the video just to solidify our understanding and to tie up any questions we had.  The video made starting a breeze.  I feel like the game is good for both younger kids and older kids.  Younger ones can play straightforward while older ones can be more strategic in how they move, what they are planning, etc.  The game lasted the perfect amount of time.  Overall, I do think the game is pricey and I appreciate the pre-Christmas sale but it's a lot of fun and it's a game that won't just sit on the shelf.  The cards are very pretty.  I love that each park card has an interesting tidbit of information about the park.  I do wish each state would be labeled as that would be a great teaching tool to younger kids.

Read the rules ahead and you'll love it!
","

  I bought this to hype my family up for a national parks road trip we're taking this fall. I have one big piece of advice. Read the rule book in its entirety before playing. It seems a little complicated until you get through the rules and you realize it's not that complicated at all. I read them and my 9 year old daughter read them and we were successfully able to guide our group of 4 kids and 3 adults (adults helping kids) through the game. Everyone loved it. Then the kids went to bed and the adults pulled it back out. A game usually took about 20 minutes for the grown ups. Played 3 more games with my daughter the next day. We really love this game and I don't see it getting old.Our first round we played with children 5, 6, 9, and 9. The nine year olds had NO problems with the rules or the strategy. Obviously it was a bit much for the younger ones, but they weren't about to be left out!! They played with adult partners. I would say that after a round or two with guidance, anyone 8 and over could easily play and enjoy this game. Someone said it was too hard to figure out who the winner is but the 6 year old was able to tally his points without help, so......I was really hesitant to spend this much on a game, but it's definitely a new family favorite, and the board and pieces are of a really nice quality. But it's not a game you should try to ""learn as you go"" like I usually do for new games. Read the rulebook. The video they send you to does NOT adequately explain gameplay.

  I have had my eye on this board game for several months. I was hesitant to buy it because of the price tag. I have never spent $50 on a board game. However, my love of all things national parks won out, and I treated myself. First, let me say that the quality of every piece of the game is extremely high and impressive. The quality of card stock used is very good. The board, itself, is great. The pieces are very good quality. The game was fun to play. I like the fact that it took an hour for us to play (only two of us). I hate a game that ends too quickly. My husband and I went with slightly different strategies. He wanted to gather as many stones as he could from as many parks as he could. I focused more on acquiring the national parks or camping in the parks. In the end, I won by a small number of points. It reminded me ever-so-slightly of monopoly, but in general, I would say this is a unique game. We will definitely bring it to game night with our nieces soon!

Fun once you figure out the rules
","

  Purchased this because we have an interest in visiting as many National Parks as possible once we retire. Hoping this will let us learn about the lesser known parks. It did take us a little bit of time to figure out how to play. The learn to play video was a start but really had to go over the written instructions a few times. Once we had the concept down we just had to start to play and it all came together. Definitely not for children. But the 4 adults who played had it figured out pretty quickly and we had fun playing. On each of the park cards you attempt to ""win"" there are fun facts about the park. Whoever won the card had to read the fun fact to the rest of us.  In the end, we all enjoyed the game and learned about a few more parks. I'm sure the 2nd time we play it will be even more fun. Knocked it down to 4 stars only because it does take a bit to learn all the rules.

  Bought this game for the family for Christmas...we played it probably 6 times in a row because we had such a good time! The game is set up to give you enough time to come back from behind, but not drag on forever. It seems a little complex when you first start, pretty much every game is while you try to learn it, but once you play a turn or two it becomes very basic and easy to fly through the game. There are different strategies involved, but it is isn't complex, so younger ones can enjoy using their own strategies. It took us about 45 minutes to play each game. They really did think of every scenario and the rules make it easy to continue along. There is even a video tutorial to learn how to play. This is a great game for a family, I'm not sure I'd be totally into it if I were playing with a bunch of adult friends, but I couldn't get enough of it with my kids and I love them learning geography and about some of the national parks! This game was definitely a hit and worth every penny.

Great, fun family game that quickly sparks interest in our national parks
","

  We just received the game today and immediately broke it out. Our first impression of this game is that it’s fairly easy to learn, easier to set up, and fun to play for most ages. There is definitely strategy and planning involved but not completely necessary to play. Our 6 year old just moved around collecting stones and, with a little help, managed to get a couple parks. He obviously didn’t win but it was still engaging enough for him to stick around. The rest of us had a lot of fun racing to parks across the U.S. It has already sparked interest in getting out there and seeing the places in person—which makes me love this game even more. The only con is that the kids were a little disappointed in the purpose of the bear. To remedy their disappointment they decided its job was to chase around and torment anyone who got sent back to start.

  This was a good buy.  I played with my 11yo & 8yo.  Once we got the hang of the rules it was surprisingly fun and we were disappointed when I got the last stone, ending the game.  My 11yo said ""aw!  I don't want it to end.).  My 8yo had a harder time grasping the motive but once she did she was very clever.  She started collecting the highest pointed park cards - all the 10 pointers.Also, the board, cards and game pieces are a good quality.  Right off the bat the kids got sticky honey on the board and the toddler splattered smoothie on it too but it wiped right off and didn't pucker the paper or leave any mark.We learned about the different parks, some I had never heard of (Theodore has a park!) and now we want to visit some of them.Well worth the money (which was more than I ever spend on games, even with the prime day deal).  I'm glad I purchased!

  Fantastic game! We bought it for Christmas and our family of 5 has played it 4 times since we opened it yesterday morning. It appeals to all of us, ages 12-52. It was not hard to learn, especially because different aspects of it are somewhat similar to other games we love, like Ticket to Ride and Seven Wonders. It is NOT just like those games, though. It's definitely a unique and fun game in its own right and we think it's an awesome addition to our game collection. This was sold out at our local game store, so I ordered it from Amazon and got the correct 2nd edition, which according to reviews is much improved over the 1st edition. The pieces and cards and board are all nice quality and sure to last for many, many game nights. Very happy with this game! Highly recommended.

  This game was a gift for my fourth grade grandson. It’s his favorite game to play right now.Pros: Beautiful game. Lots of room for strategy. Kind of like chess, you have to think ahead. Points are earned by collecting stones, claiming park cards, occupying one of the major national parks, and collecting the most of the various colors of stones. So, one player may be working to earn points by claiming parks and one may be working to collect points by collecting stones. The parks cards are fun to read! The first game we read every card we collected out loud to each other. There’s a place for everything in the box, and it fits easily. While the game board is not a scale map of the US, (because the proportion of National Parks in the West if greater) it does give a general idea of the location of the parks. The bear playing piece adds to the interest. The parks cards have beautiful, color photos from the parks. I was able to buy a companion book from Bink Ink, Trekking the National Parks, Park Guide Book. The book is fun to read on its own with more beautiful photos. We are already adjusting some of the rules to make the game, and the enjoyment of it, last longer.Cons: The rules were a little confusing initially. The first time we played, we did some things differently, but still had fun. There is video available of how to play, the paper with the video information was located as we were putting the game away. The board is quite large. My 30 inch round coffee table is the usual game spot, and the board overhangs the edges. We added a tv table to hold some of the cards that are layed out.

  Bought it as a family Christmas gift as we travel the National Parks every summer. Super fun!  It took us a little while to grasp all of the ins and outs of the rules, but once we got going, we really enjoyed it. Looking forward to playing it weekly and developing our strategies as a family and cannot wait to travel with it and play it while we are IN a NP!Our one recommendation to the creator would be to tweak your online video on how to play. Make it a tad clearer and use a better narrator (she dragged out every end word, i.e. card was pronounced as 'kerrrrr-rrrrrrrred' which was distracting).Definitely worth the money and a fair price for those of you hemming and hawing over price.

  I ordered this game to have something fun to play as a family during quarantine. If you like Ticket to Ride, you will love this game. Personally, I like this game a lot better! The game is competitive but not cut-throat since you really don't know who is going to win until the end and points are tallied up. The game lasts about 30-45 minutes with three players. My mom and I tend to lose interest in a game if it goes on too long, but this game has lasted the perfect amount of time. The price is a little more than some other games, but you aren't supporting a huge corporation you are supporting the family that created the game! This game has sparked my desire to visit the national parks!

  Being home with everyone during the COVID-19 pandemic means lots of family time.  As a family that loves going to National Parks, this game seemed like a must have during these times.Without a doubt, it delivered on all fronts.  The game is a blast to play, and offers great pictures of the National Parks, and incredible trivia, as well.  Our kids have only been to a handful of the Parks in real life, but this game has easily inspired them to see many more.  We have played this game every night since we got it, and it has yet to feel boring or monotonous.  Such a great game, and hopefully it will inspire others to adventure out into the true treasures of America

  This game takes a little bit of time to figure out how to play, but once you've got it down it's amazingly fun and there's a lot of learning going on! Info on National Parks, the board itself is a US map with parks mapped on it, and the cards have pics and information about each park on them. There are a few different strategies to use to win and move around the board (one reason the learning curve is a bit higher than some games), so there's math and thinking ahead with a plan in mind at hand with this game! This is definitely a giftable game to give to someone who is a Parks fan or travels, and is one that I don't see kids getting bored of very easily.

  Got ours and played it this weekend. It was a lot of fun! Playing it through one time, you’ll figure out the strategy. It helps kids to learn and find interest  in all the national parks. I saw that first hand with my 11 year old son this weekend. We’ve been able to visit several parks over the last year and he wasn’t very enthused. Was more interested in his iPad, but he got excited pulling up cards of the ones we’ve been too and seeing them on the map along with others that we plan on going to. This made it worth the money for me. I was bummed that not all the parks are included too as the ones that we live closest to and have been visiting all our lives weren’t, but they’re still listed on the map and included in the information. They were just too close to other parks to be included on the game board as destinations. Even my brother who is a board game officianado, collects them, and listens to board game pos casts was impressed. We’ll be playing this one for years! Can’t wait for our next road trip to play it while we’re in a national park!

About the only thing you really learn is where all the National Parks are located.  It also was hard to learn how to play!  To top off my irritation, the game was $50!!

  This is a game fuses tow hobby interests perfectly - the great outdoors and board gaming. It's a theme that isn't all that prevalent in modern board gaming, and this one takes concepts of set collection and route building games like Ticket to Ride honestly replaces that game for me.You're collecting colorful stones, taking simple actions on your turn, traveling a map to discard cards and claim territories, and are making engaging decisions each turn. Kids as young as 8 could likely hang with this game, and I've also playing with people in their 20s and 30s who were equally surprised.If you're looking for something beyond Sushi Go, Kingdomino, Dixit, Ticket to Ride, Karuba, or have never heard of those gateway games and are simply starting your collection for the first time, TREKKING THE NATIONAL PARKS is it! If you like this game, try those others I listed, too. However, this is not as complex as Pandemic, Catan, Small World, or Takenoko, so if you are already finding those games too easy or you feel you are graduating past them, TREKKING... might be step sideways.This is game steeped in real world photography, fun facts, and is actually quite educational while also using fresh mechanism form this century. A sturdy production and a must own for families.

  This was not a bad game, but I personally felt it lacked something for my taste. I typically like more strategic games. This is basically a race to each location to collect gems and race to locations with exposed cards to claim that  location with a collection of cards. I know it will satisfy many people and I will play it again with a particular group. I, personally, would have enjoyed a little more strategy. This is pretty light and easy to learn.

  My wife bought me this game for my birthday and it is already one of my favorites in our whole collection of board games. We have played it multiple times now. It only takes about 30-45 min to finish a game, so we always end up playing at least twice in a row.It is super easy to learn the rules, but there are multiple strategies to try to beat your opponent before the game ends, so the game doesn't get boring. You can try different ways to earn points each time you play through. The game has multiple goals to work toward, and the trick is to figure out how to work toward 2 or more goals at the same time. In addition to the fun gameplay it is nice to learn about and discuss the different National Parks. It has inspired us to visit them all some day!The only slightly negative thing about it - which I don't mind, personally - is that the map of the United States is a little squished horizontally. It's a lot of land to fit on a map board, so I can understand why they did it. It only stuck out to me before we played our first game but I don't even think about it anymore because it doesn't affect gameplay and the game is super fun.Final words: Great game, well designed, lots of replay value, excited to try it with more than 2 people in the future. Definitely a good purchase, IMO. I also like to rate a product by deciding whether I would buy it again if my copy got damaged or lost and YES, I would buy Trekker again.

  Trekking the National Parks is a game that surprised me. I'll never need to own another copy of Monopoly or Ticket to Ride again.My favorite part about the game is that it's so easy to learn, but the decision points are so interesting and engaging. As a lifelong gamer that owns 200+ board games, this game has enough meat and potatoes to keep me entertained, but it's also accessible enough that I can share it with anybody.On top of that, the publisher's love for the National Parks really shines through in so many elements of the game. It's great to look at the map and just be reminded of all the amazing places America has to offer, but the other components--from the box to the rules manual--are packed with information, and a very cool personal touch that makes me feel like I'm sharing something with the creator.Can't say enough good things about this game, absolutely worth the spot in my collection!

Good quality, great value and you learn along the way!
","

  We are a board game family and we really enjoyed this game! If you are familiar with Ticket to Ride, you’ll understand this game pretty quickly. Instead of claiming routes, you’re claiming the destinations (National Parks). You can earn “points” in a few other ways as well, but it’s not too complicated.It may seem a bit expensive, but it’s on par with other games of its quality (Like Catan or Ticket to Ride for example). Also, if you consider that you’d easily spend the same amount going out to one meal or one movie, the value for this game you came play over and over again is really good.One warning- If you like traveling and/or doing outdoor activities, you will find yourself wanting to visit all of these places for real! I think this side effect is awesome!

  We’re a family that likes both national parks + ticket to ride, so this was a great addition. Both my mother-in-law & husband got it for Christmas 🤣I’m super impressed by the quality of the game & pieces, although the bear 🐻 is basically pointless.The overall objective is different from ticket to ride & is to get the most victory points; that can happen by claiming parks, occupying (camping) at a park, and collecting the most/second most stoned as you travel around.

Disappointed

  I purchased this as a gift.  I did get a chance to play it but was disappointed in the game overall.  It was not really as educational as I expected.  It seemed to just be a copy cat game of another popular one. I also felt it was overpriced.

  Was looking for something different to do after the excitement if Christmas AM. Debated on this game purchase for several weeks. It went on sale just before the holiday so I grabbed it. Glad I did. My college student and I played it several times before they had to go back to school. Game looks complicated to learn, but it is not. Just remember to use your unique abilities when you earn them! :)Game is well made, pieces and cards of good quality. Each player has a little card as a reference tool so you can remember rules as you play. I think we referenced the cards the first half of playing the first game and that was it. Good game for young and old, and if you want a little learning involved you will really be happy with your purchase.

Great family game!
","

  I bought this game to play with our family over the holidays.  The game is beautifully made with quality pieces.  The instructions were clear and easy to follow.  Some strategy is required to win but it's not a complicated game to play like many of the new games. My adult sons and my parents enjoyed playing and we played often over the holidays.  The only thing we wished is that more people could play at one time.  Five people are the maximum players.  I've read quite a few reviews where people are complaining about the price.  I know many video games are that much or more.You can't take a family of four to the movies without spending over $50.  Plus you don't get to spend the time talking and learning about our great National Parks. I have to say that the quality time with family as well as the high quality of the game makes it worth every penny.

Amazing Game
","

  This game is so much fun! It is on the more expensive side as games go, but it is 100% worth it. There are several different potential paths to victory, so it avoids the problem other games have of a player losing hope of winning but still having to persist to the very end. In that way, it is a very balanced game. Takes a time or two to really learn the mechanisms of play, but after that it's easy and fun. With regard to age levels, our five-year-old can't really play this independently yet (she plays on a team with someone else), but our seven-year-old has the basic idea.

  I bought this game as a gift for my sister-in-law at Christmas.  I knew I would get the chance to play it with her!  The game is beautifully made and has a card with information on each national park.  It's easy to learn and has a lot of different ways to earn points.  I have learned about some parks I had never heard of before.  Our whole family enjoys it very much and we each use a different strategy to try and win.  Great for the kids (11 and up) and grandma loves it too.  It really is fun for the whole family.  Takes about an hour to play after the rules are known.

  We just played this for the first time.  We played with people ages 11-43.  Everyone was able to pick up the idea.  There are enough different ways to earn victory points which means the game should not get old quickly at all.  The art is good and the facts about the park are nice additions.  All pieces fell well made (the board itself is super nice) and it comes with extra stones in case you lose one which is great.  Also helps teach states and geography. The only complaint is that calling one large stack of cards major parks and the other park cards was a little confusing.  The advantages of claiming major parks did not seem that great, but may come in more handy as one develops strategies.

  We enjoyed playing Trekking the National Parks game. The initial setup included a slight learning curve but after playing it the first time setup will be easier. I suggest watching the video instructions on Youtube, it helps you to visually see the game play.  There are written instructions that can be followed as well. As we played the game, we made plans for our next national park visits.  It is fun trying to develop a strategy. Highly recommend this game for those who love Ticket to Ride and the national parks!

Fun Co-Op Deck-Building Game featuring Harry Potter Characters!
","

  Just a quick little spoiler-free review to say my husband and I love to play Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle!I saw it at our local game store and thought it was a gimmick at first -- just another way to make money off a much-loved franchise -- but then I read the back description.  Our favorite tabletop games are co-op (Forbidden Island/Desert, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Mansions of Madness, Time Stories, etc.), and we also enjoy card/deck-building games (Dominion, Legendary games, etc.), plus I love the Harry Potter series (my husband is okay with it), so we took a chance and bought it.  We now play it every night after we come home from work!The gameplay reminds me of Dominion mixed with any Legendary game, but more fun because you play as specific characters -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, and/or Neville -- and battle though seven increasingly difficult ""games"", each representing a book/movie in the series.  Each game has a set of Locations, Dark Arts, Villains, Hogwarts cards, and other components, such as dice or upgraded character cards.  Beat Game 1, then add Game 1 cards to Game 2.  Beat Game 2, then add Game 1 AND 2 cards to Game 3, etc.  This is a 2-4 player game, so for a two-player game, I recommend each person play two characters to get the full experience.  My husband plays Ron and Harry, and I play Hermione and Neville.The basic premise is to work together to protect Locations from Villain Control and defeat all the Villains.  You lose if all Locations fall to Villain Control, but you win if you defeat all Villains.  Dark Arts and Villain abilities will hurt and hinder characters every step of the way, so building a strong deck of Hogwarts cards and playing to your characters abilities is essential.  The first two games are warm-ups, then the real difficulty kicks in on Game 3.  By then, your characters WILL get ""stunned"" (lose all health) at least once per game.  But that doesn't mean the fun is over, you just take penalties and keep on fighting, so you don't have to worry about someone sitting out of the game and waiting for everyone else to win.In terms of production, this game is the highest quality of all of our tabletop games.  Everything is in full color.  Each Game is individually boxed, and each set of Location, Dark Arts, etc. cards inside are sleeved separately to avoid confusion.  All cards are clearly marked by Game number or the character they belong to if they're starting cards.  In addition to the easy-to-understand 14-page instruction book, each Game has it's own little instruction booklet to easily guide players into setting up the next game and refreshing everyone on rules.  The cards are smooth and feature fantastic art from the movies.  All the cardboard tokens and components are sturdy and already cut out (except Game-specific tokens), and there are even cool metal skull tokens and four beautiful, clear Hogwarts House die inside.  The game box itself is sectioned logically for each game component and even leaves extra space if you want to sleeve your Hogwarts cards.I highly recommend this for anyone who likes co-op tabletop games, deck-building games, and/or the Harry Potter series!

They got it right!  Definitely earned an ""O"" on their N.E.W.T.'s!
","

  I hesitated to buy this game because I've been disappointed in Harry Potter games in the past.  They seemed to rely on the HP theme and didn't put enough effort into actual game play.  I'm happy to say that USAopoly and Forrest-Pruzan Creative have knocked it out of the park!  Or ""castle,"" if you want to go there.This is a cooperative deck building game that has 7 Games that build on each other.  Kind of a neat concept.  (I'm not talking about expansions you have to purchase - everything is included in the box.)  You and the other players play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Nevile.  The object is to defeat the villians (Draco, Quirrel, Lucius, etc.) before the villians take over all your locations. That's the object of the first 2 Games, at least.  Because, just like the novels, this game builds on itself 7 times.  Game 1 is complete in and of itself, but adding the material of another Game box will change it in certain ways.  One of the Game boxes add dice...to a deck building game that starts with no dice.  I can't wait to get there!The board, cards, and tokens are all very good quality. Nothing is flimsy or wanting. The Dark Mark tokens are stellar.  Molded in metal, they have a heavy weight and definitely add to the ""wow!"" factor with this game.  After you play each Game box, the cards can be separated out again, or left together by type.  (Game 1 has 2 villians, Game 2 adds 3 more, etc.)  The game developers thought ahead and even gave us organizer cards if you want to keep everything all mixed together (all the villians together, all the Dark Art Events together, etc.) once you've cracked the box and moved up the Game ladder.Because of the Game 1-7 add-on feature, this is an excellent intro to Eurogames.  It starts off really simple but ramps up after you get used to the mechanics.  One of the great perks is that if you have kids just now reading the books, you can play this game with them up to and including the Game box for the corresponding book.  That way it's completely relevant to them and nothing is given away for the later books.Harry Potter is very special to me for personal reasons that go back to 1997.  I was an original fan.  My hat is off to the developers for creating a solid, enjoyable game for diehard fans!

Well produced and thematically-enriched deck building game
","

  *Important notice for people purchasing the early first runs of this game. There was a printing error which lead to 4 copies of a card called Confundus being put into the box (2 in box 5 and 2 in box 6 I think). The two Confundus! cards in box 5 were supposed to be two copies of Stupefy! which are missing from some peoples game, including my own. You can contact USAopoly customer service to get replacement cards:usaopoly.com/game-care-customer-service-inquiryThis is a highly entertaining game that was well worth the purchase and should be enjoyed for some time to come. I've played with just two and multiple games in groups of four and it's entertaining with both.As a quick summary -  I enjoy deck builders and this is a solid addition to our collection. If you like deck builders, particularly co-operative ones like Legendary Encounters: ALIENS, and enjoy Harry Potter this seems like an inevitable purchase. It also works as an easy way to introduce people to deck building mechanics which should work nicely for families, just be wary of small spoilers for children that haven't read through the books yet.For a more detailed breakdown of my thoughts so far:-The game evolves as you play through the chapters/games. The game has a built in tutorial for the first few games where it introduces you to the general mechanics of deck builders and the basics of this particular game. As you progress through each chapter you essentially continue to add more villains, more purchasable cards and more Dark Arts Events. If you're familiar with deck builders or are a savvy bunch you could easily start on game 4 or 5. The cards are all marked for which game they belong to so that if, at any point, you want to reset the game back you can easily do so. Game 7 represents the ultimate full form of the game with the full complement of villains, Dark Arts Events cards and the couple other unique features introduced throughout the entire series including game 7.-The game will get longer as you progress through chapters. You continue to add in villains with each chapter meaning the number of villains that you need to defeat is also increased. People have suggested on Board Game Geek that it plateaus out at about 1.5-1.75 hours with the very first game maybe being half an hour.-It both does and does not follow the events of the books and movies. As you progress through chapters it will introduce villains and Dark Arts Events from the Harry Potter series. However the game doesn't really try to tell a story and most of the villains don't come up in order. As a result it doesn't really give away major pieces of the plot. Regardless if you have a child that is reading through the books currently the best suggestion would be to only play through the games that they have read up to (game 1 matching roughly to book 1) mainly so they can relate to the villains and Events that occur. If you want to play beyond that point you can also look through the cards and maybe just remove those cards that you think might give too much away.-The game tends to be a bit harder with 4 people than with 2. Some of the Events and villains affect all characters simultaneously which makes the game slightly harder for a full group. I think overall it balances well for two players still since you also have less hero powers to make use of. It may not be the most difficult co-operative game out there, but make no mistake, the game can kick your butt pretty well depending on the villain order. You need to carefully balance damage output, heals and removing villain influence.-There is no player elimination. I don't like player elimination, especially for semi-long games. This game handles that aspect nicely, there are still health pools to track for the characters but when you hit zero you aren't eliminated. Instead you discard some cards for that turn and it helps the villains, but you are not eliminated. You bounce back to full health for the next turn. If everyone keeps getting stunned every other turn, however, you will lose. So you still need to be careful-Production quality is quite good. The pieces are all well done. The theme flows through all the cards and pieces. Overall the game mechanics, theme and cards just simply work. Very nice box and board. It feels like the designers are true fan of the series-Several groups of friends already want to play this game just from seeing a picture posted online. It has that excitement factor just looking at the game, which I think is a huge plus.-Setup and game play is quick. You can set up a game in under 10 minutes and get going. Turns tend to be straightforward and are quick to resolve.The game is easy to teach. The rules are easy to understand and everything is basically explained on the cards themselves. This helps immensely with teaching the game and being able to just play rather than making sure you have all the rules just right before each turn. This is a fantastic gateway game since you can modify the difficulty level while still introducing some major designer game concepts (like deck building) to a group. The co-operative nature of the game means you can actually help other players without ruining the game.So should you buy it?If you already own a ton of designer board games (Think like 20+ especially deck builders or maybe cooperative games). You may not get a ton out of this particular game unless you want/need the Harry Potter theme or if the game mechanics are drastically different from anything you already own. I think this game does what it does well, but nothing is especially groundbreaking. For these people that already own a lot of games I'd suggest waiting to see online plays or for reviews to come out from your favorite reviewers before purchasing. Rahdo has a nice run through of this game and Dice Tower has also covered it just to name a coupleFor those that have more limited designer game collections. Are you looking to try out (or think you might like) cooperative board games? Are you looking for a good introduction to deck building games? Do you love the Harry Potter universe or have family members that do? If you answer yes to all of these it's an obvious purchase. If you answer yes to even one it's also probably a great purchase.I bought it because I love cooperative games and there are limited cooperative deckbuilders. For me and my relatively small collection of games it ranks right up there along with my other cooperatives like Pandemic and Ghost Stories in terms of fun. It probably doesn't have the huge replay value of a game like Pandemic, but it also doesn't need to. I'm exceedingly happy with my purchase and the significant other is too, and that's all I really care about.

So this game is pretty fun, but suffers from some balance issues
","

  So this game is pretty fun, but suffers from some balance issues, I think. The game itself is actually divided into 7 different games, which follow the 7 books. Each game you get to play as one of the main characters of the book and all players work together to try and win. You play the games sequentially and the cards and characters follow the books thematically as you progress. Each new game adds new cards and gameplay elements that progressively make it harder and more complex. That part is pretty fun and the pieces are well crafted and fun to look at and handle.We found a couple problems playing through with 2 players - the first 6 games are way too easy. We felt like we were just going through the motions and never actually felt like we were ever in danger of losing. It wasn't that it was a bad game, there just was no tension or threat that you need to make a cooperative game interesting. Once we got to game 7 though, it did feel like it got harder, but honestly we still won with relative ease.So, we suspected that part of the reason the game was so easy was that we only had two players. So when we had the chance, we had a couple friends play with us, using all the pieces for game 6. We got absolutely destroyed, with not even a chance of winning. The problem was that on other player's turns your character can be negatively affected. With only one other player there's not really that big of an impact. With 3 other players you get absolutely destroyed every turn with all the negative things that accumulate. This seems like a huge balance issue in the game to me.Overall if you're looking for a nicely themed game with good production value, I'd say this is a good game for you. If you're more interested in challenging gameplay with sound mechanics, it might take some time to find the right balance, but may be worth the effort.

Best Harry Potter game ever and can hold its own with the majority of deck building games
","

  If you are a deck building expert you may find the game play is not as good as the best deck building games but it is a very good deck building game.  If you are new to deck building games this is a terrific introduction with a seven step system that has a really easy entry point for books 1 and 2.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and even a casual gamer this is a must have.  In terms of implementing the theme of the series it is incredible.  The cooperative nature allows for a group of varying skill levels to enjoy the evening.  We play as a family with a non-gamer wife and gamer boys 8 and 10.  We have played it around 15 times though now we only play it as game 7 with all the bells and whistles.  I took it to my local wargaming club and they enjoyed it. Which is amazing as they hate cooperatives!  The games do often turn into runaway defeats or victories but I believe that is the nature of the designer choices which heavily favor random as opposed to scripted adventures.  There are many house rules you can pick and choose from Boardgamegeek to adjust the difficulty of the game or minimize the chances of a runaway. The game system is solid and so many of the best parts of the book show up it was addictive and bedtime was banished for a couple of weeks.  I really love that you add a little each game.  Very much a christmas morning feeling opening games 3 through 7. We paid about 40 bucks. One of the best gaming values in my 35 years of gaming. If you have any interest in designing a game for your favorite subject there are great lessons to be learned here.  I can't believe this was produced by a relatively unknown company, they punched way above their weight.

A suprisingly fun game, even for adults.
","

  This game is a deck builder that uses an ""Ascension-style"" card market (where the cards change every time one is bought), rather than a ""Dominion-style"" market (where the cards market is determined at the beginning of the game and doesn't change). If you're familiar with just about any deck builders, you'll be able to pick up on this game pretty easily. You start the setup by picking a character (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville), each of which has a unique starting deck, and opening the small box that contains the cards for the game you are about to play.This game plays out in 7 ""books"", each of which are contained in their own card box within the big box. Each book is a single game. When you successfully complete a game by defeating whatever villains come with that book, you can open the next card box which slightly changes the game by 1.) adding or changing the villains, 2.) adding or changing the environments, 3.) adding to the types of bad events that can occur, 4.) adding more complex cards to the market, and 5.) changing the powers of the characters.The game isn't strictly a legacy game in that you mark up the board or rip up cards, but it does build upon itself from game to game. However, when you complete a book (which takes less than an hour, early games are less than 30 minutes), you can pack up the game for another time, or continue with the scenario right away. This makes the game perfect for squeezing in one quick scenario before bedtime without committing to 2 hours of play. It's easy to play previous scenarios again, if you so desire.As far as collaboration goes, the game is cooperative, but the actual collaboration is limited to helping a fellow player heal (you WILL take damage in this game from the bad guys) or helping them get a little extra money to buy cards on their turn, but these are mostly rare events, and only if you draw the correct card on your turn. Otherwise, most of the collaboration is in the form of table-talk. I wish it had a bit more interaction, but that would have complicated the otherwise simple and fun mechanics.

","

  This is a really well-designed game that should appeal to players young and old. My wife and I prefer cooperative games and this has quickly become a favorite. The game system works really well and is easy to understand with game mechanics introduced over the series of 7 years that you play. You will encounter all of your favorite characters and items during the game and quickly come to hate the villains even more (you'll shudder when Bellatrix LeStrange or Fenrir Grayback appear. Not because they are evil, but because they are so difficult from a game mechanic basis).The game proceeds through 7 years each one a slightly more complex game. An important detail to note is that there is no continuity from game to game. You don't retain any abilities won from one year to the next. This is probably the thing most of our friends have commented on while playing.The game also does suffer a tiny bit from two problems. The wrong deal of starting villains can be impossible to beat and the only choice is to lose and start over. The second problem is that you build abilities by buying cards from a market. The market deal is random and it may start out as too expensive for anyone to buy anything and doom the players (there's even a creator suggested alternate rule to deal with this). However, these are minor problems in a great game (though we are busily working on house rules to introduce a way for players to hang on to improved abilities from game to game).The final point that I will mention is the actual cards and game pieces. They are a weird mix of extremely high-quality and junk. The ""stones"" are very nice metal pieces and the board is really well made. Other pieces share this quality. However, the ""galleon"" markers are junk and look really cheap (I'm searching for good quality galleons to buy right now to replace them). The biggest offender is the cards themselves. We've played through the game 3-4 full cycles (so that's 20-30 games) and the cards started to show serious wear on the edges during the first cycle of games. The printing is coming off the edges of most all of them. It's the most disappointing thing about the set.We would still recommend this to anyone who likes cooperative games (Harry Potter fan or not). It's very enjoyable and very replayable. It's a must buy.

  This looks like a fun game, but unfortunately, the first set of game cards (to play the first game) did not come with the set.

Surprisingly Solid Licensed Game: Great for Novices and Experts, Especially Harry Potter Fans
","

  Bought this for my fiancee, as she's a huge Harry Potter fan, but not nearly as much into board games as I am, and I thought the co-operative, increasing difficulty might be a good hook for her.I was right. The game slowly eases into its rhythm, with seven different modules, each of which introduces new villains and attacks, as well as new spells with which to fend them off. There are new mechanics, too, with each of the four main heroes (Ron, Harry, Hermoine, Neville) ""growing up"" and getting personalized abilities in Game Three, and then learning proficiencies from their O.W.L. exams as of Game Six. Voldemort starts showing up as a rival around Game Five, and the number of villains and Dark Arts to contend with at once keeps increasing.Throughout all of this, the production design is outstanding, from the way the instruction booklet has slots to accommodate the ""new"" rules for each new ""year"" (game), to the actual tokens, from the ones that mark petrified foes and the weighty iron baubles that show how much of a locale enemies control. Movie fans will also appreciate that the familiar likenesses of these characters have been used for the art.The one issue I have with all of this, and where I have to dock a point, is with regards to the balancing of the game. It's meant for two to four players, but doesn't really scale: some of the cards and proficiencies that have effects applying to all characters seem underwhelming in a two-player game, and some of the enemy attacks are too powerful in a four-player game, in which you may constantly get stunned before getting a chance to take a turn. Randomness is a point of games like these, but certain enemy combinations are particularly frustrating (say, dealing with Lucius's ability to heal each time a location is attacked along with Pettigrew's odds of hitting a location). Moreover, with only six cards visible at once, all of which may be maddeningly out or your price range, you simply might not be able to ever mount a plausible defense. The game is largely nail-biting when it works, which is good, but you might need to add a few mulligan-like house rules of your own to keep things playable, especially with younger children.All in all, though, there's at least twenty hours of replay value in this box, and kudos to the developers for making it so easy to pack back up, with individual slots for the dice and dividers for each of the different types of cards. And while the deck building might be a bit frustrating (there's no way to get rid of outdated cards so as to streamline your deck for the endgame), and the meta-game might be a little cheap (leave the least harmful enemies in play all the way to the end), it's a great primer for newcomers, and a terrific opportunity for experts to share their passions in an enjoyable Harry Potter environment.

Solid, well-designed game which hits its target (Harry Potter fans that like teamwork and strategic deck building)
","

  This addition to my board game collection was with lower expectations, but it leaped over all of them and is a keeper.  However, I can see where there are limitations to its appeal.PROS:  solid introduction to deck building mechanic, approachable game for young players, good connection for spells and items, strategy and planning make a difference, cooperative (very important in my family!), a sense of progression through the years as the character cards get older and get a special ability, good Harry Potter world ""feel""CONS:  mediocre card quality (sleeves needed if seeing more play time than one playthrough/year), limited key characters (only Ron, Hermoine, Harry and Neville) and my daughter would have liked to have the option of other houses, slow start each year as people build their decks (would be nice to provide a ""carryover"" spell from a previous year, especially if you do very well), villains repeat from year to year, and some downtime between turns especially with more than 2 players.While I'm not a board game fanatic, I am definitely a board game player with an affinity toward games with strategy and theme--Lord of the Rings Living Card Game (sleeves fit this game) is what dragged me kicking and screaming into the hobby.  I have experience building decks, so this was an easy learn.  I would have skipped years 1 and 2 but it was my daughter's first time playing a deck builder.  She picked it up quickly and loved the game (I would rate her a 4 out of 5 Harry Potter fan).Overall, this is a must buy if you are into medium weight board games (or like deck builders) and a Harry Potter fan.  If they have expansions (with other heroes from other houses), I would buy them.  However, if you already have a good deck building game, this will NOT oust it unless you like the cooperative bent or the theme.

Soooo much fun for our whole family
","

  I was nervous at first about this game because I thought it was just another gimmick to make money under the Harry Potter franchise, but no, it is one of the most well thought out games we’ve ever played.  It says for ages 11+, but my almost 8 year old has no trouble keeping up.From start to finish the game is so packed with awesome details and quality game pieces.  We play it almost every night.  My husband is not a big Harry Potter fan like me, but he really likes the game.  And my son would rather play this than watch tv or play his video games, so it HAS to be pretty interesting.I’m already in the process of ordering the expansion.  Honestly, I can’t say enough good things about this game, it is truly great.And FYI, I wasn’t paid or compensated for this review.  I’m just a mom who wanted a new board game for our little family to play other than the typical board games out there.  This one delivers.

I liked the price
","

  I bought this game as a Christmas gift for my family because my boys grew up reading and loving Harry Potter.  I liked the price, and I liked the reviews.  I cannot begin to tell you how much we enjoy playing this game together!  I had never played a deck building game before, but now I'm hooked.  There are various game levels that become increasingly difficult to defeat.  The more we play, the better we become and developing a strategy for each player.  We work well together and have even developed a strategy for the types of cards each player should try to add to his/her deck.  Every time we play, we have a different experience.  Although my kids are older (22 and 25), I think kids as young as 10-12 could easily play this game once they understand the rules of play.I was not much of a game board player before we found this game.  Since then, we have been steadily adding games to our collection.  This game remains one of our very favorites to play.

First real venture into co op board games.
","

  Huge Harry Potter fan so seeing this pop up peaked my interest. I watched some videos and learned about the world of co op board games. Honestly my whole life board games to me were monopoly or trouble. So this has introduced me to a new aspect I never knew about. Everything is beautiful made and the game is fairly well put together. It has a progressive learning curve so you’re not thrust into a ton of rules from the get go. It’s kind of a learn as you go. The only complaint I have is I really wish this wasn’t the movie art and could have been the book art but alas it is what it is. If it was this would have been six stars for me. I really like how it’s set up into seven games and the way it all works you can kinda pick up wherever. Unless you’re going long haul you probably won’t do all seven in one go. So there’s a lot of playtime here. Overall highly recommend.Little update to the review:After quite a few times playing. We have realized a few things. First off the game is not perfect. If your starting villains have a effects that happen to trigger each other you have to stop and reshuffle. Second if your starting buy cards are all either expensive or not useful for starting game you have to reshuffle and start over. Third is you first few darkarts events cause you to lose the first location before beating any villains. Again reshuffle. It is absolutely impossible to win the game if your initial setup is triggering and your losing health and gaining locations tokens fast. That’s about the only “problem” we’ve come to find. It’s a matter of recognizing quickly that “yea we’re screwed” before trying to progress. Trust me you’ll just waste 40 mins of the inevitable. But if you get a good setup to start, then the game is great. It’ll have a bunch of ups and downs and stressful moments. You still will lose but at least you had a shot.One thing my wife and I have also learned is that Harry is easily the worst of the four. If you’re not playing 4 players don’t use him. The others effects are much better. Also while this makes the game take much longer we have found that if you use hermione to buy up a bunch of location token removals and give her the added effect to remove locations you can pretty much win every game. This strategy worked great in game 7. Again though this is the slower route but has a higher success.Overall after playing this a bunch of times now through each game, it has its flaws. It’s not a perfect strategy game as the randomness of the event cards easily upends that. But it’s alot of fun. You’ll probably lose half the games you play but it makes the ones you win that much better.

Excellent deck-building Co-Op - a few minor nuisances though
","

  This game is a wonderful deck-building co-op game!Pros:- There are 4 character cards and enough proficiency cards that will randomize the game and add a level of difficulty.- Due to the shuffling of villain/dark arts cards, it's a different battle each game you play- The game builds on itself - great for beginner players to start on lower levels and work up to 7.  For those that understand deck-building, it was fun to go from 4-7.- Great balance between Villain effects and the reward for defeating a Villain.- Decent replay value - I've played 30 times and it's still fun as long as you randomize your starter character/proficiency cards.Cons:- The rule book doesn't cover some common questions:  Q: If you have a Weasley Hero card and another person is playing as Ron, does his starter deck count as having a 'Weasley'?  Q: If you play a card from you 5-card hand and it goes into the 'discard pile', and you get to pick a card from your discard, can you pick what you have played that turn?  Q: Does the Death Eater affect you as he initially comes out and/or does he affect you if he's the first Villain and two others come out?  Q: Are you allowed to discard a card in your hand in order to avoid the effects of horcruxes/Villains (eg: You have an Ally and the horcrux says that if you ""play an Ally..."")- You're hamstringed on 3 critical components of the game:  1. ***If the 6 starting (and subsequent) cards that come out for purchase don't contain 'remove from location', are too expensive (6/7/8 coins), or don't have 'dice-rolls', you can be off to a rough start. ***EDIT - the game developer released an optional rule starting that: ""Once per game, a player may forego acquiring any cards for his or her turn. If he or she does, take ALL SIX available HOGWARTS cards, and place them on the bottom of the deck, replacing them with six new cards"". This rule applies collectively to all players. So any one player can do this action ONCE per game. if a player chooses this option, no one else can repeat it until the next game""***  2. If the 3 Villains that come out initially work off of each other (can't gain heart, lose 2 heart, and if you add to location, lose 2 heart) you can be off to a horrid start.  3. Dice rolls - if you don't like relying on dice rolls, you'll need to in the later 'levels'.  If any of these happen to you, there's a great chance you'll lose.  In the games' defense, losing a co-op game is part of the fun/challenge.  Additionally, if any of these happen, the 1-hour game could turn into 3-hours.I know it looks like a laundry list of complaints, but very fun game and I'm looking forward to the expansion in August 2017.

Perfect for board game fans & Harry Potter fans
","

  My family plays a lot of board games and we are all Harry Potter fans, especially my daughter.  Once I began my search for a Harry Potter-themed game I came across all the usual franchise-money-grabs.  Just as I was losing hope I came across this game.  The reviews sold it for me.  This game is amazing; it’s not just some quickly made game to turn a buck or a previously released game wrapped in Harry Potter robes.  It’s a legit good game.  The game is difficult enough to keep us on the edge thinking we will lose but the tide always turns by the end.It is a co-op game where the players work together to defend Hogwarts against the Dark Arts using a clever drafting system.  The first time we only played Game 1.  I thought it was too simple and was having second thoughts on my purchase but I was happy my daughter liked the game.  The next night we played, we only stopped because it was getting too late.  The genius of the game is how each ‘level’ or Game increases in difficulty and complexity.  New cards (spells, items, and allies), villains, and locations are introduced as well as new elements like dice and upgraded characters.The box is designed to hold the cards in an organized fashion after each box has been open.  To play through a previous level/game all you have to do is a little sorting.  Since I have played it mostly with my daughter we have gone back to play the other levels with the rest of the family.My only complaint is I wish there were more characters to choose from.  In this game, you choose between Harry, Ron, Herminie, and Neville.  The expansion includes Luna so I’ll be picking that up.I haven’t tried yet but I think this game would be fun played solo as well.

Obsessed With This Game
","

  I have an obsession with this game. I am a big fan of strategy board games, and this is probably my favorite right now. When I want to introduce it to my other nerdy board-gaming friends, I describe it as a mix of Pandemic and Dominion.Pros:-Cooperative (everyone wins or everyone loses)-Has different levels and ways to make it more or less challenging. My husband and I play it together, or with friends on the harder levels. We play it with our kids (ages 8 and 6) on the easier levels.-My emerging reader can even play it to some extent because it is cooperative. He has his cards out on display, and we can tell him what to do. This doesn't work as well with games where we are competing. It works great for a cooperative game.-There are so many variations on each game, depending on which villains you play against first, which cards are available to build your deck with, etc.Cons:-Instructions are not incredibly detailed, so there are a lot of things that we just have to just make our own house-rules about.-Setting it up and putting it away can be time-consuming because there are so many parts.-It takes a while to learn to play it well enough to do so quickly. It is not a game I teach to many friends because the learning-curve is a fairly steep one.

SUCH a GREAT game!!!
","

  I had been looking at this game for a while, but I wasn't sure if it would be very fun or have high replay value. I had doubts if a game that was so steeped in branding could be worthwhile. We own a LOT of board games, and enjoy a large variety (Catan, Clank, Ticket to Ride, Kingsburg, Above and Below, Galaxy Trucker, Killer Bunnies, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Terra Mystica, Dominion, etc), so we have a pretty high standard for what is fun. I read lots of reviews, watched a play-through, and still couldn't decide. I ended up getting it for Mother's Day (#SayNoToFlowers), and it has been SO fun!! I played through the whole thing (plus the expansion) with my husband, and we love it!!! This is a pretty straight-forward deck-builder, but with the added geekiness of Harry Potter!! It has seven boxes inside containing cards and other pieces for at least seven separate games, and *accurately follows the seven Harry Potter books, while using photos from the movies (*exceptions include a villain card of Malfoy in the first box that shows Malfoy much older than in the first movie- there are a few cards like that). The game adds elements that make sense which each new box, the characters you use improve, and it's gets harder to beat the game. I love cooperative play and deck building and HARRY POTTER so this game is a no-brainer favorite for me! The added bonus is that my husband likes it just as much (he said it's better than Marvel Legendary) so we will be playing it often!! (Unlike Clue...*sniff*) We both have favorite characters to be (him: Neville; me: Ron) Some of the levels took multiple times to beat. It's a great two or three player game (we haven't played with four people). The other great thing is that my nine year old can play with me (only through the books she has read, because there are some spoilers) and it was easy for her to learn. Now that we have opened every box, there are some suggested ways to mix up the game, as well as ways to make it harder, if you want, so there is infinite value in replay! Oh, and the game includes a system to sort the cards as well as space to keep them all organized in the box! GREAT game!!!

Fantastic game and excellent customer service
","

  My husband and I love this game.  It's engaging and practically begs to be played.  We have lost a couple times, but that hasn't been a deterrent to playing.  The game play is simple in the first games and gradually adds on more complicated elements as you advance.  This is nice in that, not only does it follow the idea of you gaining in wizardry power through the years, but also it makes the game easy to learn.  I like that I can find a youtube video on how to play a game if I have trouble following the rule book, but it's nice that I didn't have to do that with this game.  The instructions were well-explained and the game is set up in a way that didn't make me feel like I needed to revisit calculus.  Basically, it's a good game without seeming unnecessarily complicated.After we played game 4, I realized that our game 5 Dark Events cards were missing.  I shot an email to the company and received an envelope in the mail with the missing cards just four days later, with a bonus card included as an apology.  Any company that will assist their customers so quickly is one I want to buy from again.

Lots of fun, some complexity, game made mostly of great quality materials.
","

  So far we've only played 2 of the 7 games included (each game includes extra cards, mostly to be mixed with the cards of the previous game), but this has already been great fun. I feel like setup (especially first-time) is a little tedious and the cards come in an insane number of small bags (this is to help you sort them for the first game at least, so, don't do what I did and just shuffle them all together or you'll have to sort them out by hand). There are probably 10 different subsets of cards (they are all labeled, just takes a bit of getting used to).Once you get rolling, the gameplay is fairly quick. You'll probably want to play more than one round, though, so you can take advantage of being already set up. Being a co-op game it's great for kids, everybody gets to be on the same side and the ""forces of darkness"" are symbolized by a few villain character-cards and some nasty spell cards.So far the game seems very true to the movies (no spoilers). My daughter is very into the lore and pointed out that, even though there are 7 games (supposedly following the 7 books) some characters who don't make it through the first book will still be in play in game 2. She also noticed that some of the photos for the game 2 cards are taken from later movies. This didn't harm the gameplay at all, and didn't upset her much, just required a tad more suspension of disbelief.The bad guys damage the heroes and take over locations (cards with nice screengrabs from the movies) through spells that they cast each turn (also cards with movie-quality pictures). The heroes (the 2-4 players) play Harry, Hermione, Ron, or Neville. Players track health using cardboard tokens on a track, and the villains track their control of the locations using small but fairly hefty metal tokens. Players build abilities by purchasing spell and item cards with cardboard ""influence"" tokens.Almost all the characters from the movies are in the game, all as photos of the original actors, so, everyone can be righteously on guard when, say, Lucius Malfoy's card turns up, or happy when Trevor or Crookshanks dispatches a foe. Another big part of the fun is imagining yourself casting spells. There are lots of fun ones (although, for some reason, the game is chock full of comparatively unexciting Alohomora (unlocking) spells). If you or your kids aren't into the books or movies, then the game will seem less fun. Also, the villains use the same ""dark mark"" skull symbols as shown in the movie and a certain dude-who-must-not-be-named is pictured in full bad-guy makeup, so if your kids are young enough to be scared by that, you might want to wait on getting this game. (For that matter, the metal tokens are easy to swallow and the game is all about magic spells (some of which wound characters, though there are no graphics of this), so there are plenty of reasons to keep young kids at a safe distance.)The look and feel of all the cards is great. I wish the tokens were all metal, stone, or a nice plastic, and I wish the few which are metal were of a more interesting shape, but those are very minor gripes. All-in-all, its a great game for game night with your Harry Potter fans.

  So addicting! It takes a round or 2 to really understand how to play but then it becomes hard to quit and put it away! We bought this for our 9 yo son. He loves it but my husband and I are totally hooked, too. While most enjoyable for Potter fans, you don't need any knowledge about the series to play this. We love the cooperative aspect of it. Win as a team or go down as a team. Take note that it is not a quick game to get through. For example, one round of Game 6 with 2 players took 2 hours. Our son has a hard time staying on task and remaining focused but this is not a problem for him while we play!There are some instances when we are unsure of a rule in a specific situation and cannot find an answer in any of rule books. Ie: Can we place the Petrificus Totalus spell on Voldemort when he is not the only remaining villain? We just improvise and end up creating our own (moderately challenging) rule to continue play.

Fantastic game! Fun to learn and to play!
","

  This is an AMAZING game. I loved it from the first time I played it, and have since introduced 7 more people to it, some of whom have even bought it themselves since then. :) It's easy to learn, easy to follow, and fun to play. I highly recommend it to any tabletop gamer who is even just a casual Harry Potter fan.That said, my Year 3 cards are a mess. Seven of them were misprinted (some even on the wrong size card stock) and/or mis-cut. As for the character cards (which contain information absolutely crucial to game play): The cards were mis-printed so badly that the information on them is undecipherable, leaving the cards - and therefore this and future Years of the game - unplayable. We were about to start Year 3 and had to stop because we cannot read the character cards.(Year 7 is fine except for the cardboard tokens, which aren't printed well for where the machine stamps the cut lines. It's fine, the tokens are just a little mangled. Totally playable though. No serious issue, just want the manufacturer to be aware so they can adjust their settings.)I'm still giving this game a 5-star review because it's great - for play, appearance, price, timeliness of shipping, etc. - and I'm assuming the messed up cards are an anomaly. But I will definitely be pursuing Year 3 replacement cards because what I was sold leaves the game unplayable beyond year 2 out of 7. I'll update with the seller's resolution.

Great game to play casually with friends or family
","

  This game is just amazing; it's easily in the top 3 for our household.  It's so exceptionally well designed, weaving the theme of Harry Potter into the gameplay.  It would have been easy for the designers to just make a generic card game and slap Harry Potter graphics and text on it.  But they actually put a lot of effort into designing the abilities, play, etc around the Harry Potter theme.To give a great example: Crabbe and Goyle.  They're a Villain in this game which are easy to deal with and don't do much damage to you.  My family and I developed a strategy where we would just leave them around on the board as long as possible, since they were so weak and easy to play around.  Eventually we realized ... that's exactly why Crabbe and Goyle are in all the movies/books!  They provide a ""villain"" in the stories without being an actual threat.  Very funny.  But that kind of weaving of how characters play in the game is presenting in the design of all the cards.The game is easy to learn and play, so it's great for families and friends who don't have the patience for more ""hardcore"" board games.  Some of the people we play with are down with hardcore games, but not everyone is, which often makes it hard to have larger gaming get togethers.  This game is perfect because anyone can pick it up and have fun with it, but it isn't so easy that it isn't interesting to play.  It still requires thinking, strategy, and working together.  You just don't have to deal with a novel's worth of complex rules.To top it all off, it's a coop game, so no one feels like they're losing.It's basically the perfect game for groups.I really hope the makers of this game apply their skills to other movies/books!

Fun fanciful game, and you can speed it up easily if needed
","

  We are playing with one younger child and finding the games super charming and fun but they go on too long. To fix this we start in about 2/3 of the way into the game (we are on game 3). So we use it the last location, 4 villains, and randomly add 5 or more Hogwarts cards to each hand. This also allows more use of the special fun cards by all players (like Dumbledore might show up) and allows the heroes even footing even if you end up with the hardest villains first. Most importantly we can finish before bedtime and it's just as fun. Just an idea if you are having the same problem!As an update, both boys love this game so much, it's definitely the most time they spend nicely together during this shelter in place. We don't bother shortening the game anymore because it's a staple on the table 🤣. Now they are still starting with a few extra cards from the previous game but they also made up new villains to add. Even the one that can barely read is writing up a storm. If your family likes the books, don't hesitate!

Addictive fun whether you’re a witch, squib, or muggle (or not even a fan of the series)
","

  The solid mechanics of this game make it engaging, complex, and almost as much fun to lose as to win. If you enjoy the books or movies it has a bit of extra fun, but no knowlege of the Potter series is required to become an effective player. I have played with kids as young as seven, but they are too young to really get deep strategy; to survive later levels, play after the young ones are sent to bed.  The game now appears on my “buy it again” list as a repeat purchase candidate because after playing it together I have purchased three more copies as gifts for friends.The game itself is well designed and offers increasing difficulty even for veteran players.  It is broken up into seven “games” that align with the books, and it is intended that you successfully complete the earlier games/levels before moving on to the next.  Since it is entirely possible you may need more than one attempt to get through a game, I want to issue a warning that a gaming session intended to end at 9 PM will quickly turn into parents realizing the roar of victory needs to be muted because it’s 1:30 AM.The cards have a mix of original artwork - including some inspired by characters or locations as rendered in the films - and photos of objects and actors as they appeared for movie fans.  One of the more frustrating aspects to me is that some of the most frequently used and shuffled cards are an uncommonly sized square for which I cannot find protective sleeves!The flow of the game generally goes like this: the bad guys are attempting to take over Hogwarts and if they succeed the good guys - you - are cooked.  Each player chooses a main character and receives a basic set of abilities, spells, items, and a helpful ally.  Players use these cards to gain power for attacks, restore health for themselves or other players, or influence to gain new spells, items, and allies.Of course, the game has to give the bad guys a chance, and it’s a better chance than you as players have of winning. Each player turn one or more dark arts events takes place that weakens characters, limits play options for the turn, or deals damage to the characters.  Whatever villain(s) is/are in play then have an opportunity to deal damage, weaken the characters, or otherwise increase the threat level.  You may have noticed the “villain(s)” comment.  As the game levels get higher or as the threat level increases - like when there are three locations at which you are expected to battle dark forces and they’ve managed to take over two already - each player turn may require up to three dark arts events and your group may simultaneously be facing four villains, one of which is Voldemort himself!  Expect to play some levels multiple times.Play is easy to learn and individual turns can go quickly, but strategic coordination of turns (eg: “I’m going to leave Molly in case Neville can get six influence on his turn and I’m leaving the spells for Hermione, but I’m snagging Mad Eye to maximize my polyjuice potion next turn...”) can take a while to weigh out the options and can make all the difference.I cannot recommend this game more, and have yet to find a person who doesn’t play it and want a copy before the night is over.  Do yourself a favor and pick up your own set.

  Where do I even start?! This game is absolutely amazing! It is challenging, fun, suspenseful, sometimes frustrating, and all-around magical! It brings out our inner-geeks every time. This is the first cooperative board game we have played, but we love that we are working together and helping each other out for one common goal rather than each of us trying to win individually. Visually, the game is beautifully made. There are a lot of pieces to this game, but they are all well-made and store conveniently and compactly in the box. The directions are a little unclear at first, but once you start playing you figure it out pretty quickly. There are endless variations to the outcomes of each round, depending on how many people are playing, which characters you play, and the order of the way the cards are drawn and played. It definitely takes skill and strategy that you have to learn along the way. Once we start playing a round we are hooked for hours, because we just have to beat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named! I have told many friends who love Harry Potter about this game, and their families have all gotten as hooked on this game as we have!

  My husband, friends, anyone who I introduce this game to typically becomes addicted to it pretty quick. Even if you're not  a massive Harry Potter fan, the game-play is really fun. The first few levels are pretty easy to allow you the time to pick up how to play and then it builds quickly into a really challenging game. And even after several play throughs, we still will occasionally lose as its never the same game twice. Really good fun and quite easy to learn and set up.

Has some mechanical flaws, but still lots of fun
","

  I'm a big fan of cooperative games and deck-building games, and this may be my current favorite in the intersection of those two (I also really like Marvel Legendary, but the setup/takedown time on that is a barrier to getting it to the table, while this gets out of the box pretty quickly). I've already played through all 7 games several times, once as a group of 3 and twice as a group of 4 (with another play in progress), and everyone I've played it with has loved it. The Harry Potter theme is admittedly a big part of the appeal, so someone who isn't into the theme won't get as much out of it, but the game itself holds up well enough that it doesn't require everyone to be a big Potter fan to enjoy the game.There are a few mechanical problems to be aware of. My biggest complaint (and it's a big one) is that, especially once the introductory games are out of the way, the game ultimately comes down to location control cards (ones that remove control tokens from the location) -- getting a bunch of those early trivializes the game (as long as you're able to keep removing tokens quickly, nothing else really matters, and it becomes very easy to finish the game on location 1 with few or no tokens), and having no location control cards available early tends to doom you. The result is that most games are either runaway victories or crushing defeats (with the likelihood of these two outcomes depending on what year is being played), with relatively few close/tense games. Another problem (which sounds like it may be addressed to some extent in the expansion, which I have not played) is that there is no way to remove cards from your deck (a standard feature of virtually all deckbuilders), which combined with a fair number of underpowered cards available for purchase can lead the 6 purchase slots to become clogged up with useless cards unless someone buys cards they don't want (and weakens their deck in doing so) just to get them out of the way and allow new cards to come out.With that in mind, the game is a great deal of fun, and I highly recommend it to Harry Potter fans in particular (but not exclusively). This game does a better job than any other that I have seen in making every character seem essential because of their unique abilities -- that differentiation goes a long way toward making everyone feel useful, which is great in a cooperative game.

Disappointed
","

  Best thing about the game is that it's a Harry Potter product.  Everything else is a let down.Several of the cards had super differently colored backs, which lets you know what cards are coming up next on your deck. Pretty disappointing to accidentally know what you're about to draw.  Looks like just really poorly done printing and no real QC?I only played through all of the games once and several of the cards are already torn and damaged even though we've been very careful with them, so they're pretty low quality.The board itself has several folds in the decal that's adhered to the top of it, so it's not smooth and cards get stuck randomly.  It doesn't look very nice, just looks like it was done cheaply in a hurry.As for the game-play itself, it can be frustrating.  Once you get into later games, it's way too easy for your first 2 or 3 villains to be really overpowered compared to the cards you have available at the start, and it's way too easy once you get to the end for the fights to become pretty trivial.  It feels as much like a game of luck as one of skill, which can be fun, but not really what I was looking for.Essentially, it gets 2 stars just for being Harry Potter, so if you're a super fan of the series, you may enjoy it just off of that.  Otherwise, it's just a poorly put together game with really low quality manufacturing and non-existent quality control.  Wouldn't buy again and wouldn't recommend.

Everyone who played it put it on their wish list when they got home
","

  So. Fun. I brought it to an extended-family-get-together and everyone who played it put it on their Christmas wish list when they got home. Even the players who had never read or watched anything Potter-related enjoyed it. It has seven games of increasing difficulty (of course, you don't play all seven in one go!), so it will keep you occupied for a good long time. Great replay value, too, as different cards and abilities will appear in a different order each time. I think it will remain my favorite game for the next decade! I figured out how to play it solo, too (for when I just HAVE to play another round, but am home alone); I just play two of the characters (Ron, Hermione, Neville or Harry). One is supposed to play it with two to four players. It now has an expansion game (The Monster Box of Monsters) that adds Luna Lovegood as a possible player (though even with the expansion pack, this remains a four player max. game). Hogwarts Battle is a cooperative deck-building game that my brother compared to Pandemic (never played that one), so if you like Pandemic, you will most likely enjoy Hogwarts Battle.

Super fun! Initially easy, but much more challenging later!

  Read the reviews, and let me say, they do not do this game justice. Found it to be extremely entertaining. Really is cooperative and initial rule set is easy enough for my 7 year old to keep up.Premise is up to four players cooperate to defeat dark wizards through seven successively difficult encounters. Each player assumes the role of one of the main characters in this quest. Each stage adds additional adversaries, player cards, character upgrades, and story locations which generally add to the preceding stage's scenario cards. For instance, players face three adversaries in the first round. The second round adds three additional adversaries, bringing the total adversary count to six adversaries to beat to complete round two. By the last round (seven), the players will face a total of 20 adversaries and be required to destroy 4 horocruxes in order to beat the game.The instruction book clearly presents game mechanics and all game pieces are high quality card stock which should last for years if taken care of. The only complaint is that the item shipped with a label applied directly to the cellophane vice in a package. It arrived with the wrapping and box damaged somewhat, but all the pieces were present and undamaged, so I wasn't too upset.Can't recommend this game enough. Highly recommended!

  Love this game! If you are a Harry Potter fan, I highly recommend. If you thoroughly read the instructions, it's very easy to learn. My husband and I have not yet finished the game although we've played through the last level ( just haven't ""beat"" the last year of game play) the details of the game are thoughtful and it's really fun. I will say that neither of us are game players typically. I think the last board game we purchased was monopoly. So, again you don't have to be an expert game person to enjoy this. Alternatively, I would not say it's super easy but I don't have anything to compare my experience to. All in all, if you want a fun way to spend the evening with friends or family, this is a great choice for fans! I would say depending on what year ( level) you're in, game play can last anywhere from 1-2.5 hours. In fact, I started playing the movies when we would start the games from the 2nd year go forward and often times we'd finish the game with the movie. (We did take breaks, or make a snack, walk our dogs when necessary... so it didn't technically take as long as the movie but hopefully that's a good gauge.) highly recommend!

  This is very much an advanced deck building game. We haven’t played past game one yet but I am looking forward to getting more into it.It says 11 and up, which is probably for the best unless your kid already is really into card games and deck builders. My 10 yo had fun with it but is still struggling a little with continuous card effects.Super positive note: this truly is a cooperative game. No one wins if someone loses. It is absolutely players vs the game. I found it an excellent way to use family time to bond instead of pitting ourselves against one another to win a game.This is a must have for Potterhead Gamers everywhere.UPDATE:We’ve made it to Game 4 and holy woah! We got our butts kicked. We had been playing up to Game 3 for weeks and hadn’t lost a game yet but adding 4 was the game changer.Still a lot of fun and now we have a challenge ahead of us that we can work out together as a family.

If you are fan of Harry Potter and like board games my opinion is you will like this.
","

  If you are fan of Harry Potter and like board games my opinion is you will like this.  I've only played this with my wife, therefore, it was two people against the game.  The first 2-3 decks/adventures are fairly easy.  I believe it is the fourth deck/adventure where it got much harder and we beat it only 1 out of 4 times so far.  We haven't tried the other decks yet.  Depending on how the non-playing villain's cards are shuffled and turned over can make the game easy or downright HARD.  I would assume playing 3-4 players makes the game much easier, but its a fun challenge.  We sit with our Harry Potter wands and 'cast' the spells when we play a spell card.  I'd estimate the first few decks take less than an hour, but the fourth deck (the ones that introduce the dice) is taking at least 90 minutes of casual play.  Replay value is high as it all depends on which cards you choose to add to your play deck.  You may go a few games without seeing the powerful cards again, or your team mate may take that card and make it unavailable for you to use.

  My son, daughter, and I enjoyed playing this at first.  However, it is just too easy.  It gets progressively harder, but we are on the 6th part and my kids have lost interest already (so have I).  The games also last longer the further along you get, but doesn't really get any harder (except for a few nuisances that are thrown in, like drawing an extra event card, and facing multiple bad guys).  This does prolong the game, but if you get cards that take away a mark on the location early in the game, there is ZERO challenge.  You are able to take away the marks on a location more frequent than you add them.  I guess I should mention you win by defeating all the bad guys before losing all 3 locations.  Unfortunately, it just feels like you are just going through the motions over and over...knowing that you are going to eventually win.

It works. Good quality. Lots of cards.
","

  Great fun. Nice cooperative game to play with others to avoid hurt feelings, players ""out of the game"", and to make things feel low-stakes and casual. You never really rely on others players, it's just that some players can help each other out when possible, but no one loses before anyone else. You all lose at once.There aren't any story events from the books during each year. As you progress through years, your character cards swap out for older portraits and new enemies and spells are introduced, but your starting character spells never change. You always have to rebuild the deck and gain low level spells even in later years, which seems pretty silly. The strategy can be dumbed down after a while and it really just depends on who the starting villains you get dealt are. You could spend as long as you want building your deck if you get someone like Crabbe and Goyle in the first round.Dont expect this to be story-rich or something. Seems to just be harry potter themed, in the sense that this could really be almost any other story or universe that has multiple books or a serialized progression and it would also have worked fine. They just happened to pick Harry Potter. That could be a good thing however, since you essentially need zero harry potter knowledge to play.

So much fun and adheres to the canon really well!

  This is a cooperative deck building game that ultimately follows along with the 7 Books to create 7 Games that build off of each other as you develop your game play ability. Just like the characters in the books/movies. Really a fantastic concept. You and/or the other players play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Nevile. The object is to defeat the villains (Draco, A Basilisk, Dementors, etc.) before said villains take over all your locations.We really like that, just like the novels, this game builds on itself 7 times. Game 1 is complete in and of itself, but adding the material of another “Game box” will change it in certain ways. Each of the boxes change the locations you’re competing for along with adding in new abilities, items, spells, villains…. You get new abilities as you “mature” and can add an additional ability to your proficiencies after completing your O.W.L.s!! One of the game boxes also add dice...to a deck building game that starts off without dice. Pretty Cool!The board, cards, and tokens are all very good quality with everything is in full color and images taken from the movies. Nothing flimsy or wanting and your character grows up as your progress (just like in “real-life”). It’s nice that the game developers include organizer cards if you don’t want the game mixed together and want to divide it back out to the separate levels without having to stick them back into the separate boxes (all the villains together, all the Dark Art Events together, etc.) once you've opened the individual games box and moved up the “Game”.I’ve been trying to find a way to get my partner more into board games and because of the individual Game 1-7 add-on features, this is an excellent intro to Eurogames. It starts off simple but ramps up after you get used to the mechanics. Also, it helped that with her love of Harry Potter this games adherence to the canon really well!!

Really fun game night addition!
","

  About two years ago, my boyfriend got me into board games. We have about twenty games on our board game shelving unit, some of my favorites being Ticket to Ride: Europe, Dominion, and some party games like Codenames and Sushi Go. I've been turned into a board game addict and find myself finding any excuse to throw a game night possible. We've converted both of our extended families (that previously claimed to be ""not into board games"") and some of our friends into board game people. HOWEVER, my boyfriend has been playing games like Settlers of Catan for about twenty years now, is very analytical, great at strategy, and you can probably see where I'm going with this- he kicks our butts in everything all the time without trying. I usually come in a solid second place, but even when he's tried to let me win games, I don't normally do too hot. CONSEQUENTLY, I'm into co-op games now and we use this game to ease highly competitive family members into a new way of thinking of games when they've only played Monopoly.If you ask the boyfriend, he says that years 1-3 of this game are too easy and repetitive. If you ask me, they're still fun and are especially great for getting newbies used to turns before things get to be high stakes. You can play as many or as few years in one sitting as you want, so for the sake of time, we do usually start at year 4 when we play this game with just the two of us. We've actually only gotten through year 7 about 4 times and still have yet to win. If you play with 4 players, you just take too much damage and the locations get taken over pretty quickly as a consequence. No biggie if you're playing with an experienced group that likes a challenge, but a group of our friends got demoralized by year 7 and ask to skip it when we play this game with more than 3 people.Also- you don't really have to know anything about Harry Potter to play this game. It certainly helps, but you'll be fine if you're just looking for another co-op game to play and know nothing.

Great Harry Potter Game!!!

  This is an awesome game that the creators put a lot of thought into it. I first thought that this was going to be a very cheesy movie game and its far from that. There are 7 games in this big box. Basically its 1 for each year or book. I'm not going to give away any spoilers here so don't worry. The first year is fairly easy but if your not working together you could easily loose. As you progress with each year/game box you can see how difficult it can be. There is also new foes to beat each round as well as the old ones. Each year you move on to you are adding to the game. Year 4/game 4 you get some upgrades. This was/is a lot of fun to play. You do have to talk with your fellow players to work out a strategy to defeated the villains.My only complaint I have is not with the game but with Amazon. The game was shipped to me with just plastic wrap and shipping label on it. So much for the element of surprised. I expected it to arrive in a box as nearly everything else I have ordered tends to arrive in. But instead it was shipped with a plain simple plastic wrap and arrived slightly damaged on the corner.Outside of that, if you are on the fence about this game just go ahead and get it--you will not be unhappy that you did. Also find a youtube video on how they play the game as well.

Best HP Game I've Played!

  I bought this on a whim for my twelve year old Harry Potter fan last Christmas and it was an instant hit! It took a little bit to get the rules down but if you're used to deck building games, it comes a little easier. I was worried it would be a one hit wonder but we've played it dozens of times since then! It's easy to go back and play through because it's different every time, though we usually stick to the third or later games if all four of us are playing. My kids have also been known to pull out the board and cards and play on their own or make up their own games to go with the pieces. It's been a ton of fun for all of us and I'm so glad we purchased it. My nine year old had no trouble with the game or rules, though she gets a little impatient if the game is taking a while. Overall, the designers did a really great job with this game. We even bought the expansion pack and love that too! I thought it would just be a money grab gimmick but it's actually really well done and a lot of fun. I definitely recommend it!

  All I do with my life is play this game.... My sister and I are obsessed with it.

  Great for two players. It's cooperative / easy on the marriage.  Well made game that walks you through each of the books.  The game gets more and more complicated the more you play it (the first book is almost too easy and the last book is almost too hard).  The advantage with this is that you are nearly guaranteed at least 7 play-throughs (which is rare) since each book adds something new and more complicated / more challenging.  There are elements of luck, which sometimes can make you lose pretty quickly, but mostly it's a well-balanced game with luck and strategy.  It's a deck-building game, so you have to pick a strategy and build your deck around it to succeed (except for the first two books, which play more like a warm-up / intro to the game, where you can get away with using no strategy.

  Fantastic game. Be warned, it is difficult. We played at the beginning with box one. Even if you are familiar with this style of game, you should start with one. It's a great slow intro to the game. It took multiple trys to get past each box.My wife and I also play just the 2 of us. When doing 2 player, I highly recommend playing as all 4 characters. Each player plays as 2 of the main characters and game plays as normal. I do not see how you could play it with just 2 of the 4. The game is difficult. A lot of the time winning is a matter of chance with how the villains are drawn. Get a bad combination of villains out and you can pretty much hang it up. You're not going to win.If you are a sore looser. Pass on this game. YOU ARE GOING TO LOOSE! This isn't an easy win, get a participation award just for showing up kinda game.

  Bought this for my sister and her boyfriend.  We played Games 1 through 4 so far.  The first couple of games (1 -3) are more or less introductory - learning the basics of what you can do and not do each turn/round. Game play is basic but enjoyable.  We had almost no fear of ""losing"".  By the time we started playing game four...things got interesting and more complex.  We lost the first time we played round 4 but were able to beat it on the second try.  We've played other deck building games before such as Clank, Dominion, and others...and this one is a new favorite too.  You do need to cooperate with each other, playing to each person's character strengths which could mean allowing each team member to purchase the right cards that benefit the group instead of your individual wants at times...example: I played as Ron and his card deck works best with more ""ally"" cards.  My sister would pass on purchasing some of the ally cards to make sure I could own them on my turn.  My brother played as Nevil and his strengths were in healing, so he typically gathered cards that allowed him to give all ""heroes"" extra hearts.

We (parents) even played without the kids one night!There are seven games (progressively harder) inside the box. The first three games are basically to help you understand the rules and learn how to play. So, we easily beat the first three games, but it was great to learn as we had never played a deck-building game before.  Game 4 had us stumped until we figured out a strategy.Overall, this is the only deck-building game we've played, but if you are a fan of the books or movies I recommend this!

Great game but a few issues with this edition
","

  I'm writing a review of this edition of Taboo, not the game in general, which is great!There are a few issues with this edition of Taboo, which likely have been covered thoroughly in other reviews, so I'll just go over them briefly.- The squeaker: it doesn't have the same impact of the traditional buzzer and isn't as fun to use. Also, dogs will seriously think it's a toy for them as it sounds exactly like a dog squeaky toy.- No card holder: In a game in which you flip through cards under a time limit, it was nice to have the old holder so you can easily flip through cards. Now you just hold a loose stack of cards and place the used ones on the table or floor - just a bit messy and disorganized. I tried getting a holder from one of the old games, but these cards are a tiny bit too big to fit, so it doesn't work.- Text size: Compared to the old cards (see picture for comparison), these ones have smaller text, and a different word on top and bottom of each side of the card (so total of 4 words). This makes the text of the ""taboo"" words just a bit on the small side, so if you're watching to make sure your opponent isn't saying the words, you may have to lean in a little to read them. Of course there are twice as many words for a given amount of cards, but I liked the simplicity of having one word per card side.Great, fun game to play with friends but I would look for an older edition for a better playing experience. You might just have to explain a few words like Y2K to some of your younger friends.

  Taboo has been one of my all-time favorite games.- It's a super simple game to understand.- It's hilarious to see how people act under pressure. I've been in tears laughing while playing this game. People can say the funniest things, especially since the game is designed in a way that makes you speak in strange ways since you're permitted from use certain words.- It's a great party game, as it requires little explanation, and you can easily pick it up and put it down whenever you're tired of playing.- You don't always need to keep score. Taboo is a game that's fun to just play without worrying about score.- Great for families, kids, or friends.PLAYING WITH 2 OR 3 PLAYERS:While Taboo is technically for 4+ players, I've had a lot of fun playing it with 2 and 3 players. With 3 players, you each take turns giving clues while the other two players guess. The person who guesses correctly gets 1 point, and the clue giver also gets one point, so everyone is incentivized to guess correctly. 2 players isn't as fun, since one player can easily prevent the other from scoring, but if you're less worried about score, this game can still be a lot of fun with just 2 people. One person guesses while the other gives clues. The clue giver is the only one who can score, so each player must make an honest effort when guessing.

He and my dad teamed up, and each of them literally said ONE WORD to the other one, and the other one would guess the correct word!! I wish I had video taped it, as it was a classic episode of game playing - they were totally in sync and it showed how fabulous this game can be and how fast paced it can move!

I almost took off a star because this latest version of the game seems significantly easier than older editions - our teams of two people almost always figured out the mystery word, whereas in the past a lot of words went unguessed. Despite this, everyone had a good time and wanted to play again which IMO is what counts most.

My Family’s Favorite Game
","

  This game is my family’s all-time favorite game.  As another reviewer wrote, however, there are a few minor issues with this specific edition:- The squeaker: It’s not a traditional buzzer like previous versions, and as result, is not as much fun.  Also, dogs will honestly think it's a toy for them as it sounds exactly like a dog squeaky toy.- No card holder: In a game in which you flip through cards under a time limit, it was nice to have the old holder so you can easily flip through cards.  Now you just hold a loose stack of cards and try to figure out where to put them.- Text size: The font on each card is super small.  I hope you’re not near-sighted like me!

Fun and Funny
","

  Why I chose this game:-I bought this game because I had played it a few times and was VERY good at it. I wanted something I could challenge my friends to, and then blow them out of the water.-I also bought this game to play with my father when he visits. We don't have a lot in common, so it's often difficult to find things for us to do together for ""quality time"". Board games are usually a universal way to bring people together.PROS:-You'll definitely get some laughs with this game.-It's easy to play, and those who have never played can learn the game rules and be playing in probably under 3 minutes.-It's a game I would play with my parent, so that should tell you that it's not too risque of a game despite its name.CONS:-I did notice the timer thing is a bit funny, like other reviewers have said. I didn't mind this though, as I like to use the timer on my phone anyway as it is easier to control.Ultimately, I would recommend this game to any of my friends with glowing reviews.

Used it as an expansion
","

  We play Taboo so much that we started to repeat the same cards over and over. We basically bought this edition just to use it as an expansion to the 2010 edition with the battery operated ""uhoh"" buzzer. The cards fit in/on the holder, and for that reason I'm pleased with it. If I bought this as a standalone game, I'd be a little disappointed because:1. The squeaker is a dog toy. Let's not pretend.2. There is no holder like previous editions.This edition is worth it as an expansion though. I might even buy the Midnight edition in the future for the same reason.

Great addition to game night!
","

  I bought this as an addition to our monthly game night. It brings out the competitive side to everyone. The clicker is a little different from other versions of taboo. My older game has a button for the beep, whereas this one comes with a rubber noise maker you squeeze. Still does the trick but maybe that could be a turn off to some. It comes with plenty of cards with words on both sides and a choice of 4 different lists. The die is something to mention as it's different from normal taboo. There's I believe 8 different sides to the die and each side of the die means a different thing.  From play the normal way to each team can participate. It's a good game to test your brain power and fast thinking skills. It's also kid friendly which is a plus.

Cheap product
","

  I have been playing Taboo for years and boy was I very disappointed when I opened this game.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is still fun to play.  I have owned several versions of the game and here are the differences.  In this version the cards are paper thin, where other versions, the cards were laminated.  I will say you get more clues because four come on a card.  There is no holder for the cards so it is hard to keep turn the cards and pass the cards from player to player especially if you are playing with a large group.  It gets messy.  The buzzer is a rubber squeak toy.  I had to substitute with spoons and bowls because it was driving my dog crazy because he thought it was his toy.  I am keeping the game because I have an older version where I can use the holder and the buzzer.  Otherwise it is cheap.  I would have been willing to pay the extra money to have a better made game.

Fun Game
","

  My daughter wanted this for Christmas. I've played the game before, but we have never owned it. I was telling her about the buzzer feature and was surprised to learn that there is no buzzer. Instead, there is a plastic vinyl squeezable squeaker instead. We were playing it at a friend's house and their dog was very interested in the squeezer. It's very similar to a dog squeeze toy. So we had to be careful with it and put it away when not in use. The game play was pretty much how I remembered it. It's a fun game for groups.

  I've had this game before.  It was actually ""stolen"" 3x lol It's that entertaining!! lolActually, every time I go to my friends/family's place, I'd always bring Taboo, but bc everyone wants to play it every time, I just end up leaving the game there. Hence, my 4th time buying this.It's perfect for all demographics, friends, family, or strangers events. It makes a great gift.The game is very easy to play; you just gotta be a quick thinker and a million dollar vocab helps, too.Each card is has a set of words (taboo words) and the word to be guessed at the top.  The person whose turn it is must describe the word to his or her teammate without saying the taboo words.

Where's the Buzzer?!?!
","

  Who doesn't like taboo? It's a fun party game, BUT sometime between the first few I bought for myself and gifts, they changed a classic feature. Now, instead of the electronic buzzer, Hasbro replaced it with what is essentially a handheld whoopy cushion. It's lame. The BUZZER kind of made the game. The new handheld squeaker thing feels cheap and everyone who had played before longed for the days with the buzzer. If you're thinking of buying this game, I highly recommend finding an older version with the buzzer. You'll be glad you did. I promise it makes a difference.

The old version is better!
","

  I LOVE Taboo- who doesn't!? I was very excited to open this brand new set with a group of friends recently. However, opening this version of the game was such a letdown! It's designed for ants! Here are the top three reasons this version stinks:1. There are no card holders. What the heck! You either have to hold the cards in your hand as you flip them, or use what I think is a makeshift card holder built into the box. The cardholder is a central piece of the game. HOW in the world could they have eliminated this?!2. The cards are tiny (therefore, font is tiny) and are about as thin as copy paper. They feel cheap and unimportant in your hand. Nothing like real playing cards!3. The ""buzzer"" is pathetic. It is not even a buzzer, it is basically a plastic dog toy and the sound it makes is a shy, airy squeak.

Game arrived in good condition with all parts
","

  Game arrived in good condition with all parts. My only qualm is that the original buzzer has been replaced by a squeaker and I have a dog that has been trained to viciously rip these out of toys she gets on the regular. I opened the game with excitement, testing everything out. While fiddling with the squeaker (it is not easy to squeek) I finally managed to create noise and to my horror, my dog dropped the ball she was actively playing with, with my father-in-law and directed all attention to the Taboo squeaker. I spent 5 minutes explaining to the dog that the squeaker was mine but already in play mode, my dog did not want to hear it and incessantly stared into my soul for the one thing in the world she knew was for sure hers from the damn noise. I put the game back in the box and she sniffed and stared for another 5 minutes before moving on with her life.I will likely give her the squeaker next time the box is opened as I am not strong of will. We will be forced to verbally abused those who mess up to ensure they know they have made a mistake.If you have a dog, I would recommend a different version of the game or practice making buzzer noises. There's probably an app for that.

Excellent game, too much packaging
","

  We love this game and think it's the perfect night-cap when we have family and friends over. Here are my findings:1. I got this game for a family game night on vacation. Our vacation was on a sailboat for a week, so we had to be careful with our packing--the boat only had limited storage space--as did our luggage. So, I took all of the items out of this box and they fit into a small Ziploc bag...way too much packaging!2. This particular game comes with a squeeze buzzer, rather than the battery-powered buzzer that the older version comes with. That means that we have to put my dog in the garage when we play because he gets to excited about the squeeze noise.3. The box comes with a pad to keep score for only two teams per sheet. We played with three teams, so we had to modify the pad. It's a tiny pad, so it was a little difficult to see our tiny little hashes when it was time to tally the score. Also, there was no pencil with the box, so we had to look through bags on the boat to find one.I love this game and would buy it over and over.

Very Satisfied - Why ??? Read On !!!

  I always like games promote communication. Taboo is one of many. Avalon is a better one !!!I am a light to medium strategy gamer, so I rarely touch the ""Mass Market Board Games"" but I have a weak spot for Taboo and Password because I consider myself is a awesome clue giver ~ ~ ~Components:- Very high quality squeaker, people here are complaining about they switch from the electronic buzzer to a squeaker, come on, simple is better, and no batter is needed.- Sand timer is good and the die is heavy for its size and very good quality.- I like it how they are 4 words per card now, so you get 162 cards in the game which means you are getting 648 words per game. This increase the replayability of the game ~Game play:- House rule. I bought this game with the intention to play with international students, and regular Taboo is already hard for most native English speakers, therefore to house rule it, you can play it backward, all you can say is the 5 words listed below the word you are trying to get people to guess. Try it and see what happened ~Full Disclosure:- One other thing makes me like this game is I bought it for $6.99 + tax here on Amazon with FREE Shipping !!! What a Deal ~

Good but the Original is Better.

  The original game is much easier and more fun to play so if you do not have that, I recommend buying that one instead. This is a decent game for anyone who has never played before or who has played the original version so many times that they need a refresh version. This game has a squeaker instead of a buzzer as in the original. It also does not have a card holder, which made game play more erratic as it puts pressure on the ""caller"" to make sure they don't set it down so everyone can see, or wave it around- or a many variety of other accidental mistakes we kept running into.

Great game

  It's a very fun game and a lot of people can play it at the same time. The game is played in teams. You get a word and your teammates have to guess what the word is by the clues you give them. It gets a little difficult because some words you are not allowed to use, which are the obvious clues to the answer. The person next to you holds a buzzer and buzzes when you use one of the clues on the do not use list. When you get buzzed, you lost that round and the point goes to the opposing team. It can get rowdy and it really liven up the party. My kids as young as eight were able to play it although some they wouldn't be able to answer. Adults in their 60s were playing it as well. Great game.

  This version is a serious downgrade from the original game. I love Taboo and had a lot of fun playing it. My dislike of this game is mainly because the cards are very simple. This is supposed to be updated and modernized, but there are more cards that say basic things like Zebra, Spy, Tickle, Brown, or Jedi. The older version of the game has more creative cards with celebrity names, movie titles, places, etc. You can easily download (free) better versions of this game on your phones app store.If you mainly play this with children or tweens, this might not be a bad choice.

  Well I guess I didn't read the description closely, but I was expecting the traditional Taboo game with the card holder and an actual buzzer. Instead you are provided a ""squeaker"" to squeak a taboo word. Picture a small dog toy and that is what the ""squeaker"" is. How disappointing!

I'm sure a lot of people will miss the old loud and super-annoying buzzer (it's fun to scare people with it while they're concentrating), but at least with the newer one you don't have to worry about replacing batteries ever and just start playing.

My 5 year old enjoys playing this, and it's a nice game to play if you have young children playing, or need something to play with the grandparents.  It's a nice alternative to Uno.  However, the game is fairly simple, relies a lot on luck and less on strategy.  What other people play rarely affects your turn.  It's a nice game but if you're looking for something that requires ""card sense"" and skill, look elsewhere.  Basically this is a game where you are trying to get your cards to have the lowest total possible, so moves are like ""Do I take this face up card with a 5 on it, or hope the card face down on the top of the draw pile has a lower number?""  For the younger kids, it reinforces taking turns and basic addition skills and feels like a ""grown up"" game.  Our family enjoys playing it and I have given it as gifts.  However, advanced gamers would want something more substantial.

  I was skeptical about this game, because it sounded just like others (Golf, Uno, etc), but while it is similar, it’s not exactly the same, and I find it to be more fun than games like Uno. It’s very easy in concept, but fun and it moves quickly. Easy enough for our six yr old to play, but intriguing enough that the adults love it too. Has very quickly become one of our favorite games and was the first choice requested by family members on the latest camping trip. I love that it’s a game that our entire family can enjoy together and we all love the simple additions that make it interesting, like the color scheme. The negative numbers (which are the most desired) are deep purple, indicating cold, and color intensity changes according to how high (hot) the numbers get, going from deep purple to icy blue, to grass green, sunny yellow, and finally bright red. Highly recommend!

  Skyjo has undoubtedly become my favorite card game of the year. It's easy to set up, simple to play, yet has a layer of complexity to its strategy, while also incorporating sheer luck. It's very similar to the card game Golf. So how does it work?The ultimate goal is to keep the score low. The deck of cards contains values as low as -2 and as high as 12, so a player wants to swap out their high cards for lower ones, in order to end up with the lowest total score at the end of the round. However, at the beginning of the round, players have no idea which cards are in their collection!Each player lays out a 3x4 grid of facedown cards. During a turn, a player can take the top card from either the draw or discard pile, then exchange it for a card in the grid (faceup or facedown, doesn't matter). Herein lies the luck component, because one might draw the low number of 3 and take a chance on exchanging it with an unseen card, only to find that the hidden card was a 0! Each movement is a bit of risk. Upon drawing a high number, a player may immediately discard it--but they must also immediately flip an unseen card. Play continues until one player has revealed every card in the grid, at which point, all players reveal their cards and add up their scores. A new round begins, and the game goes on until one player reaches 100 points!There may be a player who gets lucky and ends up with lots of low cards in the deck, which may entice them to race through the game, forcing others to get stuck with high cards. However, there's a rule to help mitigate this approach: the first player to reveal all their cards MUST also be the lowest scorer for the round. If not, their score doubles. (I find it helpful to play the first round without this rule, then introduce it during round two, once people understand have caught on to the basics.) This helps to control the pace and give other players more opportunity to get rid of crap cards!The game moves really fast and is fun for all ages. (Computing scores might be tricky for younger ones, but it's a good introduction to negative values. Also, leaving out the aforementioned rule may be helpful with really young players.) If you're tired of Uno and want to level up, Skyjo is what you're looking for!

Fun Game for Everyone!
","

  I just got this game a few days ago, and have already played it many times with people of different ages. Skyjo is simple to teach, and easy to pick up and play... even for younger kids... but it's also quite satisfying for order kids, teens and adults. On the most basic level, you are playing the deck against the array of cards that you are dealt, so it doesn't have a strong ""competitive"" feel. This makes it great for anyone who just loves to play! It also enforces basic math, and even a bit of probability ( example- what are the chances of drawing another 5??). I think this game is perfect for classrooms to reinforce lessons. BUT it's not just an educational tool. Its fun too. Play one round... or play several (to 100 points). This little game fits in really well with our family game night.

  The reviews on this product are all correct my daughter and I love this game and play it three to four times a week.  It's amazing how bad your score is the first time you play but after the 5th time you clue in to the strategy and then it becomes a true strategy game and a bit of luck and memorization to win the game.  Can't say enough good things about this game so just go buy it you will not regret it trust me !!!!

GREAT! Colorful, quick, light family game
","

  Wow, I was really surprised by how much fun this game is. Everyone I have introduced this game to really loves it. Very colorful cards that range from -2 (dark blue) to 12 (red). It's a card replacement game wherein the players try to get the lowest total score in their 4 x 3 (12 cards) matrix of cards on the table. Each round lasts about 5 to 7 minutes with experienced players. An actually game (first person to 100 points) lasts about 20 to 30 minutes.  Reminds me of other colorful card games like Skip Bo, Uno, etc.This game is a wonder light game for all ages. I've even played with the full eight players and it still plays very well.Get this game!

  We got this and played it before Christmas.  Its similar to Golf.  There's not a lot of skill involved, but its pretty fun.  Others in my family liked it so well they bought it for themselves.  All age groups can play, its easy to learn, and game time is however long you want to keep playing.  Lots of shuffling because the discard pile ends up with all the bad cards.  It must be good as we kept pulling it out to play again.  If more than 5 play you end up recycling the bad cards.  Best for 4-5 people.

  We love this game.  I have played a different version of this game with a regular deck of cards.  It is called golf.  Same concept except the game ends after the 9th round, hence, the name golf.  I prefer this game because it is a little more challenging because it is played with twelve cards instead of 9.  However, we still use the rule to end the game after 9 rounds instead of the first one that reaches a score of 100.

  We have REALLY enjoyed playing this game!!  We have played this card game with 4 different groups of friends and family and everyone who has played really likes it - even one of my friends who does not usually like to play games!  It's sort of addicting actually!  After our first experience with the game, i have ordered it four other times as gifts!  The game is simple enough for elementary aged children, yet interesting enough for adults.  Our group of friends (all in our 50's) enjoyed playing.  Cards are colorful. Had to read through the rules a few times - but once they are understood they are easy to explain.  I am very pleased that I came across this game.  Also - you can play this game with up to 8 people - so that is also a plus.

  Our family is always looking for fun games and I decided to give this one a try based on all good reviews. So much fun! We played it almost every day during summer (youngest is 8 and had no problems). When we visited our family and took game with us, our parents love it too and asked us if they can keep it since they enjoyed playing it as well. Of course we gifted a game, and when we came home we bought a replacement for our home. It’s a lot of fun. I would say 60% of luck and 40% strategy. Definitely more challenging than uno!  It will make a wonderful Christmas gift for any family that enjoys card games.

  This was a Christmas gift, but I had the opportunity to play it.  It was a fun game, using memory, strategy, and math skills.  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I felt the instructions were difficult to understand, more than likely due to the translation.  I played with a 9 and 11 yr. old., who read the instructions aloud.  For example, the instructions weren't clear as to whether one or two decks should be used.  We all enjoyed playing!

  I'm always looking for good games for after dinner. We especially play on the weekends after drinking some wine. Some games are more difficult, but this one totally works with wine night. We have a few non-gamers in the family, but they will play this one, too. It's easy to pick up and goes pretty quickly. The fun part is the randomness of the cards. you don't know what you have until you turn it over, so strategy only works to a degree.

  Our kids have really taken to this fun and easy game! We have 2 kids who are English as a 2nd language, so we really love games that don’t require reading, or loads of talking. Our ESl kids are 13 and 12, so they don’t want baby games, and this checks all the boxes! Our 7 year old also learned how to play very quickly and this game really helps him with math in a fun way. Also, the game is meant to end when someone reaches 100 points, but we’ve never played that long. We declare at the start how many hands we are going to play, then we just see how has the fewest points at the end. And this works just fine.If you’re looking for a new card game, grab this one!!

  Thrilling, annoying, deceptive, strategic, and addictive all describe Skygo. This colorful card game can keep you at the edge of your seat for quite a while. If you happen to be hungry while playing Skygo, well you are in luck, as the manufacturers claim that “when playing, your hands are free, so you can count points or eat snacks.” In other words, if you are at a family gathering playing and want to chow down on some food, go right ahead. You will not have to worry about dropping the cards as they are not meant to be kept in your hands but rather stay on the table in a 3x4 grid, of which the cards are initially facing down. If you like looking at the cards you have directly, this may not be the game for you. Sound strange and need more details? You may begin looking at your cards whenever it is your turn either by taking the card from the preceding player or the top card from the draw pile. This is where all the excitement starts! You could have the luck of a lottery winner by receiving a -2 (the lowest a card can go) or not so much when you pull a 12 (the highest a card can go) from the draw pile. The strategic part then comes in, as you decide where you want to place the card. You may get rid of a column by having three of the same upward facing cards. It may be nerve-wracking when you replace a downward facing card with the one you just chose as you could have just awarded the next person the card they have been aching for the past few rounds. The smartest move, however, could also be the riskiest move by placing a card that the next person needs in your grid, blocking them from going out. The goal of the game is to have the lowest amount of points until someone has revealed all of their cards. If someone were to reveal all of their cards, every other player is given one last chance to better their score. Also, you could be the reason why the person who went out first has to double their points if you happen to end with a lower score than theirs.Yes, this game is fairly simple and yes, this game is similar to many other games (golf, Uno, etc.), but that should not stop you from buying this game. Even though this game has an easy concept, it allows for nice and smooth gameplay with everyone at the table, regardless of age and attention span. For the young ones, this game brings in an educational value with addition and learning how to take turns. For teenagers, young adults, and adults of the family, this game is strategic. This especially holds true depending on how many people play the game. If there are two people, the low point cards will be flying everywhere. However, if there are eight people, the best move could be collecting the higher cards and placing them in a column (3 cards) to get rid of them. While some may say that they have “no clue how to play” or “took a while to learn,” some may find a bright side to that. A few practice rounds in and you could potentially find yourself having fun with others.

  Trying to find a fun card game for the kids for Christmas and this was one of the games I went with. I love playing games with the kids and we all enjoyed this! My kids are ages: 17, 15, and 11. The point of the game is to try and get the lowest score to win. There's some luck and some strategy to this game, which I like. If you ""go out"" (flip all your cards over) first, you better make sure you have the lowest points! Otherwise your points double. My son and I decided to change the rules up and try to get the highest points to win, which was a fun twist. I can see this game getting ""old"" after a few rounds played in a row, but it's one I will keep in the game wheel-house of fun ones to play.

  This is hands down the best game I have played in my entire life.  My family of five ages from 12-54 played this game daily thru out the Covid shut down.  It absolutely saved our sanity.  It’s great for a group- although more than 6 you run pretty low or out of cards- or just one on one!  Each hand is less than five minutes long (take that Uno!) but numerous hands can be played as a tournament or to the score of 100 as recommended.  Strategy plays a part but so does luck, so the novice never gets discouraged playing against the pro!  Recently gifted it to so many people- my parents and friends-  but my step mother said even her 3 year old Grand kid loves it so good for ages 3-77 at least!

The divider inside is simple cardboard but works well to keep the cards and score sheet separate.

  Bought this purely from reviews on Amazon.  As other have mentioned, the instructions seem to make the game harder than it really is, but once you got it, it's a blast.  Have given the game to others and they enjoy it as well.  One of our family favorites.  I bought a card shuffler as well because 1. I am horrible at shuffling in the first place and 2. this game has a lot of cards.  ;-)  Highly recommend.  It's a lot of fun.

  Our neighbors told us about this game and we ordered it because they played with their adult children and the best part is young (4-5 yrs) can play with no help and a 3yr could alone if they know their numbers but with help if they don't!  It is just a lot of fun for all and we have played it with our adult friends also.  One of the great things for kids is they don't have to hold the cards!  I would highly recommend!

  This game has revolutionized our family gaming time, it is so addicting to play🤣 and because it can cater up to 8 individuals it allows everyone in the family to join. It is easy to learn after one round of playing and the allotted time to play allows more time together as a family, this is an excellent game for kids to develop better mathematical skills in addition, subtraction & multiplication.👍 Not disappointed with this buy.

Definitely a fun game to play with the entire family.  I can't wait for our next game night.

  We were tired of all of the classics and decided to give this a shot.  Very fast to learn.  Nice mix of strategy and luck.  Easy to adjust how long each game will take by just raising the lowering the points you must reach to lose.  (Low score wins....like golf).  Everyone in the family liked it immediately.

Possibly the funniest kids game I've ever played
","

  I review about 1 out of 50 things I buy but given how expensive games are and how hit or miss they can be, I wanted to come on here and give this game two giant thumbs up. I got this for my youngest daughter (10) for Christmas but we never ended up playing it before our older daughters went back to college. It's set up like apples to apples so you should have at least 4 to play. This weekend one of our girls came home for spring break and we took advantage of having 4 people at home and I'm really glad we did. We laughed for hours and played 6 games in a row, which is a miracle for us. We have all girls and they loved this but I can see how this would be an even bigger hit with boys. Lots of bodily functions mentioned on the answer cards with plenty of hilarious questions to take full advantage. The only thing I would say is that your family has to have some appreciation for bathroom humor or you won't enjoy this game. Its not a game you bring out and play with other people unless you know them well.

  I bought this as a gift for my sister, BIL and their four kids for Christmas. I wanted something fun and easy to play with a large family on game night. My nieces and nephews are 10, 12, 14, & 16 yo. While the youngest seemed to like it, the older ones got bored with its attempts of gross humor quickly. While it aims at being appropriately inappropriate, it just seems cheesy. - like the cards try too hard. I wish I would have picked something else.Most appropriately inappropriate for kids age 6-10yo who still find this potty humor funny.

Laugh So Hard You Cry

  Got this to play with the family over Thanksgiving because I have enjoyed playing Cards Against Humanity with adults before. The group consisted of two adults (one early 30's, one late 30's) and two kids (boy 11, girl 9). It was clear to see the difference in humor between the adults and kids, but that did not stop any of us from laughing our heads off. We must have played for a few hours, honestly I am not sure because we just kept going and going, laughing more and more. There were small giggles, loud laughs, unstoppable laughs, and literally tear induced laughs. This is a definite keeper for our family gatherings. Can't wait to play it again!

Family* fun card game (*may want to review cards for your family)

  Bought this for my family and then another for a friends' son's birthday because I thought they would really enjoy it, too. If Apples to Apples is too tame and Cards Against Humanity is too much for your family this is a great middle ground. As with CAH, you may want to review the cards prior to play to determine whether you think they are appropriate for your family and friends considering your personal opinions, age of players, etc. Simple game to pickup (especially if you've played either of the others mentioned). Can be played rather quickly or for quite some time if you want to make a night of it and not get bored. No expansion packs that I've seen but I'm sure if you wanted to you could mix in cards from other games or even make your own. Lots of fun!

My s-i-l called last night and said it was a huge hit. Laughter to the point of tears, and fun for all the kids, 9, 10 and 13. She said lots of poop jokes, but they all loved it.

  Absolutely the best family game I’ve found for our family. We had family members between the ages of 4 to 65 loving this game!  I wanted a game to play with the entire family during thanksgiving. I was looking for something somewhat clean, and silly, but not too silly that the adults would hate it. EVERYONE loved it!  By the end of the night, my 8 yr old nephew loved it so much he was begging his parents to buy one for him.  And the next day, my 4.5 year old son was asking to play it again at breakfast.  It’s definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it to anyone with kids. The big cheese dance is genius.  I don’t know how this would work with 2-3 players, but it’s great with 4+ players especially of multiple ages.

  My 7 year old loves this game. She does need help playing it, since her reading isn’t on the same level as some of the cards. It gets lots of laughs and is very PG. The potty humor answers always get the biggest giggles. If you are an adult this game isn’t as hilarious or entertaining as Cards Against Humanity but this game is a good clean version. There are no expansions for it yet but I may buy a competitors version and combine them to get more variety as we. Have played several times and have almost gone through all the cards.

  This game is easy to learn--everyone understands the rules after just one round, which is why this game-play format is so popular. This is a fun game to play with younger school-age kids. They need to be able to read. Lots of poop and fart jokes are included. When we played with another family, kids over 12 weren't nearly as entertained as those aged 6-11. We went through beforehand and cleaned out a few ""inappropriate"" cards (this is standard practice in our house). With these cautions, I do recommend.

  My 9 yr old daughter likes the game. I personally think it could have been designed better. A lot of the answer cards don’t match well with the fill in the blanks. You have to alter the answer for it to make sense. There are blank cards for writing your own answer, which I guess helps with this situations but you don’t always have a blank card in your hand. I think they should also provide a dry erase marker for the blank cards. We don’t really play the game correctly  because you need 3 people. We just draw and take turns matching up questions and answers.

A review for those playing with two people.
","

  This review is written specifically for those playing as a 2 player game. Mysterium is a beautiful clue giving and partner solving game where your partner will play the part of two psychics trying to figure out the who, where and how (what object) a crime was committed. To add difficulty in a 2 player game your partner plays the part of two psychics versus the usual one. The person playing the ghost will give the psychics clues in the form of surreal picture cards. From those cards the psychic tries to figure out who the ghost is pointing to, where, and finally what object was used to commit the crime. If you make it to the end stage you have narrowed it down to two suspects each with their own location and weapon. The ghost then gives three cards to her partner and from there must guess which is the correct suspect. As a two player game Mysterium is enjoyable but if you play just a few rounds you and your partner will become familiar with certain cards associated with certain suspects/locations/weapons. Once you have tuned in to each other you will have established a visual shorthand. There is an expansion set with some additional cards which will be helpful in keeping the game fresh, but I suspect more expansions will be needed to keep the game going. The game is still fun for two players but the sweet spot seems to be with four psychics and one ghost. There are are more minds at play, and the clairvoyance track comes into play which adds another dimension of fun and difficulty and the end stage. You don't use the clairvoyance track with just two people. Overall I enjoyed this as a two player game, but I have already ordered the expansion set and since there aren't many cards in the expansion, I'm hoping more are released. Recommended for two players, but expect limited replay once both people become familiar with the cards.

Love the game, instructions could use work
","

  We love this game! We've played it 8 times since getting it. Which is enough times for each person to play the ghost once/twice and we love it! It's definitely in our board game playing rotation now.Style of game:- A more adult, more fun. more challenging version of Clue.- Co-opPositives:- Great theme, we even dimmed the lights to set the mood- Good, quality components.- Beautiful artwork- Fun to play for both sides of the table. Sometimes when games have 1 person that plays as something different than the others, once side ends up not having as much fun. That isn't the case with this game.- Age rating seems pretty close. We played with a 12 year old and sit was good for her, challenging but fun. She even asked to play it again the 2nd night. She did have a little more fun and easier time at the ghost, but I think everyone will feel that way.- Game play is pretty easy to understand, once you make it through the instructions.Negatives:- Instructions could be easier to follow. It took a while to learn because of that. We watched a video though, I'd recommend that.- The screen for the ghost is a little too tall so it makes it hard to look over and see the rest of the cards on the table.- Good replay value if you play with different people every 5 or so times. If it's the same group of people I could see this becoming slightly repetitive.Personal notes:- I wouldn't play this with someone you have never met or don't know being the ghost. It relies a lot on people's interpretations of the cards and if you have no concept of the thought process of the person playing ghost it could become frustrating, very fast.- New players should play as ghost first. For us, it seemed to go a lot better that way.

Probably the most awkwardly designed board game I've ever played
","

  This had been recommended to me and it seemed like something my family would enjoy so I waited until it was on sale. I'm really glad I did because at full price I would have felt ripped off. The setup for this game takes forever. Cards have to be matched with other cards multiple times (according to the numbers on the backs) and the layout is really big and confusing which makes it hard to see certain things depending on where you're sitting. We weren't able to attach the hand to our clock, the plastic pieces wouldn't clip together no matter how many people tried. And the cards themselves are quite dark. The company recommends playing with some mood lighting on but I have no idea how you would see anything at all considering we had a hard time even in a brightly lit room. And the rules are so awkwardly written, you would be better off watching an instruction video. We've played three times and had to have the rules nearby because what happens at the end is rather convoluted but could be easily simplified. When the rules told us to do something, we all kept asking ""Why? Wouldn't it be simpler and better if...?"" over and over.The game is super, super easy. Our 5 year old won the first game we played all by himself with no help. Our 8 year old was the ghost in our second game and we never made a wrong choice. It has the air of complexity but it's even easier than Clue. I know a lot of reviews have stated that the vision cards are too vague but we haven't had that problem at all. And we discovered a flaw that guarantees a win which took the fun completely out of it and now there's no reason to ever play it again. This seriously needed to be playtested many more times before release to make it worth playing more than a few times. It very much feels like a first draft of the game rather than a finished, polished product.I really wanted to like this but you would be better off playing any other number of games with this theme.

Fun game, great artwork, quality components!
","

  This game is really fun! I have only played twice, first a 3 player game, then a 7 player one, and I was the ghost both times. It was definitely hard keeping a straight face when my friends were trying to figure out what the heck I was trying to tell them with my card choices! It did take a couple hours with the 7 of us, but 5 had never played this game (and some had never played anything other than Monopoly etc.), and the 3 player was over an hour, though part of that was reading/learning the rules. I look forward to playing as a psychic trying to interpret the ghost's clues, and while I have read that some people have played so often (presumably with the same people) that the cards are getting stale/predictable, there is an expansion that looks good (and you can probably supplement with Dixit cards too). The artwork is awesome and the components are good quality - I especially like the board the ghost uses. Fun game, definitely recommend

  This is one of the better examples of a party game done just right, I think. The game is extraordinarily simple, and easy to teach. One player is a ghost; the others are mediums trying to find out the circumstances of that ghost's murder. The ghost is unable to communicate in anything other than abstract images that are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. It's the ghost's job to figure out how to use those images to communicate either the person, place, or thing that the medium is currently searching for.Each medium, initially, has their own miniature mystery to solve, going through three steps starting with the person. At the end of the game, all of this information is combined together into a final guessing round as to which investigator's combination is the correct one - a thing that's randomly chosen by the ghost, and again communicated to the group using the Vision cards available.For a party game, this can actually be quite difficult. The Vision cards are often VERY abstract, and it will require some knowledge of how the players think to try to get them pointed in the right direction. You are all playing cooperatively, and while the investigators can freely talk among themselves about what they've seen, the ghost is required to keep silent, and not provide any tells. It makes for an extremely fun experience, but one that is definitely best in groups. It can be played two-player, but there different ways people interpret cards make it far better with more, and allow the ghost a little bit more room to use their cards with the expectation that the mediums can all help each other with their respective investigations.The components are decently made. The ghost's screen is a stand-out here, with each investigator having their own column with little pockets for the ghost to place cards. The pockets are a bit tight, making it hard to sometimes place and remove cards until they're broken in, but they feel quite sturdy. The little player pieces are made out of plastic and are a bit cheaply cast, but they get the job done. The timer is a clock made out of a few pieces of cardboard that you actually put together to stand free. Beyond that, everything else is either cards or thick cardboard chits.If you have a group that likes to do a bit of logical deduction mixed with some abstract thinking, this is a fantastic game. It's probably not something that holds up to multiple games in rapid succession, but as something to throw in the middle of a night, or just for giggles, it can make for some funny stories.

Amazing game!

  Mysterium is an amazing game where all players work together to solve a crime.There is one player who plays as the ghost that attempts to tell other players (psychics) information about the crime using cards with artwork on them.The artwork is amazing and beautiful, and the gameplay is easy to grasp and interesting.I've found that this game isn't for everyone though. There are players who prefer more concrete gameplay and dislike the notion of having to ""interpret"" what a card given by the ghost could mean.

Somewhat like Clue, but a team atmosphere and a lot more fun!
","

  I'll start by saying I love Clue.Especially for what it is: an easy to learn game of deduction. When I heard about this game people said it was just a little like Clue, but a lot more to it. That's all true, but still an easy game to pick up.Can be played with 2-7 people (we've only played with 3 so far, but really looking forward to more people!). All of the players except one play the role of psychics who try to figure out the clues given by the other play, who plays the ghost. The first round, each player is trying to decipher the clues given by the ghost to figure out which suspect they're supposed to guess (each player will try to identify a different suspect). This gets repeated with locations, then weapons (just like Clue right?). The ""clues"" that the ghost gives out to each player are vision cards: abstract pictures that could be interpreted in many different ways. The ghost tries to give out these vision cards to each player based on which suspect on the board they're trying to guess, as each suspect/location/weapon card have extra things on them telling you about the location. While this is going on, each round other players can ""bid"" on whether a player correctly guessed their card. Bidding correctly gives them extra ""points"" which will give more clues for the end of the game.Players have a limited number of rounds to have all players guess their 3 cards (suspect/weapon/location). If all players guess correctly, then you work together to find out who the actual killer/location/weapon is used. The sets of three and put out and given a number (1-6, depending on how many players are in the game). The ghost secretly picks one of the sets and puts the number token for that set face down in front of everyone.  Then the ghost picks out 3 more vision cards: one representing the suspect, one the location, and one the weapon of the set chosen. Depending on how well players bid during the game, they get to look at one, two, or all 3 cards before they vote on who they think the right set is.  Most votes is what the group goes with, and hopefully is the correct answer.For people who don't like to think outside the box when it comes to clues may not enjoy this game. Right now I've only played it with my wife and 9 year old and they both dig the game, and helping to teach my son to think more outside the box on some things to find connections and be observant (note on the 2-3 player games, no bidding happens, there's always 4 psychics so players will play multiple people, and all 3 clues are revealed to everyone at the end). Really can't wait to play with 7 people to see how that goes, but recommend this to be added to the game shelf.

Perfect gateway game and spookily thematic
","

  Mysterium is a cooperative game where you're trying to receive clues from the recently deceased player acting as a helping ghost. Each player is assigned a person, location, and weapon. Through the ghost's visual clues, each player is attempting to decide which person, location, and weapon was assigned to them. Players are encouraged to discuss the clues with one another to form conclusions. The ghost cannot speak at all, however. If the group can't get each player to guess their assigned cards before the clock strikes the final round, everyone loses. The theme in this game is awesome. Halloween, rainy day, nighttime - any of these are a perfect setting. It plays up to 7, and it works. Be aware that any player playing as the ghost has the hardest job so it's recommended that first time players should avoid that role if possible, especially with higher player counts. I can't recommend the game for 2 or 3, it's just not that fun. 4-7 players is great though. It's thematic, cooperative, and easy to play. Winning isn't always the easiest in this game, but it keeps you coming back for more. Also, kids can easily play this too. No reading is necessary and it's not a horror-themed game, don't be fooled by the box art. No gore in the art. The only thing I'll say is to avoid learning from the rule book. It took us way too long to learn and setup for our first play. It's extremely wordy. Just go to Board Game Geek or Youtube for a tutorial. It'll save you time and it's easier.

Very good, very enjoyable game

  Mysterium is easy to learn and fun to play.  It is less strategy-based than a lot of the games I usually play.  I would say it is geared more to creative, artistic people than others who prefer games of strategy and/or luck.I can describe it as a combination of Forbidden Island, Clue, and Code Names.  In Clue, you must identify the murderer, the location, and the weapon.  You have to do the same in Mysterium.  One player plays as the ghost who was murdered.  The other players serve as psychics trying to figure out what happened (how the ghost died and by whose hand).  The ghost sends visions (picture clues) to each player.  The players must try to use those visions to guess which suspect, location, and weapon the ghost is referring to.  It's like Code Names...but instead of word association, this is image association.  This is a cooperative game.  Players can work together to try to decipher the ghost's visions.  At the end of the game, everyone wins or everyone loses (including the ghost).  So in that respect, it's like Forbidden Island.Definitely a fun game and worth playing.

You need the right people to really enjoy this game
","

  I would like to start by saying that I really enjoyed this game, however, you need to right set if people to play with. Thematically, it is similar to clue in the each person is trying to identify their person, place, and weapon, but that is where the similarities end. Whereas in clue you have a very methodical way of determining the right set, in this game you are trying to guess you person, place, or weapon based on ""visions."" These visions are cards that the ghost (kind of the game leader/clue giver) provides you with. They are highly abstract pictures that often will relate to what you are supposed to guess in a very vague way. This would be harder to play with a group of people house didnt know or younger children. Additionally, you really need to be able to think outside the box because the clues are very rarely obvious at first sight. That being said, once one person understands how to play and can be the ghost, anyone can join in, because the job of the guesser is quite simple.

  The physical contents of the game are of great quality! The game itself has a lot set up involved, but it is fun to play once you start.You and other players will act as the mediums/psychics trying to solve the murder of a ghost (played by another person). The ghost will hand out clues to each player from which you must make a choice about the murderer, location, and weapon. The ghost player has to decide on the clues (which are random picture cards) that best matches with the set of info for each individual player. It is really fun to see what kind of associations and the thought process of everyone involved in this game.I've only played a very simplified version of the game, but there are different ""difficulty"" levels for the game itself which is really nice for replay value.

  Bought this as a gift for a friend who is the head of our gaming group. We've played this a couple of times already and we all absolutely love it. The theme is easily immersible if you're into anything involving mystery, ghosts, seances, or random spookiness. The game play itself turned out to feel like a mixture between Clue, Dixit, and something entirely new to me. I loved the interaction between the ghost and the psychics. The game was full of non-verbal communication and very abstract artistic messages, which we somehow managed to grasp right from the very first game. The ghost is not supposed to speak at all, and can only provide hints and answers by knocking on the table - once for yes or twice for no. This was one of those games that helped us all learn a bit more about how each of the other gamers think around the table. If you have a ghost who is an established gamer and will not be overly stressed at having to guide everyone else in the room, this can be a very simple and rewarding experience for the psychic players. This game will be hitting our table pretty often, but I would recommend playing it with a larger group of players.

I've played this a dozen times and I didn't notice that the chair has a lion head emblem on the back!""Is the ghost showing you a picture of a knight chopping down a tower with a sword because they want to tell you the murder weapon is a sharp thing? Or a metal thing? or the candelabra because the tower is shaped like a candle?We've been playing this game at work and it's become our favorite team building exercise.

  The contents of the box are pretty good, the artwork is nice and well thought out. The layout, unfortunately, is where the problems start. This game requires way too much play space if you follow the guidelines of the instructions. More than games like Betrayal House on the Hill.The gameplay itself is abstract where the ghost/spirit/random dead player is trying to get the players to use their psychic abilities to decern the when, where, and how of how that ghost was killed with vague clues that are limited to randomly drawn cards with pictures. The concept is great, but the mechanics of this abstract thought game ruin the fun almost immediately.If you want a frustrating almost senseless (not in the funny way) board game experience, get Mysterium. If you want an abstract game done right, get Dixit.

Everyone wins or loses together.-Great for large groups, we had exactly 7 people and this was the game we played every night.-Well constructed game.Cons:-Ghost character does not get to participate in as much of the side chatter throughout the game.-Clipping together the clock was actually really difficult for us. The plastic piece is made to tightly bind the thick cardboard bits together and a lot of pressure was required to snap it into place.-Best played with a large group of people - I'd say 4 or more.

  We are a family of board game lovers, unfortunately most board games for a older audience can take up to 3+ hrs to play one game. *couch* *couch* Arkem Horror.I loved the idea of this game and begged my husband to let me have it. We ended up trying it out with a few friends one night and went through a couple rounds in about under 2ish hours (factoring in the time it takes to set up and read/learn the rules and become familiar enough to play) It was a straightforward and rather simple game, with a few hair pulling/hysterical moments thrown in. I especially loved the character that isn't allowed to speak a single word during the whole game, as my friends did as well, since I was that person, and I ""talk too much"".Either way, it's one of the quicker board games to play, but still has a little length to play. Would recommend definitely.

Dixit meets Clue

  We've been under quarantine from the coronavirus for a few days, so this game came at the most opportune time. I do recommend this game be played with someone who has already played it acting as the ""ghost."" The game is not difficult to learn but the wording on the instructions can be a bit hard to descipher at times. The box was designed very well and there is a place for almost every game piece. No need for little bags to help organize the pieces. It helps to organize the cards back into numerical order at the end of each game to make the next game easier to start.BackgroundThe premise of the game is that a murder took place a long time ago and you are a group of psychics who have come to do a seance. You summon a ghost who can only speak to you in pictures and you have 7 rounds to investigate different suspects. Each suspect will lead you to a person, a location, and a weapon. If you correctly guess all the suspects within the 7 ""hours"" of the seance, the ghost will provide you with the final clues as to who the actual killer is.GameplayThis is pretty smooth and easy to understand/explain when playing as a psychic. The ghost is the one doing all the work and has to sit behind a screen. Have your strongest player be the ghost for the first round to hash it out. The game takes about 40 minutes and was easy for even beginner boardgame players to figure out how to play. When playing as 2 or 3 player games, check the very last page for instructions as to how many psychics for each player to play with.

Top game: surreal and mindbending - theatrical and immersive!

  Impressive coop game, really cool for a family game night! So, you're a ghost who communicates visions to ""psychic mediums"" using vision cards, and they have to determine who killed you, where you were killed, and with what weapon. Very ""Clue-like"", but so much cooler! To knock the experience out of the park, take 2 or 3 smart phones and stream the Mysterium music (or whatever epic music you like) for the game. The fact that they'll be playing slightly out of synch around you makes the experience that much more immersive!But back to the game. The designers put a lot into the artwork which is really surreal - definitely a high quality game. The vision cards are very dream-like. Each vision card has multiple elements so be careful not to mislead the psychics!The way it's set up you can really get into it and jazz up the experience to any theatrical degree.Definitely recommend!

  After waiting a few months for this game, I've finally managed to play it three times in two weeks. I've played it with serious gamers, my wife and our mothers, and with teens. Each group had a good time.I won't summarize the rules, because that's easy enough to find elsewhere (like from the publisher's site):http://en.libellud.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=callelement&format=raw&item_id=1523&element=66b58ffc-c789-4cef-b9f1-2cb5226ebace&method=download&args[0]=4ba51578946c33ff9c21a9f248c5214f&Itemid=57What I will comment on is that this game really shines in one spectacular way: the mechanism (symbol matching), matches the story (the players are psychics, trying to communicate with a ghost). You see, the ghost player is forced to communicate with a limited number of images, and the players, well, they almost have to be psychic to figure out what the ghost is trying to say!Why does my review score it with 4 stars? If you examine the theme too closely, it kind of falls apart. During the game, each player is solving a different mystery, but the ghost is only interested on one; his own death. This is easily fixed by saying that the ghost is confused, and needs help remembering from the psychics/players.Another problem is with gaining clairvoyant points which help with the end game. In a large game, it is VERY difficult to get enough of them. You might want to follow the rules for 3-5 players if you are playing with a larger group.Don't let my quibbles deter you. This is a very good game, and I'm glad to have it in my collection.

  I loved this game. It's very very beautifull, cards are awsome, and the game is easy and interisting.  Even my mother and friends who have never played boardgames could easily learn and play at the first time. It's very simple but also entertaining. The most dificult part is to be the ghost, so you better let someone who has already played be the Ghost if it's your first time. Even who doesnt really like Dix It (wich is a similar game), likes Mysterium a lot. They say Mysterium is a Dix It with a purpose, and prefer this game for this reason...because they feel there's a point to play it, cause you have a main goal.The only thing is that some cards (just a few) may be easily connected to the other. Like the Magician (suspect card) can be easily related to a  vision card that is full of rabbits. Maybe this happened to me because I played a lot of times with same persons. I played it a lot since I bought and I felt like buying the expansion already.And.... : if you know the Dix It mechanism of playing,you have meeples and a pointing board you might even play Dix It just with Mysterium cards!

Great team game; similar to Clue, but with a refreshingly new concept...
","

  Although the rules seemed lengthy and confusing, once we ran through the game once, we picked it up fairly quickly for the second round. (It might also help that we watched Wil Wheaton's Tabletop run-through on YouTube.) It's similar to Clue, except you don't talk back and forth or write anything down. There's been a murder, and one player plays as the Ghost, who is trying to give picture clues to the clairvoyant/psychic guests(the other players) to determine WHO killed you, in what ROOM, and with what OBJECT. As one of the psychics, you're trying to guess who/where/what by (hopefully) picking up on the right details in the clue cards the Ghost gives you each round. This is a team game; the psychics all vote on which who/where/what scenario (of 3) they think is the right one, and if they all get it right, they win. If they don't all guess the same way, they lose and the ghost remains unavenged.

  I enjoy this game, and appreciate the cooperative concept, but the ghost is lonely (I sometimes add an ""assistant"").  The players are generally bored waiting for the visions to be chosen, and the ghost can get frustrated with the small sample of vision cards available (can get stuck with useless cards for a long time).  With some modifications, we've made this a fun game to play.  No reading required so good for younger players as well.

  The artwork and detail is just wonderful in this game. To keep track of turns in the games, rather than doing just a timer or checkbox, they actually have a tiny clock that you put together, and player tokens are tiny crystal balls. The ghost can also ""dump"" cards and marks the times they do so with little tokens in the shape of ravens, and each raven is different. Just wonderful detail and spooky atmosphere.The gameplay is solid. It's like a supernatural mix of Dixit and Clue. We already have played this several times since getting it, and it's become a real winner. Much easier to learn than, say Arkham Horror, but still very fun.We haven't gotten to the point that it's been a problem, but the only potential problem is replay value. We already have some in-jokes worked around the cards, which can impact future games.Still well worth the money!

  Art is lovely. Card and component quality is good. Gameplay is fun, although I had 1 player in 1 of my 3 groups describe it as ""a bit slow"". The theme worked well. It's important that people who have not played the Ghost before understand how sometimes the Ghost's hands are tied and they just don't have great cards to play for a particular player; we had a couple times where players eviscerated the Ghost for handing out confusing clues, but they didn't understand that the Ghost was caught in a bad situation and only had 1 or no Crows left for the entire game; again, not a problem if players understand up front. Replayability is moderate, each game is more or less like the last, and even though the deck is huge you do start seeing the same cards popping up pretty regularly (the expansion helps with this), but you can adjust difficulty for added difficulty.

One of the best games I have ever played
","

  This is such a cool game. The game basically features a ghost and a number of psychics. The ghosts job is to send visions to the psychics, who then have to pick a person, place, and murder weapon from the clues in the vision. The best part is that this game is cooperative, so your ultra competitive friend who likes to hide monopoly money in her pockets doesn't gloat for a week when she wins. That's right, Sandra, I'm calling you out.A few things to know before you buy:-Learning this game can take some time. It is a lot to setup, and there are a lot of rules to be aware of. It includes instructions, obviously, but I also recommend finding a Youtube video online describing how to play. There is also a mobile app version of this game that holds your hand as you learn; it costs a few dollars but you get to play Mysterium on the go! Worth it!-This game takes up space. A lot of space. Be prepared.-Putting everything back in the box isn't as straightforward as you would thing. Pay attention to what goes where, you'll thank me later.

Great Conversation Game
","

  This game has been a blast. The asymmetric gameplay of one player as the ghost and the others as the team of psychics is a pleasurable experience for both sides.The cards and pictures that are used to give clues are wild and crazy depictions of dreams that really offer a lot to digest, discuss, and depict. It creates a lot of fun dialog about if the ghost is trying to be literal with a clue or if they had to really stretch to have something to give.  As the ghost, its a laugh to listen to how the psychics try to analyze and critique your clues.Gameplay is simple repetitive mechanic of ghost giving clues and then psychics deciphering clues, but it makes for a simple to learn experience that is great for many new players. The discussions are timed so it keeps things moving at a nice pace. As stated the cards are wildly unique and the mix of weapons, places, and whodunits is varied that every gameplay experience will be different though mechanics are always similar.The only drawback is the game is best played with 3-7. It's way more fun with multiple people conversing and discussing on the psychics side. Playing with 2, though still fun, isn't quite the same experience.It's a great game as an opening act for a game night with friends.  Even if you're an experienced board game player, this is a great title that can always be used as a starter game since its light in mechanics but still offers a lot of variety and uniqueness to each play-through.

Not bad but there are other collaboration games I prefer.
","

  Played it in a small group a few times to try it. Learning takes a minute but is manageable. The best part of the game is one person trying to think like you do and giving you a card with an eclectic picture, hoping you see the same things they focused on. Then they watch as you end up focusing on everything but the one thing they anticipated you would see. The hope drains from their eyes as you talk about a teeny detail they hadn't even noticed, and completely miss the clue that they were so desperately trying to give to you. They are the ghost and must be silent, despite their stifled laughter as they watch you flail like an idiot against the timer.The whole game could just be that. Eventually we didn't really bother with the set up and buildable clocks that only added so much to the game.

Super fun
","

  This game is so much fun with a big group of people. Initially learning the game was difficult since none of us had played before and there are a lot of rules, but once you get the gist of it, it's easy to toss out some of the more confusing rules and just play the game. The main idea is that one person is the ghost and sends visions to the other players to help them figure out who killed them, where they were killed, and what weapon was used.  I've been told it is similar to Clue although I haven't played that myself.

Super engaging game that creates conversation
","

  We just discovered this game around Christmas, and have played it constantly with tons of our friends and family. My wife loves being the Ghost and handing out clues. It's gotten more play than most of our other games these past six months--so much so that we just bought one of the expansions. Art is beautiful, the game is simple for teaching to new players (so long as they're mediums the first time and not the ghost), and the fact that it's a collaborative game rather than a competitive one is a HUGE plus. I'd highly recommend this one.

Fun, but certainly not the best game
","

  This game is fine and it was a new addition to our massive board game collection. We love non-mainstream games like Power Grid, Settlers of Catan, 7 Wonders, etc.Overall, this wasn't anywhere near the best game we've ever played but certainly isn't the worst. It has a long set up and is, at times, almost too difficult to be fun. Perhaps that's just a side effect of the person we have playing the ""Ghost"" but the cards sometimes are too nondescript and make it hard to understand what the card is trying to clue us into.

  It's like Clue on a mild acid trip. Trying to interpret the clues leads to some of the most amazing and off-the-wall theories (some of which actually turn out to be right). This is a great game to play with friends whose trains of thought you can kind of grasp, but might be a little more difficult if the person playing the ghost is someone you don't know very well. I absolutely love it and would recommend to anyone looking for an entertaining board game.

Great aesthetics, Gameplay is a little weak.
","

  The game is basically a mash up of Dixit and Codenames. If your group loves both,, you will probably love Mysterium. The aesthetics are beautiful. The artwork is top notch, and the game pieces are very well made, definitely one of the best set of game pieces I've owned in the last few months for me.The biggest hinderance to a full 5 star rating is the set up time required, and the overall flow of the game. In regards to game time: it takes an inordinate amount of time to set up a game, compared to the time it takes to play. My group found it takes 5-10 minutes to set a game up, whereas it takes about 20 minutes to play. You spend nearly a third of your time just setting up a game, which in my mind, is ridiculous. Compare it to any of your other favorite games, and see just how much set up time is required. Furthermore, the game itself is hard to feel challenging, and the flow feels a bit off. There's the weird final round of guessing, where if everyone gets their correct set of suspect/location/weapon correct, you have to pick one and see if you can get the whole group to agree one last time. It feels like it was added just to pad out the game. It doesn't feel like a grand finale at the end, but rather a whimper of formality.

Beautifully surreal and calculatedly inscrutable fun
","

  What a game! It's ""Clue"", only upgraded to a higher level of social interaction and possessing creatively asymmetrical cooperation. The role of the player being the ghost is quite unique, and possibly a reason onto itself for purchasing the game. Everyone should play as the ghost at least once, what an experience. And the artwork! Beautifully surreal and calculatedly inscrutable. When set up on the table with the ghost's large screen, the clock, the sand-glass timer, the cards, and all its other bits; it really looks quite wonderful. But the best is how social a game it is: everyone constantly wondering and hinting and laughing, and yes, even bickering about what the hell the ghost could possibly be hinting at. And that doesn't end when the game does. Our impromptu postmortems with the ghost :) after the game are just as much fun as the game-play itself. Very enjoyable.

Narrow Audience
","

  Most people I have played with moderately enjoy this game (more so when they play as the ghost).  It is hard/unenjoyable for those who have a hard time grasping abstract ideas (my husband and my father).  It lends itself to fanfare, setting the theme with music and roleplaying which, I'm told, makes it much more fun.  A little too narrow of an audience for most gaming groups.

Terrific, cooperative game
","

  This is one of the most fun games my family has played. My youngest is six and was able to participate, but it's not so easy that adult players grow bored. The difficulty of the game really does rely on the ability of the ghost to convey the visions to the psychic well enough to move to the next challenge. I also love that it's a game where the players have to cooperate and play as a team instead of playing against each other (we have some younger, sore losers at times). The artwork is really outstanding, and I can see this becoming an immediate favorite for our game nights.

Love this game

  Love this game, it is a great game if you prefer a board game where you work collectively together. One person ""guides"" the group as a ghost and and the others are clairvoyants and the ghost is trying to tell them how they died. It is similar to Clue but you all are trying to help one another. It is a collective game that is really fun both as a clairvoyant and the ghost. Low competitive game so if you have friends/family that don't like strategy games that pit people against each other consider getting this game. Beautiful board and game pieces which is an added bonus.

For us, it just didn't make sense how they wanted you to play the game.  After spending another day tweaking the instructions to fit our needs, we had a blast!

  Trying to communicate with abstract ""visions"" is surprisingly difficult; this game stays challenging after dozens of plays. It's simple enough you can explain it to anyone fairly quickly, plus everyone working together makes it easier to bring a newcomer up to speed. It requires some real thought and discussion without being complicated. Overall, the most consistently fun board game I've played.

  This is a type of new age Clue. The theme works really well, and with it being a Co-Op game the experience is much more satisfying than Clue. The Ghost Mechanics can be a bit daunting and there are many moving parts to that role, but the game is satisfying and fun to play with people of all levels of depth playing board games. I've played it with people who strongly dislike board games and it's quickly taken to them and got them pulled right into the experience with the group. This game is a must have for anyone's game closet.

  Well worth the money, super fun game once you learn how to play. I would suggest you take the time to watch on youtube how to play this if you run into difficulty.  My wife and I had never played a major board game in our lives and thoroughly enjoy this game. The game's play time depends on how many people are present. For 2 people it can range anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes. Whenever we are bored we pop this game up and it is a certified boredom crusher.

  Mysterium is one of my favorite games.It is a great game if you are looking for a game that is fun to play at a gathering, where you want to spend time with people, without going to in depth with a board game that requires a lot of attention.I find this game is popular both with friends who are not used to playing board games, and with friends who play a variety of board games.It is a mix of Dlue meets Dixit in a co-op version of those games.Nice components, beautiful artwork, and just all in all a really great game.

  This game is 100 percent cooperative, so if you do not like that in a board game, you will not like this. One player plays as a ghost who gives out picture cards to the other players. Using those cards the players are suppose to guess who, what, and where a murder happened. I have enjoyed this the few times I have played it, but I could see it being too easy with someone you know too well. I really liked playing as the ghost and listening to the discussions on why I gave individual cards. It’s kind of funny to hear someone on the right path, and then go completely off in a different direction.

Good game for your collection but something is missing
","

  This game is okay. We played this game many of times and everyone thinks they can be the best ghost until it is their turn and they are frustrated with their options. This game plays like clue almost where you are trying to guide people with cards to figure out the murder suspect, location, and weapon by only using random abstract cards that tend to have very little in common with such suspect location and clue. We found it a fairly cooperative game and fairly enjoyable but I am rating it 4/5 because we felt like the game just missed something... but overall still great game and we will revisit this in the future

  I've never ordered a product based on a facebook ad before but this game changed that.  It looked challenging and fun for the whole family.

Just make sure you have enough space to spread out for some of the challenges.

  We still have and play the original Mall Madness all the time so the anticipation level for this was high. It’s still fun and the male out of stock voice is hilarious. However, it is set to be done after 6 stores (which only lasts about 15 minutes) so you are restricted to a quick game. Also, after playing for only a couple of days, the cardboard store list is already a little damaged from the marker pieces.FYI, like many other reviewers, I thought it was broken even after trying multiple batteries. Turns out, you have to hold down the celebration side button, not the center button as the diagram shows.

  this was my favorite childhood game. My sister bought this for my birthday. She lives out of state so I have resorted to playing with my three year old. He loves it. The money number skills and space moving is great practice. The game is practically the same but here are my complaints: (note I have only played as a 2 player game) the game seems to go very quickly the electronic system has us going to atm like every 3rd to 4th turn so you never run out of money, it also gives us large amounts of spaces to move, so like every turn you can buy something. The game setup takes forever, i wish the store signs stayed put but they always fall out and I haven't figured out how to put game away without removing the top store signs. The game has black markers to k keep track of what stores you have been to, they tear up the cardboard boards. I wish the credit cards were plastic because the cardboard bends and gets destroyed.  Overall, still happy to have this game.

Poorly executed, no replay value for adults.
","

  This was a highly anticipated game for me, but didn't hit the mark. The premise is quiet simple, you move your ship towards the end goal with as much cargo, and as many people as you can. There are a few strategic things you can do, but the game itself is largely luck-based and the winner won't feel like they did anything to win. The jokes are all very funny if you're a Disney fan, but, a typical four player game goes through all the cards around 3/4 times, so they get old and repetitive. The mechanics of the game are worn out in the first 3rd of the game, and there's nothing interesting on the board to run into.The only value I can see is a good introduction as a middle ground between typical family games and more strategy games for young adults and up - this is what you'd play between monopoly and Catan to get your 12-14 year old child introduced to more complicated games. Too many moving parts for those younger.I really wanted to like it but doubt we'll ever play again.

  So listen. If your an avid board game player this game might seem dull. I happen to enjoy the nostalgia of the art and theme more than the actual gameplay. If your looking for a massive epic game this isn’t it. If you want the Disney experience and the funny puns, get it. Unlike other reviews I see replay ability with it. And yes the dice are supposed to look dirty.

Fun and Follows the Ride
","

  This was actually very fun.  I bought it because I'm a big Disney fan and Jungle Cruise is one of my favorite rides.  Its a little confusing with so many directions but once you get it down, it's fun.  Basically you have a boat full of passengers and you collect cargo and lose passengers along the ride route and when you get to the end, you count up to see who kept more on the boat.  The cards have the skippers jokes on them.  The game it's self is very high quality.  No cheap  flimsy pieces.  It's a solid game.

Fun and funny entry level strategy game.
","

  The game has some very strong elements.  The board is well crafted and sturdy.  The art style and layout is very true to the ride.  The puns and jokes, for fans of the namesake ride, are spot on.  I agree with other reviews that the jokes can get repetetive on multiple playthroughs, but if you've been on the ride more than a few times you've heard them all anyway.  They are charmingly stupid jokes, and it's just fun to roll your eyes and go with it.Set-up is quick but there are quite a few pieces to track.  Gameplay seems more complicated than it really is initially, but once you get the flow you can start to develop something akin to a strategy.  If you are a fan of the awesome Villainous series of games by the same company, this doesn't approach that level of strategy or complexity.  My 7 almost 8 year old started to get the hang of the game after a few turns.Overall a fun little game.  Not something I'll play all the time, but it is one I'll bust out once in a while when I need a stupid laugh or want to experience the silliness of the ride from home.

Fun game with a disney theme
","

  Like many games once everyone knows the rules it is pretty straight forward, you should understand most of the rules after your first play through, if you have any experience with other strategy board games.It is fun with just enough strategy, the passengers that are worth the most points changes each game and is a mystery to the players early and based off of your luck with rolling die helps to lead you in the direction of trying to maintain your passangers on board or if going for sets of cargo makes more sense.Overall I see enough replay value for us to enjoy this for a while, you do go through the jokes after the first game, but they are lightharted and themed to the jungle cruise ride, some of which I have heard in person on the ride.

A bit of a disappointment for Ravensberger.
","

  I am a Disney fanatic.  And when I heard that Disney was making another film based on a theme park ride, it was a no-brainer ordering this game.  Ravensberger is an excellent company and to date, I have never really been disappointed with anything that they've produced.Many people will say that a game based on some kind of intellectual property is doomed from the start.  I must disagree.  I have purchased Jaws and Jurassic Park, both made by this same company and have been delighted to see the integration of the theme into the game.  It's always refreshing to see how little nuances in the plot of the film make their way into the mechanics of a board game.  And, after reading through the rules and watching the video on youtube, the premise of this game sounded like another home-run.The problem though is that the game mechanics become worn out very quickly and at a certain point, everyone just wants it to end.  The repetition of drawing hazard cards and dealing with them EVERY SINGLE TURN is the idea that brings this game to a screeching stop.  I am very surprised that play testers didn't say the same thing.  It sounded great when I read the rules, but when you actually start to play, it gets old very quickly.The quality of the components are top-notch and I wanted to love this game.  Although I will keep it in my collection, I do so only because of what it is themed after.  I will only be able to use this with nieces and nephews - they won't complain about the repetitive nature of it (I hope!).I still place Ravensberger on a pedestal.  I forgive them for this atrocity.  I gave it two stars because the game components are amazing.  If you are looking for an entertaining game to play with people your own age, don't buy this!

  My husband and I have friends we love to have game nights with, and while we usually opt for more strategic and in-depth stuff, this is a great game to pass time with. It's very simple to learn, super easy to play, and if your love for Disney is anything like mine, you'll enjoy the jokes on the cards and artwork! It's not a game we will want to whip out every game night, and we may not play it super often, I still feel like it has a space on your board game shelf. I feel like Disney kids could also grasp the concept easily, and would be a great family game.Even if your family isn't Disney obsessed, I still think it's a great game to get introduced into board games. If your a hardcore gaming group looking for something to add, I doubt this game would be for you (if you are a hardcore group, and love Disney, check out Villainous.)Recommended by me! And I look forward to the new Haunted Mansion game coming out later this year.

  This game is simple enough to learn and the concept is unique enough to not feel boring or overdone. Really enjoyable for my family, some of whom were previously Skippers. My Skipper family members wonder if the people who worked on the writing in this game are also “retired” Skippers based on style and certain sentiments in the rules. It really seems like the writers knew their stuff about the ride this game is based off of.We also have the Ravensburger Jurassic Park and Jaws games and those are both also really enjoyable. It seems like Ravensburger always does a great job of making games that are unique and vastly different than other games in our collection.If I was told I had to make one change to this game, it would be the same change I’d make to many of my favorites; I’d love to be able to play with more than four players without having to do “teams” or having someone sit out until the next round.

  We preordered this game, really excited for it after loving Villainous and craving more Disney fun. It didn’t disappoint. It has the right objective to make it “feel” like the jungle cruise, and even has classic jungle cruise jokes and puns throughout the game.We felt it was very easy to learn, even for kids. It has a simple mystery aspect like Clue and simple dice rolling/card drafting to avoid the perils of the river. There are different strategies to employ, but really you could just go through the motions and still have a shot at winning. It’s all the luck of the dice.We thought the materials were very high quality. The dice especially are weighted nicely and even appear like they were found on the Jungle Cruise which is fun!All in all it’s well worth the price and something we will always enjoy playing when Disney fever sets in.

  It's a new family favorite, fun and easy to learn. Even our five year old grandkids can get it and they often win even when we try to beat them. Strategy is simple and it isn't just roll and go like most kid games. I worked at the attraction myself for 17 years so I know most of the jokes, but there were some that even made me laugh having not heard them all. I was disappointed that most of the jokes are repeated at least twice in the deck (and it's a huge deck) when there are so many jokes they could have included from 50 yrs of Jungle Cruises. Still now my whole family wants their own copies but they are sold out everywhere so fast. Get yours if you can.

  The game looks like it could be pretty fun, we took it out last night to play with the family. There are so many moving parts that and chills just gave up.

So for a Disney game meant for family, this gives out a very confusing vibe.

I played with a group of 4 people who just wanted to play games and have fun. It was hilarious, because we were so interested in slapping NOT LAST that we were slamming the table too hard. Some cards require actions before you slap the cards like beating your chest or the table first. We would go too hard at the start until we realized that it's not how hard you slap, it's how fast.Players who were not as good at card recognition fell behind. Some of the cards are coloured differently to try and throw you off. It's not who slaps first, but who slaps last, so you just have to be faster than one friend. I can see how playing this with boring people who are too serious could really put a cramp on it's style.

  Beware of slapped hands :-) What a fun somewhat physical card game. Simple game to learn and our 10yr old loves it.  Rules are simple: If spoken word from player matches the card played everyone slaps the stack of cards, last one has to take all the cards in the pile.  Although this can be fun for all ages, I think the sweet spot is 8-12yrs. With so many dumb kids ""board games"" out there, this is a game that as a parent I don't mind playing over and over. It can at times feel a bit like the card game War where it can drag on at times but if played strictly by the rules it can go pretty quick.

Just be advised that after a few games you'll want to move on to something else with more depth.  But this is great for what it is!

Fun but dangerous!

  We got this for our 9 year old daughter for her birthday. While she was upstairs playing with her new gifts, my husband and I decided to try this game out. Well to our surprise it was so much fun, a tad frustrating because you get competitive and want to win! It got violent though, my watch thought I had taken a hard fall and needed SOS! lol #facepalm It might be a bit too rough for our daughter, but maybe we just need to tone down the competitiveness when playing with her! We like it!*update. Our daughter loves it too! Great family game all around! Can be played as a two player, but the more people you have the more fun it becomes!

Fun, interactive card game
","

  We love this game!  I got it with my eight year old in mind but we were able to teach our four year old too.  Basically you each take turns flipping over cards and saying the words in order (first person says “taco” when they flip a card, next person says “cat” etc.) regardless of the card you flip.  So if you’re first you say “taco” even if that does not match the card you actually turn over. In the case that what a player says does match the card they flip, everyone must race to put their hands on top of the pile.  Last player to do so takes all the cards.  Object is to get rid of your cards.  There are silly special cards here and there which require you to all do a silly movement first. I would say a six year old or older could play.  Like I said, our four year old could figure out the rules, but she was slow to get her hand to the pile which got frustrating.  Fun game for on the go and even adults can have fun with it.

Unbelievable Fun
","

  I was looking for a game that would be quick to play, keep everyone's attention, and be able to be played with a diverse group of players.  Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza fits the bill perfectly!  We opened up the box of cards, read the instructions, and were off to great fun.  It is so silly that elementary kids find it a delight.  It is so fun that adults laugh over how ridiculous it is. (I hope you can understand that this is a good thing.)  The game is great good clean fun. A game lasts around 15 minutes; it's a great party game. I would say that the game is good for ages 8-55, too much younger and they won't grasp the concept, too much older and it will be too silly or physically tasking.

  This game is hilarious! I gave it to my nephew for his 11th birthday. We were able to start playing within moments of opening the deck and reading the directions. There were five of us, two kids and three adults. We laughed so hard we couldn’t stop!To play the game, you go around the table each saying one of the words taco, cat, goat, cheese, pizza in sequence and throw down a card. If the card matches the word just said, everyone has to slap the card. The last hand to slap, has to take the deck. To add to the fun there are special cards: gorilla, groundhog and narwhal. For these you have to pound your chest like a gorilla, knock on the table or clap your hands above your head before slapping your hand on the card.One word of warning...the game can get a little rough during the slap down, so rings off and nails clipped!

Fun Game, Mediocre Quality
","

  The game is fun to play with a group of 4 or more people.  My kids are 7, 6, and 4 and the two older ones didn't have any problems picking it up.  Just a note, if you're playing with kids, try playing first without the Gorilla, Groundhog, and Narwhal, and then add them in as the kids understand the game better,My only gripe was with the quality of the cards.  The artwork while unspectacular, is nice.  Buit for a game that has so much physical action involved in it, I would've hoped that the maker would have sprung for better quality cards.

Holds up to even the biggest of messes!

  I buy a new game for each of my kids every December and we play them as our advent activities.  This one had so many 5 star reviews, I knew we had to give it a try.It is so easy and quick to learn, it takes about 2 minutes to read the whole rules, and 1 minute to explain them.  The deck says it's for 2-4 players, but we have 5 people, and just dealt out less cards.  We will be buying another deck, though, so that we can play with lots of friends.Besides how fun this game is to play, my biggest complement is how they held up to the biggest mess we've ever made just playing cards as a family.  DD just couldn't contain her laughter, and Christmas punch was spit all over her stack of cards!  After laughing as a family for a few seconds at the ridiculousness, we quickly got the cards under some water, and then let them sit out to dry.  Luckily she was close to winning and had only 8 cards left.  I figured these cards were ruined.  BUT I was wrong!  They dried just fine, and only 2 of them have a little waviness on a corner.  In the whole scheme of how the game is played, two marked cards aren't going to make a huge difference.We highly recommend this one!

Super fun with adults, two 6th graders, and 1 8th grader

  I had so much fun playing this game with my nephews and friend last night (ages 12-32). we're all pretty competitive, so we played pretty fiercely (a little blood on your knuckles from the action of 'knocking on the table' is normal, right??). It was a great mix of easy to learn without being too simple. The game comes with quite good directions, but I'll summarize, in case it helps anyone to make a decision...-Divide the entire deck between players-cards stay face down in front of you & you win by getting rid of all of your cards-one at a time, each player flips over a card in the center while saying 'goat, cat, etc' (always the same order listed in the game title)-when the word aloud matches the flipped card (saying and seeing cat, for example), everyone slaps the middle pile- slowest person has to add those cards to their own stack-there are a few different types of action cards, like gorilla, and when a gorilla card randomly pops up, you have to beat on your chest and then slap the pile (again, don't be the slowest or you get stuck with the pile). The action cards, especially, created a lot of laughs!If we didn't know who was slowest to slap the pile, we usually did rock, paper, scissors between the two most likely suspects. Most of the time, we knew and confessed to being the slowest and took the middle stack of cards so we could keep the game going. It was a bonus that you had to pay attention or you usually got stuck with extra cards- kept the tempo of the game high without the normal pauses of people checking their phone or getting a snack. Every time my mind wandered, I got stuck with extra cards, much to the delight of my nephews. Can't blame them- teenagers aren't the only ones who get distracted! ;)After the first night of trying this game, I feel like I've gotten my money's worth already. Two thumbs up!!

  I have now bought 4 copies of this game--one for myself and 3 for extended family members. Everyone loves it! One family uses it with their adult children (ages 18-27), one family with teenagers and special needs kids (ages 18-10), and my older kids (13-5) all love it. The younger kids are obviously a bit slower with their reactions, but it's a game that adults can play with kids or other adults and still enjoy (unlike most games for kids--I'm looking at you Candy Land!). My kids will even take it to their friends' houses and play with them. I love that it's a game kids can play with other kids, or adults with other adults. That's rare. Plus the hours of laughing at my brother-in-law as he curses the narwhal cards were well worth the $10 for this game.

A MUST HAVE card game

  I was looking for a new card game to play with the family, especially one that our 8 year old boy could play. I saw the reviews for this product and the high star rating. For ten dollars, I figured I would give it a go. I am glad I did. This game is so much fun! It is very easy to learn and silly at the same time. Expect people getting loud, laughing, and so forth. Our boy requests playing this game often. I believe some of the motions for special cards played was a genius move to not only add variety, but it keeps young players engaged. You never know when the gorilla or groundhog card, for example, will appear and require you to react a certain way to get rid of the cards. Highly recommend it. If you have a rather large gathering (6+ players), you may want to buy two decks so you have enough to go around. I have done 8 players on one deck, but it would have been more enjoyable to have more cards as you need to distribute all cards from one deck. Hence combining two decks will give players more cards. Anyway, grab this fun and silly game!

  I purchased the card f game for my son and I. I read in the Q&A that it works for two players.Nope.It was gifted from “Santa” to my son on our late Xmas late January.The box says right on it, 3-8 players.I fault myself for not zooming in on the pictures.However, it is misleading. The description does not mention how many players are needed. Therefore, I noticed the question was asked in the Q&A, and went by that advice rather then scrolling through pictures.Bad idea. Because I gifted so long after purchasing, then it took weeks to find time to play, it wasn’t until recently I learned it is useless for us. It was a splurge because my son wanted to be a Taco cat” for halloween, and is known for his taco cat sweatshirt.Now it is too late to return and I am in no position to waste money.

  Really no learning curve - get right into playing and slapping, and interestingly enough, making odd noises! There are no odd noises to be made per the rules, but people can't seem to help themselves!  There are a few special cards that require you to do an action before you slap the cards.  This is apparently very difficult to remember and people do all sorts of things trying to remember the correct move.  As part of they (me too!) make goofy animal noises - especially gorilla like sounds.  It's hysterical.Painful because as you are all slapping your hands down someone can jam a finger, get hit by someone's sharp nail, etc...  Still very funny!

  Very easy to learn, you can leave out the 3 ""action"" cards in the deck until you really learn the game and add them in one at a time to make it easier.  Easy to transport for vacation- simply a deck of cards. How to play: lay out a card, you have to say TACO- whether your card IS a picture of a taco or not. You have 5 words that have to be said in order each time someone lays down a card. The trick is that your eyes see a PIZZA, but you may have to say GOAT because that was the next word in order.  If you lay out a GOAT and the word list happens to be on GOAT- slap the deck first to give those cards to your opponent because the objective is, to give away all your cards.  There are 3 different ACTION cards that make the game even more challenging. You may be saying, PIZZA but the ACTION card says to clap. Everyone has to do the ACTION and then slap the deck- last one to slap? Gets all the cards.  Very, very fun game. The videos did not explain it very well which is why I wrote this post.

  This game is addictive, fun, easy to learn, yet challenging!  I introduced it yesterday and we played several rounds.  There is just enough of a challenge that even if you have played before, it takes concentration and focus to win.  Great for most ages, but I wouldn't recommend adults play with small children simply because they may get hurt if the pile slap is too hard and the little one's hand is on the bottom.I love how the makers creatively used color and artistic license to make the cards harder to distinguish at first glance.  Flinchers beware!  There's also a suitable sized deck to allow for variation in the cards.  This is one of our new family favorites for quick games and take along games.

  I purchased this game for my 9 year old niece for her birthday.  I had never heard of this game before, but the reviews were great so I thought I would give it a try.  As soon as she opened it she was pumped.  Apparently, she had recently played it for the first time at a friend's house.  We immediately opened it up and she taught us how to play (we also read the easy-to-follow directions to be sure).  There were five of us playing, four adults and the 9 year old.  We had the BEST time!  It is a fast paced and silly game.  I would recommend putting a towel on the table where you are laying the cards because as others have noted, your hand will start to hurt slapping the table/counter too hard over and over.  We will be purchasing this game for our own adult game night.  Highly recommend.

We had some great games this year but for simplicity (this is an out-of-the-box, 5-seconds-later-you're-playing kind of game) and fun (even with 3 players it's fun, but this truly is a More the Merrier kind of game) Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza got the most laughs and the most straight-up fun.

  My family loves this game! It's easy to learn, fun to play, and really gets the giggles going. When our barely-four-year-old plays, she just spreads her cards on the table face+up and chooses a match when it's her turn, then delights in slapping down the cards and making the motions. Our almost-six-year-old plays by the rules, but he sometimes needs reminding of what word we're on at his turn. All the kids older than that have no trouble whatsoever, and it can get really fast-paced, with fun, unexpected consequences.Note: we have a little child-size table that fits four perfectly and let's everyone reach the slap pile equally. I can't imagine more than five or maybe six people playing at once because of the physical requirements. It would be too crowded.

  I have two kids: 16 year old son and almost 10 year old daughter. Getting together to do family things is challenging. Having a teen and pre-teen the kids have their own things going on. So when I come across a card game that everyone enjoys and are willing to stop and play as a family, that’s a win in my book! We had a blast and those 3 special cards made it that much more fun. It takes a little bit of time to get into the rhythm and we found ourselves messing up after someone had to take the pile. We’d completely forget which word we were on, but we just thought that was funny and picked a spot to begin again. You’ll get faster - and if you don’t you’ll be the one with the pile at the end. :)

Fun Game -- If you don't mind being slapped
","

  This is a simple card game. All the cards are distributed evenly among the players. Each player, in turn, says the next word in the sequence (taco, cat, goat, cheese, pizza) and flips the top card of their deck onto a pile in the middle of the players. If the card matches the word, everyone slams their hand onto the pile; the last one to get their hand in place takes all the cards. There are three special cards (gorilla, narwhal, and groundhog) that require you to perform an action with your hands before slapping the pile. Again, the last person to slap the pile takes all the cards. If you flinch toward the pile or perform the wrong action for the special cards, you have to take the pile. The game ends when someone has no cards left in their deck and is first to slap the pile at the next opportunity.Pros: Easy to learn. You'll laugh a lot as you play it. The motions for the special cards are goofy. Families can play it together.Cons: Your hand *will* get slapped, and you might be scratched by fingernails. If you're playing with a competitive group, the likelihood of minor pain goes up. This game rewards players with sharp eyesight and fast reflexes. There is no strategy and not much replayability.The game is a decent value for the money, you can play it with kids, and it will be fun the first few times. After that, you're likely to leave this one on the shelf and only bring it out occasionally. And there's nothing wrong with that.

Not for Everyone

  This game is fun but is very hard for older folks to do. If you wear bifocals or readers it's hard to see picture on card in middle until it's too late. I'm a senior and ended up with the whole deck practically! Was very hard to see and quickly hit the pile. So if you want grandma and grandpa to play, you may want to pick another card game!It's definitely for younger players.  But even my grandchildren who are teenagers did not like it, maybe preteens or younger might like it.

  Wanna slap the sh*t outta your friends!?Got some some aggression or an urge to never be a loser?This is the game for you.Super easy to learn and can be quite enjoyable to play. I bought this for my friends and family once Exploding Kittens was worn out. This game has brought out some demons in my kids especially about the rules. No flinching! Make sure you're the quickest! Most importantly don't mess up the tempo of the game play. The 3 speciality cards that pop up are hilarious and keep the game interesting. I must know the most competitive people because we are all really into this game and have no mercy. We have drawn blood from time to time trying to slap the fastest & sometimes hardest in the thrill of the game. It's hilarious and doesn't have to be intense, but come on, it's much better that way.

  I play this with young children, tweens, and teens all at the same time. The first time we played; (Parental torture... the beginning of any forced family time) First we did the you're playing get over it, I know your life is ruined because I turned off your xbox, you can't go online, play with your dolls, watch netflix, make a mud pie, return those life and death texts drama. Then came the I'm not sitting by so and so blah, blah , blah madness which led to name calling chaos. Next thing you know I'm sitting at a table with a bunch of sullen bratty children with mutiny in their eyes because I asked (I tried), told (yeah because that always works), yelled (obviously not loud enough because I still didn't get their attention), screamed (ah blessed quiet) at them them to sit down and shut up. Then we actually started playing, big thumbs up for simple rules and game play... drum roll please.. after the first 5 to 10 minutes the grumblings and mumblings stopped. No more ""This game is boring, dumb, lame"" or other negative comments. They actually started laughing and enjoying themselves. Also, guess what... if I ask ""want to play TCGCP?"" they still grumble and moan but thats just for appearances so they don't lose their cool kid cred by actually expressing a positive emotion at playing a game with mom. I don't have to force them to play and BIGGEST SHOCKER of all, I've caught them playing it TOGETHER on their own, TOGETHER without me. This fun, hilarious, game is a big win for the whole family!!!

  I got this for my wife because her best friend said she liked it. It arrived at our house, we opened it, it took about 3 minutes to learn the game, and we started playing. We laughed the whole time, had a great time, & played a total of 5 times in one day!It has now been moved to our “always travels with us card games” box. It is fun, fast-paced, and one of the best card games that we have played as a family. If you like simple family games that pack tons of fun, this is a must buy game.

Inappropriate cards
","

  I bought this game as a gift for my 8 year old daughter who loves games.  I was expecting lots of gross foods--but I was surprised at the inappropriate cards--eyeball, human burger, blood salsa, and fresh brains.  Those are not foods that typical people find in their refrigerators.  We do not practice cannibalism.  She was very upset when I suggested that we just take out those cards.  I seriously wonder who thinks that those cards are appropriate for kids.  The rest of the game is funny, but I wish I would have looked through the cards before I gave it to her.

Quick and easy, great for families; see NOTE for box lid opening hack
","

  Taco vs Burrito plays a lot like Uno, but with funnier cards.  Much like Uno, you can sabotage your opponents, or be nice; whatever suits your playstyle.  You can totally play with only 2 players, but more people means more opportunities for mischief and mayhem!Pros:- easy to learn how to play (each Action card tells you how to use it)- setup and teardown are super simple (no dice or color-coded gamepieces to lose and step on later)- gameplay is quick and easy (10 min/game; no Monopoly marathons here!)- amusing food ingredients (creative/gross foods will give you a chuckle)- once you master the basic game, there are many variations that keep the game interesting- my 7-year-old does enjoy this game a lot, and I don't mind playing 1-on-1 (it's more strategic and exciting with more people)Cons:- the game box is ridiculously hard to open, for some reason.  See NOTE below for a quick hack fix.- I feel like there should be more ingredient cards. Perhaps that is what is in the expansion pack?- you choose to build either a taco or a burrito, but the choice does not affect gameplay *at all*. I feel like it should, though. If I think up a game variation that does, I'll post it here on a later edit.- considering you're basically just getting a pack of funny cards, I feel that $20 is a little expensive. I would have been fine with paying $15 or so.Bottom line: This game is easy to learn and fun to play. It's great for when you want to play one or a few quick games with family or friends. It would make a good gift, especially if you can get it on sale.NOTE: The game box lid creates a vacuum or something that makes the box really hard to open. So what I did was take  a square of clean aluminum foil (about 1 foot x 1 foot) and fold it over itself several times to make a strong strip roughly 1 foot long and 2 inches wide. Then place the strip horizontally *underneath the plastic tray* in the box (please see the attached photo). Tuck the leftover ends under the box bottom to hide the aluminum strip when the box is closed and in storage.When you want to open the box, just untuck the ends, balance the box on your leg (or have the other person hold it), and pull *downwards* on both of the ends of the aluminum strip *equally*. This downward motion will push the plastic tray upwards, and the lid will magically float up and pop off. You don't need to use a lot of force! Alternatively, you could just open the box normally, as the aluminum strip breaks the vacuum seal and makes it much easier, but where's the fun in that? :)If you found this review to be helpful, please click on the 'Helpful' button below so more people like you can find it. Thank you!

I laughed myself into an asthma attack!
","

  Ok, this game is legitimately hilarious, and devious enough to bring out people's competitive nature! It says a round is roughly 15 minutes, but we kept reshuffling the trash pile, so the round wound up being closer to 45.It's SUPER easy to play -- you literally deal the cards and start playing because instructions are written on the cards themselves. We had a few scenarios where we had to adapt as the game went on, namely with the ""Food Fight"" action card. The deck has so many action cards that it was hard to draw ingredient cards for the Food Fight, so we decided that action cards are just Null rather than to keep drawing until you hit an ingredient. Simple adjustment.The game itself is perfect for family night since it's easy to play and the gross ingredients appeal to a kid's sense of humor. But my friends and I are all mid-30s and we still had a blast! After the third time getting ""Health Inspector,"" one friend started cursing. Our other friend, who is a notorious trash-talker when she plays spades, called me a ""heifer"" when I smacked her, once again, with Tummy Ache. Did I mention this was a faith-based group for graduate students? LOLI've already bought the expansion pack and we're looking forward to playing again at our next monthly potluck. I might filter out a few of the action cards to help balance the deck with the Food Fight issue, but that's my only potential ""negative"" from the entire game.

Poorly written rules
","

  First of all, the game is cute. Good ideas from a creative kid, I'm happy to say that. However, it's not the kid's job to make sure that this game works as a game. This game's rules are so poorly written that we have to create our own rules just to play it. A good rulebook would address all possibilities and this one barely addresses any.First of all, the Food Fight card is incredibly confusing. Players compete in a fast-paced showdown and draw cards until they draw points cards, then compete to see who gets the highest point value card. But it's the details that matter. What happens when you draw an action card? According to the game rules, you can choose to play the action card immediately. But what about the point values? Do we keep drawing? Do we stop after drawing an action card? What happens if the action card is dependent on other things? What happens if we never draw a point value card? One time I got 12 action cards in a row and that literally wiped the whole deck. Is a Food Fight card supposed to basically end the game?And there's the fact that the entire purpose of the game, Taco vs Burrito, is completely pointless. There is no game mechanic that actually cares about whether you choose Taco or Burrito. It's aesthetic only. Why is the name of the game literally an aesthetic feature?To make it worse, there are even contradicting rules. The quick rules cards say that you can only put cards into your own burrito. But the full rulebook says you can put cards into OTHER peoples' burritos as well. Which one is it???? Makes a pretty big difference.This game is good if you're playing with children who don't understand board games much, and just want some dumb silly gross food fun. But if you're literally ANYBODY except a child, avoid this game until they clean up their rulebook.

As much fun for adults as kids!
","

  My granddaughters aged 5 and 8 love this game! The best thing about it is the adults have as much fun as the kids. The ""No Bueno"" cards are similar to the ""Nope"" cards in Exploding Kittens but the other action cards are original and perhaps even more fun. It is super-quick to learn and kids don't really have to read to play; it only takes them one round to know what all the cards do. My 5 year old beat the pants off us and we were hysterical with all the twists and turns. My only complaint is that I wish more could play, especially as $19.95 is a lot for a card game. When you have a game all ages can play, you need 6-8 people to be able to join in. We'll simply buy a second. Hopefully it goes on lightening deal again soon.

Fun but the game is not fully fleshed out
","

  The game is fun, my complaint (sort of) is their are basically no rules.  Basic gameplay instructions but no fleshed out details.  My family and I had to make up our own ""house rules"" for almost everything.  Actually, that was in some ways fun and creative for us to do, but what will happen if we ever play with anyone else who has the game?  We will have to negotiate and argue over each others rules (not fun).  I'll give an example: A player plays a minus card and the other plays a no bueno card.  What happens?  The game does not inform you.  Is it just a block and we can both keep our cards? we decided no.  Does it mean the player who blocks loses their no bueno card? Does the player who tried to play the minus just return it to their hand? do they still get to play something else? Or, does the attempted play count as their turn? Still what about the minus card? Is it considered played and discarded in the discard pile? Same question for the no bueno block card.  We decided that both cards are considered played and placed in the discard pile and the attempted play of the minus card counts as the players turn.  My point in writing this, is you will have to decided about things like this for quiet a bit until you figure out for yourselves all the different scenarios and card plays.  Really, all these things should be written out in a real rule book.I'll add one last thing, we find the game is fun played in a pre-determined number of rounds with the dealing passing around from player to player to keep it balanced.  You add up the scores of each round to determine a winner.  Adds a nice additional strategy level to each round game play.Still fun game.  Interesting strategy game.

  This game is exactly as much fun as you would expect a game designed by a seven year old to be.  It has some novelty value, as the cards have silly names, but even for other seven year olds it’s not very fun.  There are very few tactics, the lead shifts around according to chance, and a lot of the moves are zero-sum.  I can’t believe I paid $20 for this; we played it once and doubt we will bother again.

  I played this with my children, ages 8-12.

Too much confusion on what to do with cards in hand when game ends.No clear directions how to “tally” cards at end of game. Example, if you take “+cards” and the subtract “-card” then multiply “X2” card you will get different result then if you take “+card” then x2 then -cards. In one game it make a difference of one winner or two people tie.No instruction on game ending in tie.My kids didn’t really want to play again.

I don’t feel it was worth $20. I’d say more $10. But still a clever game. It would make a great gift.

  In this house we have a 10 year old, 26 year old, and two 50 year old members.  We all enjoy this game.  It reminds me a little of UNO, but the object before you go out of cards is to fill your taco/burrito with point cards.  We had to watch a youtube video on how to play, because the written instructions were slightly confusing on how the game ended.  The first time we played we turned over the discard pile and kept going, but as far as we can tell that is incorrect.  Once the draw pile is gone, the play continues until someone is out of cards from their hand.  Most points collected wins.  Lots of fun with cards that let you rob from other players, the discard pile, and change hands at the last minute with someone who was winning.  Hope this helps.

  It’s relatively simple but there are some important things left out in the instructions that left us unsure what to do. There really is no taco vs burrito since you can all be tacos really. I think I would like it more if the ingredients that got you points were actually ingredients you would want on a taco, and the deduction cards are gross things. But, that being said it’s impressive that a 7 year old came up with this game. We will play it again but I really need to research a few questions on what if’s in game play so I know what to do.

  This game was OK. I was excited about it based off of the reviews, but I have to say that we were all a little disappointed overall.It is a quick game, so I'm thankful for that as our kids could sit for hours playing games.However, I feel like there are certain aspects about the rules they didn't think about when making the game. Some of it just simply didn't make sense.

  The directions aren’t very clear- especially in regards to how many cards players have, and what happens when they start over on their hand (health inspector card drawn). It isn’t a bad game, but we felt like we fumbled through it and made rules as we went to make up for the lack of guidance with the included instructions. It isn’t worth $19.99. It should be maybe a $9 card game.

  It is a fun game and we play it almost every day. My son likes it most! Some rules need to be better explained (Food fight when drawing all action cards; can you use No bueno card if someone uses Envy card on you; etc). That said, we think that an expansion pack is very much needed, but the one with more food cards, and maybe some new action cards. We saw the video on Youtube introducing the Foody Edition pack for this game, but we could not get it either on Amazon or Taco vs Burritos web site.

Absolute blast for the adults and kids, READ WHY!
","

  So as a last minute thought, my daughter was turning 6, and i was searching around for a game that we could play together as a family, that would be fun also for the adults.This is it, at first, i saw the reviews and the awards and thought this surely sounds like it has great potential, and then while we were waiting for it to arrive via prime, i started doing some more reading about the game and read some other review from someone else, that was not on amazon, and I started to think this was basically going to be just like scrabble, simply matching either the colors of pictures of the tiles, until someone ran out of tiles to win.  This to me did not seem fun and I was almost certain I was going to end up returning it.  But i couldn't help remember that the game had won awards and all the great reviews from others, so who knows, maybe its great, maybe not.So showed up, daughter, I and Grandma sat down, at just the first couple of rounds it all came together and I could instantly see all of the strategy options, the fun of getting and using half and sun stones, along with wind tiles.  Not the depth of playing something like risk or civilization necessarily, but plenty of options and such to make it fun, and that it doesn't have to be a long sitting to play, that is nice with our busy life style.But WAIT, the BEST part of this game, AT LEAST FOR US, was i wanted something we ALL could play and have fun, and even though it will take multiple game plays for the young one to learn all of the strategy tactics, she still had fun because it was easy to match the pictures and colors, and when you matched two or more sides, getting half or sun stones, her eyes glowed like fire!So even though we can play competitively, and she just plays for the matching and fun, FOR NOW, everyone enjoys, This might be one of the best thought out family games I have ever seen.Most kid games are cute, and they like them, but not all that fun for the adult, other than watching the children enjoy themselves, we can actually have fun at the same time!BRILLIANT.

Great Game for the WHOLE Family

  We just started playing Latice Hawai'i, and I see this game going into PERMANENT rotation on game nights and for Family gatherings. I had been eyeing it for a while, and we finally picked it up, and I'm so glad I did. It's thinky enough to be interesting, but you can also play on a lighter level while chatting.Why we like it-It's fairly easy to learn with straightforward rules.It plays in about 20- 35 minutes (depending on analysis paralysis). There's even an included timer, if you do have someone holding up the game!The pieces are solid, and can take a lot of handling without breaking down (the tiles and holders are plastic) and the game insert holds them perfectly, whether you shelve games horizontally or vertically. (I love the gems!)The artwork is good... clean and clear images and great colors.There are multiple layers of rules, so you can adjust for the younger players.The Rule book is clear, but you can also see videos put out by the company.It works for all the different generations of players in the family (my mom down to my kids) I can not emphasize how important this is in my world. Our family plays games when we get together, so we are always looking for something that works for multiple generations... and is still fun for everyone.The Latice Hawaii box is fairly compact, so we can take it along on vacations.It's tile laying, and that's our family sweet spot!Latice Hawaii is well deserving of all of the awards that it's won. I recommend it without reservation!

  Our family (kids ages 12-18) love games that are reasonably quick to learn, don't take too long to play, and require some smarts and strategy. This one fits the bill perfectly! The game and parts are all beautiful and very well made. I love the design of the box as well!  It looks like it will hold up better than some traditional boxes. We have only played a few times so far, but each time, everyone starts to pick up a few more strategic moves and figures out how to better play the game. My teens usually groan and roll their eyes at family game time (even though they usually have fun anyway), but so far, I haven't gotten any rolled eyes from this one! Score!

Great strategy game for kids and adults! So many ways to play also!
","

  We (adult couple, late twenties) enjoy strategy games and this one was extremely easy to learn. The company even has a wonderful 3 minute video on YouTube to explain how to play so you don’t have to read the directions!This game can have as much strategy as you desire. A younger child could easily pick it up because you match the colors/shapes basically; however, you have wind pieces that move other pieces to set up for you next move. You want to get rid of all your tiles first. So, kids may take longer to master the strategy part of it but could still play and enjoy with adults. That’s awesome!This game is made of TOP QUALITY materials. The board is very thick and nicely printed. The plastic tile tray is thick and very nice with the name of the board game on the back and it holds 5 tiles perfectly. The tiles are thick plastic with stickers already on them so it’s ready to play out of the box. The gemstones are plastic and feel great in your hand. It also comes with a timer for other ways to play the game—which is also neat! The rules include several other ways to play the game so you can swap it out and it becomes a whole new experience if you want something different or more challenging.If you like board games or are looking to get into playing board games, this is a great intro game to get you started because it’s so easy to learn. I recommend showing the short video before having new people play with you so they have the gist.Buy this game!!! It’s well worth the money in quality product, fun game time (20 minutes each game), and ability to mix it up and play different versions WITHOUT any type of expansion packs.

  We are a board game family, so finding a new, fun game isn't that easy.  I like games with easy to figure out directions and this one fits that bill.  I also like games that don't take a super long time to set up or play.  I often play with one child at a time, and after playing several games in a row, I don't want to feel like my day is shot.  This is perfect for that.  It's fun, easy for everyone to understand, and it's got just the right combination of strategy and luck involved.  I actually was surprised at how much fun we all have had playing and I'm thrilled to add another great game to our collection.  The pieces and board are nice quality, too.

  Ordered this in early March off a sponsored ad on Facebook and saved it for my son’s birthday gift at the end of the month. Currently staying home due to Covid 19 regulations and have to say, of all the myriad games and crafts we have in the house, THIS is the one game everyone wants to play every day, multiple times a day. In full disclosure, our family has an affinity for anything Polynesian or Polynesian-inspired, and the artwork and Hawaiian motifs are awesome! But, you don’t have to be a Hawaii lover to love this game. The playing pieces are universally attractive. The game pieces are great quality- sturdy cardboard game board with beautiful full color scenery on one side and the game grid on the other. Playing pieces are durable plastic with pretty graphic motifs. The game play is simple enough that my advanced 7 year old and 10 year old understood it in one game, yet challenging enough to keep both adults happy and entertained. It’s a little bit like dominoes but more complex and a lot more fun! Unlike a game like Monopoly that can draw on and on and get stale, or a game like Scrabble that can sometimes feel too much like more schooling after hours spent doing online virtual lessons, this game feels fresh, enjoyable, stress-relieving and a little bit like a vacation from all the craziness going on in the world today. I’m so happy I bought this and highly recommend it for anyone looking for a timeless game that’s a little outside of the box.

  Too many rules to learn. This game is lovely. The game pieces are beautiful and it is well made. Problem is, it is not easy for someone to just jump in and start playing with you. You really have to study and learn all the little ins and outs of the game. This makes it difficult to find others to play. It’s sort of like someone who doesn’t know how to play chess trying to jump in and play. It’s not going to go so well. So if a group of you want to learn together- great. But I feel I wasted my money. This game is going to sit around and take up space.

Quick to learn and play, yet requires strategy.
","

  If you are looking for a simple, light strategy game to play against one to three other players I would recommend this game.  In Latice Hawai'i tiles are laid out onto a Scrabble style board with the object of the game being to get rid of all your tiles. Tiles are placed side to side next to other tiles in such a way they match color for color, image for image or combo by matching pictures to one and colors to others; think Dominoes with pictures and color.  While it seems simple enough with concept of one turn one play, the board and placement of tiles allow you to earn gems that can be used for extra moves on a turn, potentially allowing you to use all 5 tiles on a turn. Wind tiles also allow for players to move pieces in a one move slide giving for even bigger gem earning combos.Pros:All pieces are strong and durable as they are made with plastic.Tiles are big and easily readable with colors not being so close can't tell what color is what.Game has a free app for phones to play against another person (No 3 or 4 person game)Easy to follow instructions.The box is amazing! I have many games and sadly some companies forget to put effort into the small things like the box as they do the game (sometimes the games also).  As can see in the photo posted Latice made sure to create a tray to fit fit all the pieces in the box nice and neat without worry about box bulging.Cons:While tiles are made from a hard plastic the images are stickers, so after much use they could fade. Would take some time but enjoy how BGG (I think) does their dice stile tiles with image inside the material. (Maybe one day they will do this for Latice like they do other games).  Overall I don't see this being a huge issue as can pick up and play from the sides and the stickers are surrounded by a lip thus protecting them more from peel out. Not star dropping worthy, as still getting good setup and those pieces can cost quite a bit (As much if not more than games themselves).Colors could still be an issue if color blind so might have issues if you are. (Orange, dark blue, purple, green, yellow). Again doesn't effect most but could be an issue. Not star dropping worthy.The board game is standard cardboard but nicely made.  This isn't something star taking worthy but would love to see a game made that will create a small lip on the board to hold pieces in place better when played.  While might add little time moving pieces that are ""Wind""ed would be helpful.OVERALL:While there are a couple little things that feel could be nicer, with what the game offers and how most others are, I feel it is worth the amount spent on it. So if wanting  to play a strategy versus game while still being able to have a conversation this is worth a spot on the shelf and more importantly the table.

Family fun game that plays quickly
","

  Family game night is one of our favorite things to do. We enjoy putting away the electronics and sit down at the table and dive into something that our family of all ages can play together.  With the different ages of our kids the games need to be quick and easy to understand.  This game hits both points.While it did take a couple times to actually understand the different ways to score points once we learned what we were doing wrong the game quickly became very a family favorite.  The game came packaged and all the pieces were durabale and organized. The card holders had deep set places so when packing up the game there were not lost pieces.  The tiles are sturdy and strong. Our toddler actually tried to snack on them and they held up to her slobber.I do encourage you to watch the videos about how to play the game and score gems but the game is fun. It is something that our 6 year old can play with us. It also is a quick game. Nothing long like Monopoly or Life where you just keep going and going. This game plays quickly and depending on how quickly tiles are being played can be played in under 40 minutes!Go ahead and hang ten. Grab this game and relax with the water themed board. A fun family game that makes you think ahead and plan your next move. You need to add this game to your collection today.

  I previously owned the first edition of this game. For some reason they re-branded this game to Latice Hawaii instead of just leaving it called Latice. They should have kept the original name and it could have just been a 2nd edition. The name is actually quite bad now, but that doesn't really impact the game play. Compared to the original latice, the tiles are better, the coloring/art of the tiles is better, the board is far superior, the tile holders are nicer, and the game comes with a nice insert. On the other hand there are a few minor down grades over the previous version. The box itself is kind of bad. The quality isn't as nice, its a standard box but compared to the premium feel/thickness of the first edition, its a down grade. We also personally hate the box art on the new one, I wish they'd kept the previous box and art. Trying to figure out if i should put the new stuff in the old box. Then the half stones (blue ones, previously called moon stones at one point in time), they should be HALF the size of the sun stones, not the same size. The previous version had them as half the size, idk why they changed this.As to the game play, its a fun little game. Likely great for kids/family. Its simple to pickup and while the game play isn't complex it has enough choice to keep you interested when you just want a light abstract game to play. My wife and I really enjoy Latice and it'll likely stay in our collection for a long time.

Fun, quick family game
","

  This is a light, fun game that is easy to teach.  My 8 year old grasped the concepts in a few minutes and we were able to start our first game right away.  The game does have some strategy, but it is not too deep.  I was surprised that, though I had a leg up on my son due to years of gaming experience, I didn't have too high a leg up on my son.  He was able to make great strategic moves on his own.  I was ""taking it easy"" on him for our first game, and he ended up beating me because I waited too long to ""catch up.""  The game is also fairly quick; we have played a few games, and each one was less than half an hour.I must say that, for the price, the game quality is fantastic:* The board is thick enough cardboard that I am not concerned over its longevity.  I also like that the company put their game artwork on the backside of the board, instead of just having a solid black surface.* The tile trays are a nice, translucent blue acrylic that is very pleasant to the eye and matches the theme.* The included gems, yellow ""sunstones"" and blue ""half stones"", are a fun experience.  Having physical representations, instead of cardboard tokens, is a nice tactile element added to the game.* The tiles are a little thin, with stickers on each one, but I am surprisingly OK with them.  The sticker area is recessed, so I don't have any concern about them coming off after repeated handling.  And, honestly, I don't think making them heavier duty would accomplish much.Overall, this is a really fun game and I am glad I picked it up for our family.

  The game is beautiful. The tiles, board, instructions, etc. are well done and colorful. The game, however, just isn't all that fun: the wind tiles are overpowered and there's no way to prevent your opponent from doing anything.

  I bought this game because of it's rewards, and it looked like something my daughter could learn to play.  With the pandemic it's been a struggle to keep our children active, but away from the screen.  I've been desperately looking for ways to spend time with her that will also have the added benefit of keeping me entertained as well.This game has been awesome.  It took a few times and some patience, but 4 year old daughter has picked-up how to play this game.  We started out by removing the wind tiles from play and then eventually added them back in once she got the hang of how to play.The game initially plays really easily.  You just match ties like dominos and or scrabble, but then the addition of the stones and windtiles adds stackable complexity to the strategy of how the game can be really played out.The build quality is excellent!  The tiles are really well-made hard plastic while the boards and stands are also very rigid and well made.  No cardboard that will bend and distort here.Overall happy with the purchase.  Still haven't officially beaten my daughter yet ( my streak is 0-8), but looking forward to playing more games in the future with her.

  First off, I did receive a coupon against part of the price of the game. I have eyed this game since December. We did not buy it last year as our son is still pretty young. But, I wish we would have!To begin with, they did an amazing job on the packaging. It’s not a cheap game by any means. It’s a quality product!!The instructions and super clear and precise. They troubleshoot with you about possible problems. And they also offer tips. The setup is easy!!In case math is not a strong point, the instructions break down how many pieces are dealt to each player.We’ve played as a family, which has been great. I cannot wait until the end of social distancing and we can play against adult friends too. The game is challenging for adults, with the extra options available through the tips. But, the basic game can be played by kids.I’d recommend this game for sure!  It’s high quality!  Super details. And the concept is new and refreshing.

  This is a fun, kid-friendly mix of Qwirkle and Scrabble. I’m not the best at figuring out how to play a new game, but I was able to and taught it to my kids fairly quickly. They are 5 and 8. The 5 year old definitely isn’t going to win anytime soon, but he enjoyed playing and understood the concept of matching pictures or colors to get sun and moon stones. The sun and moon stones are awesome. They are multi-faceted plastic “jewels” that is the highlight of the game for any kid. The tiles are really high quality, too. They didn’t skimp on pieces by any means. As long as you keep the pieces together, these things are indestructible and beautiful.I don’t really get the Hawaii theme, but it’s unique. One thing that would make it better would be some sort of story behind it that gives you more purpose and ties in the theme.We’ve actually only tried the young kids’ version, and I am excited to add in the cloud tiles that let you shift pieces to score more points. I can definitely see how that would make the game infinitely more interesting to adults. Haven’t you always wished you could move scrabble pieces around?

  Let's start with product quality. The box itself is very nice with magnetic flap cover. Box art is pretty cool. Inside there's a plastic tray to allow all the game pieces to be nearly organized. All the pieces are plastic which is fine to me. The tiles are very nice, not some flimsy paper or cardboard. The little stone pieces look pretty cool; my 4 year old really likes holding and looking at them. The game board is cardboard, with nice printed graphics. IMO, product quality is very good.I played this game with my 4 year old. The rules are simple, so it was easy for me to explain the rules to him. He was able to understand the concept within a few minutes of playing. I think this allowed him to come up with strategies instead of trying to remember the rules. The tile colors and shapes are easily distinguishable. To me it's similar to Dominos or Othello in that the concept is simple and straightforward, but there's room to incorporate strategy.Overall, I think it's a great game.

  This game captured our attention because of the claim to be color-blind friendly since both our young boys are. This game was a hit with the 4 year old and all the way to the adults. It took a second to grasp the concept but after that, everyone was fully engaged. The gems were extra exciting to the boys as well. The game’s packaged nicely which helps with maintaining pieces.  It was throughly enjoyed by all ages and color did not impact anyone from playing. This will be a fun strategy game to pull out on rainy days for our kids for a long time!

  We are new to strategy games and love this one. After playing 3 times, our 7-year old has the concepts down well, but sometimes needs a little help seeing what good plays are available. At the same time, sometimes he sees things we missed. I have not won a single round yet - but he has!

  Edit: After my initial review, Customer Service finaly got in touch with me and did a good job of hearing my concerns and doing what they could to make things right. I have improved my rating to reflect not only my happiness with their service but also to reflect my honest impressions with what i consider to be a wonderful board game.Original review:I have experience playing older versions of this game. I was excited to see their newest version, Hawaii. The quality of mine was lacking however. Many of the stickers were placed crooked on the tile pieces. My box had a cut along its front surface presumably cause when someone opened a case of games and dug their razor in a little too deep. I contacted the company via their link, but got no response. Mechanically, this is a wonderful game. I was just a little disappointed with the quality control of this particular version.

Fun and easy to learn
","

  The first thing you notice the moment you open the box is this is a very pretty game. It has the blue ocean feel of Hawaii. Then the tiles for the game are both sturdy and well made (so that they will last) and have nice Hawaiian style pictures on them also. It even has the added touch of the rounded blue tile holder to use instead of just laying your tiles face down on the board. The gameplay itself is simple; you match your tiles to surrounding tiles similar to an Uno game (you match the color or the picture). There is an extra bit of strategy in how you use the Wind Tiles to move the tiles on the board to allow you to place some of the ones in your hand. Also, you learn how to save and use the colored stones to your advantage to get more Wind Tiles or extra turns. All and all, this is eye-catch, easy to learn, and fun. I recommend it.

Our grandson's favorite holiday game
","

  As suggested in other reviews, we watched videos as well as reading to help us learn the rules. They are a bit complicated at first, but we all caught on quickly. Our 7-year-old grandson figured out a move we hadn't imagined but seems to fit those rules, and that made playing even more fun. There's both luck and strategy involved. He wins an overwhelming majority of the time. It was a hit with both him and the adults, so we played again and again during the holidays.

","

  I have been waiting for my son to be old enough to get this game. He's 7, so I thought I tried this game with him and he was able to follow the rules and play it right away. What I like the most about the game is the strategic thinking involved, with possibility to match not only by color, but also by shape. And add a little math and micro economic to it by earning half stone, sun stone and trading them. Last is the wind tile. I love this because it makes my son to think how to create an opportunity for him to match more tiles and get more sun stones.Note: I received this product with discounted price promotion but the feedback is based on my own experience playing this game with my son.

Really Fun Game
","

  My husband and I have been enjoying playing together. We played for the first time yesterday, and we played at least 4 or 5 rounds...so a LOT. I really hate games that are all chance so and am always on the lookout for logic/strategy games. This one fit the bill. There is a bit of chance, but this game is majority strategy if you equally divide up the wind tiles. I personally enjoy brain games more, and it's even better when I can use them when tutoring students, as well. I like that there's a kiddy version where you can use the same materials but simplify the rules for the younger crowd. The more we played yesterday, the more strategy we used as we became more comfortable with the rules. We'll definitely be playing again soon. It was a a lot of fun. I did receive a discount as a part of a promotion, but this opinion is honest. I honestly don't know if I would have bought it otherwise because I already have so many games, but I'm really glad I did because it's a great addition to my collection.

  I saw this game advertised on Facebook. They offered a rebate, but thankfully there was no request for a feedback like some other products I’ve seen. I’m leaving this review purely because it’s deserved.This board game has a level of quality I haven’t seen in a LONG time. The board itself is thick and sturdy. The pieces are smooth—you don’t have to twist them out of a plastic grid like so many other board games which then leaves that nub at the edge of the pieces. They also have a nice weight to them. The graphics are pleasing and the colors are beautiful. The racks are sturdy and a beautiful clear blue color, and the gems are pretty and fun to play with. The design and quality alone make this game a pleasure to play.The game itself is easy to learn, and there is a video explaining the rules very clearly. Once my family started to play, we quickly found that it definitely required strategic thinking which was fun.

  We have been playing this while stuck at home because of COVID 19. My kids love it, but there is also strategy so it’s fun for the entire family to play. My 7 year old is seriously competitive!

  This is one of the best designed board games we have. The pieces and board look great, everything is very sturdy. Even down to the design of the box, this thing looks great. The rule book takes 10 minutes max to read through the entire thing, and you’re ready to play. My wife and I have played probably a dozen games of it, replay-ability is really great too. Easy enough for kids to play, yet plenty of strategy for adults. The only downside I can find is that setup does take a little bit of time since there are 84 pieces that have to be mixed up, but that just comes with the nature of the game. This game should be a staple in every board game collection!

  This is a really fun game. Addicting. My wife and I will play several rounds back-to-back. We feel it’s a perfect combination of strategy and luck.Note 1: we always play the ‘balanced’ way where we distribute the wind tiles equally among players. Otherwise it gets really unfair.Note 2: the one thing we feel this game could use is some bags for the tiles. Each player should have their own bag to hold their tiles in. We use our own makeshift ones, but it would be nice if cloth bags were included with the game.Without bags, it’s too hard for players to shuffle their tiles.

  This game is fun! We have only played the original play style (there are options for more difficult games). Took about 10 minutes to learn but one figured out it is simple. Looking forward to playing more ways. The board is pretty. I don't think it will be challenging enough to play super often though. But good for kids. Only complaint I have is the purple and magenta tiles are a little too similar in color, it has confused us a couple times. The magenta should be either pinker or a different color altogether. **I received a discount to try the game and leave a review**

Of course your moves are totally dependent players before you, but it is a great game for kids and adults to play.  I highly recommend this for families and adults. We have an 8 and 11 year old and everyone has won.  It is a thinking game that forces you to see patterns, and think strategically about where to place your tiles for maximum benefit.  Definitely worth getting - even without the Facebook offer.

We needed to find one that would hold the teens interest as well. Enter Latice Hawaii.  It was easy to learn and everyone enjoyed it. There are videos on YouTube that help.

We were able to learn the rules via the video in 10-15mins and over the first round itself, we were comfortable playing at easy level and we all were able to figure out the strategy over time. Our 6yr old daughter was thinking 2-3 steps ahead already which was great. She also loved the fact that there are fun crystals in the game and beautiful looking cards.

  We have played this game 5 or so times since it arrived last week. It is a fast paced game where you are trying to match colors and shapes to score points and get rid of your tiles first.It reminds me a little of qwirkle but different in terms of building lines for rewards. In this game, you are rewarded for being surrounded by similar shapes and colors on all sides of the tiles you play versus making lines that contain all six colors or shapes.There is also the rewards- sun and water tokens for bonuses that let you play additional tiles to get rid of your tiles faster.

Well made, light but fun game
","

  I bought Lattice Hawaii during a promotion, even though I hadn't heard of it before. I've been running a board game club with students at my school this year, and thought something light would be welcome. I was pleasantly surprised how fun the game was. It's very light, can be taught in just a couple of minutes. But there are some strategic decisions to be made with a satisfying end. Even though players draw tiles every turn at random, luck isn't a big factor.Player interaction is good, not aggressive but it's definitely possible to ruin someone else's opportunities while pursuing your own.Players who like Azul or Carcassone will probably like Lattice Hawaii. It is lighter than either of those, but has what makes them both fun for me.

It feels like a mashup between Scrabble and Quirkle with an added level of strategy buy providing ways to gain extra turns. There is the mid game you need to think about but also the end game when the board is nearly full and you need to be able to drop that last tile or have the least tiles in hand.All in all we are glad we made this purchase, and very much enjoy the game. Thank you!

  Really like the game but it came short one blue tile holder.  While there's a space for it there was no holder. It appeared sealed so think it's an error on company's  part, but no where to report it to and get other one. Consequently our 4th player had to find a box to rest hus tiles on so others can't see them. That was a not ok for a game of thus cost and for its reviews.

  After watching some reviews and gameplay videos I decided to get this game and give it a try despite the biggest criticism being that the game doesn’t rely on strategy all that much but in luck, after several rounds and several hours invested I can conclude it is not the case, it feels like that at the beginning but it is definitely a strategy game and your learn that for yourself, there are different stages throughout a match in which you rely both on luck and strategy but towards the end when the available moves become scarce full strategy kicks in. It is a fun game, well built, cleverly designed and with a lot of replay value. My only gripe is that the sand-clock gets stuck every now and then, though we don’t really use it all that much.

  One of the best games ever! Don’t let the amount of pieces in the box scare you. If you’re not good with following directions on paper, watch some YouTube videos on how to play. Once you get the concept, you’ll want to keep playing again and again. The expansions are so much fun once you play a few rounds of the standard game. I strongly suggest playing a few rounds without the expansion so you can grasp the concept of the game before adding in new rules. It will be much less complicated that way. This game is great regardless if it’s 2 players or 5...the more players, the longer the game play. Everyone in our group has different strategies and everyone has won at least once...so what works for one, may not work for another or what worked for someone during one game, may not work in another game. This is one of our top games, though, and we’ve played a LOT during our game nights with friends.

  I played this game without expansions at a friend's house for the first time.  I had previewed it online and discounted it as too simple and boring.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The game is high in strategy, easy to learn or teach, and high replayability.  The expansions aren't necessary but are well worth the price for the big box.  With a random layout and using  zero, one, or both expansions, it's never the same game twice.  It plays extremely well with all player counts.All of the components are very good quality with one exception.  The cardboard money doesn't seem to hold up really well.  I recommend just getting metal coins.  This is such a minor flaw that it still gets 5 stars in my book.In short this has become one of my favorite games, and gets to the table more often than just about any other game I own.

Not high quality, but it serves it's purpose. I would spend a few more bucks and buy a better set.
","

  So I will be returning this for sure. It is definitely not ""Hight Quality"".First of all, the board is crooked. You can actually see that in the picture if you look closely. Maybe that's a minor thing to some people, but to me it feels like the company just didn't care enough. It also makes the set look way cheaper.Second, the pieces are very light, they almost feel plastic.Third, the velvet covers on a couple of the pieces are slightly chipped. That made the set seem used or once again the company just didn't give a damn enough to avoid such a minor defect.I am only giving this product 3 stars because it is affordable and fully functional. It doesn't wobble and nothing is broken. The wood which the box is made out of, also seems to be pretty good quality. So if you are looking for a temporary set, or something to teach your kids how to play, or a an extra set to keep around, then this will work just fine. But I got this as a present for my boyfriend and he was disappointed, as was I.

  No, this is not a stunning chess set, but yes, it's a really decent set to learn on and a very good value for the money. I saw the $6 set and just knew it couldn't be worth even just the $6. But for $20, I'm very happy with this set. A couple of the pawns are not quite straight, but not terribly so. I would recommend. I'm using an app on my phone to learn how to plat better and if I end up really like it, I'll likely look for a really nice set at some point.

Disappointing first game...
","

  I would give it a 5, but it was not ""High Quality"" as it promised. First the bag's string was already coming apart when I opened it up for the first time. Some of the pieces' felt has little glue on the outside of the felt, causing scratches on the board. The felts are also not centered, causing scratches. The rooks crowns are not finished, with the wood chipping off. One of the Black rooks are also chipped towards the bottom. The chess board and is crooked and that is disappointing. All of this was noticed in rhe first game. If 203 brands can fix all these problems and talk with us for a refund or replacement, we will give you guys a different rating.

Just right

  My 11 year old just learned to play chess and wanted to get his own board.  He looked for several, but they all seemed to be 9"" x 9"".  I told him he had to get one at least 12""x12"" that was reasonable.  This fit the bill perfectly.  It's the right size and the quality was better than expected.  It's just right for my son as a beginner and anyone else who's into chess but doesn't want to spend a ridiculous amount of money at this time.  I like that it becomes the carrying case for the pieces.

  I like the look of this chess set.  Very simple, clean lines, and squared edges.  The inside felt is clean and looks well put together as well.  That said, the board wood feels very cheap, almost like balsa wood.  Since I just received it yesterday, I can't speak to its durability, but time will tell.

  Update: The day my initial review posted, MetaRetail contacted me to send me replacement pieces. The pieces arrived the next day and match the rest of the set. I have upgraded to 4/5 stars.***I was excited as I began to set this up, but then found that a white knight piece was damaged and one brown pawn was missing. I contacted MetaRetail who referred me to Amazon Returns. However, since I don't have the shipping carton (and other obstacles in exchanging this item) I'm just going to have my brother whittle me a pawn.

  Got this as a starter chess set for my 8 year old. The pieces are nice and sturdy with padding on the bottom. It comes with 2 bags for putting pieces in and the board folds up so you can store pieces inside.  The board is sturdy enough for a beginner but I could see that it could get easily scuffed up or break when my hooligans use it improperly (think leaving it out on the floor and stepping on it... ugh) We bought a ""how-to"" book, but it came with pretty decent directions in it already.

  For first game with an 8 and 11 year old, I took out only the 22 North America cards.  We played with 7 cards each.Before starting, I did a quick overview - how many continents are there?  Can you name them (Oceania was less well known than Australia as continent name) ?  How many countries (wow - LOTS)?  Then looked at the 4 facts on each card, pointing out what M (million) and K (thousand) meant.  Looked over the map.  They were ready for the entire set by the end of the first small game.  We briefly looked at a map of the world that showed the names of all the countries.  Biggest take away for 8 year old - how really tiny countries can have enormous populations.  If I move to using the challenge facts, I'll start small again - beginning with North America.Their mother told me that night they couldn't stop talking about the game.

Good, fun learning tool -- just add your own tweaks!

  Our family recently purchased The World Game. This review reflects us (three adults) having played it several times.We'd say it's fun in a learning-is-fun kind of way. The cards are well made, and included with the set is a map of the world of good, sturdy paper.One of the nice things about the game is that you can modify play in a variety of ways. The rules as provided, while fine, need not limit how you want to approach learning about other countries. For instance, we initially began playing with a mix of cards representing countries from all over the globe...pretty challenging unless you're already good at geography, which we are not (yet)!So instead, we'll work on countries one continent at a time.But that's just one example of how you can do your own thing.Also, we've noticed that the game's creator listens to suggestions from players. He fulfilled the wish of one online commenter by sending a pdf of countries in alphabetical order with their corresponding numerical designation on the game's map. We got that list when we purchased the game. And actually, we made our own list too, arranging the countries in numerical order so we can immediately find the name of any country on the map. Another addition we intend to make on our spreadsheet is primary languages spoken (data we will obtain through our own research).So, obviously, there are lots of ways you can expand on The World Game if you like. It is a cool little learning tool.

  I’m a huge geography nerd and wanted to try this game out to see if it could challenge me, and I absolutely loved it! It’s a great study and learning tool if you really want to refine your geography skill. The game itself is quite fun and I loved that you could play with pretty much anyone regardless of how good they were at geography with the use of game styles that can be altered per person, for example my gf is not good at geography so I would only ask her what continent the country was at, inversely I’m good at countries but am not so good at capital cities. Like this we had a very fair game where I was beat. Liked it a lot and would recommend it especially as a learning tool for geography teachers and professors. I would also say that they should have an expansion pack for physical geography and such, which would make the game even more challenging!

  I bought this game to supplement my middle schooler's understanding of geography and the larger world. She loves the Top Trumps card games so this was an easy sell even though it's ""educational"" and not just for fun. There are different ways to use the cards to help give your child a better sense of the world and geography. I've found the game to be a great jumping off point for conversations. She asks to play it so that's a good sign! I gave it four stars instead of five because it'd be nice if there was a bit more information about the nations on the cards. There were also a couple of errors with the numbering and the nation's they match up to on the world map.

The games offered vary from a sort of ""war card game"" where a player chooses a fact they think will trump other player's cards to idenitifying country by flag, continent, etc.We paid 25 bucks, which is a bit steep in my book, but everything seems to be getting more expensive these days.

Decent game for teaching basic geography to kids
","

  Simple game with cards representing all the world's countries. Definitely don't need to know tons about geography as you will learn as you go. But, the game is pretty simple and could be a lot more interesting if there were facts in addition to population, land mass, continent, highest elevation. It's fine for kids learning basic geography. Not sure it will hold most adults' attention for long.

  Not enough built in aspects to make this game truly a learning experience. You can easily play a whole game without ever looking at the map.  A master list of numbered countries would also be helpful. Unfortunately, I doubt we will ever play this expensive game again.

Perfect game for all ages

  This is one of the best educational board game!  I have bought it to my 11 years old son, to extend his geography knowledge and sense of the world. It really helps him to orientate on the map and have better understanding of countries location.It also gives knowledge about population of every country and flags. After playing a couple of times he can name the good number of countries by their flags.It is very good for adults too - you will refresh your internal geography  database and even learn something new.Pros:Very good polygraphic quality of every piece - cards, map, box.  The box is very solid - you won't break it even if you step on it. Every picture is very colorful and bright. Cards are thick and also look sturdy.The game itself is very interesting and enjoying. You gonna learn a lot playing any variant of the game.194 cards with flags, capitals, population, highest point and number of neighboring countries.Detailed, well marked colorful map for easier navigation.Cons:Nothing come up to my mind

  This game is Awesome!  Basic game is like the game 'war' played with real cards, but the information on the cards makes it a challenge and takes strategy to learn the countries in play and how they relate to each other.  My daughter (10th grade) and I are in a race to see who can memorize the capitals and flags faster (194 of each).  I think she would have enjoyed this at any age because there is enough chance in who gets what cards so no ones' feelings are hurt, but enough strategy that there are possibilities for increasing the odds of winning.

learn country names, location, flag
","

  This is not a game we bought for kids. My spouse and I bought it to complement our collection of other board and card games, for something different for us to do sometimes.  If you want an occasional 5 - 10 minute distraction and learn or be reminded of country names, location, and flag then this could be fun for you too.  When we see a country in the cards we hadn't thought of much before then sometimes we follow up and look up on wikipedia to see what other generally interesting things we could learn about the country.

Overpriced deck of playing cards
","

  It’s basically a small deck of cards with (4) facts like area, population, highest point and the total amount of neighboring countries.  It doesn’t even list the neighboring countries.  The cards do show a flag and the capital.  I wish I realized it was a deck of cards and not a “board game” as advertised in the title.  For the cost, I would have expected more of a Trivial Pursuit type board game and not a deck of playing cards for the most part.  It’s certainly not worth $30.  I honestly wouldn’t pay more than $10 for the cards.

I’ve played this game with my friends and every time I keep learning more and more about flags, capitals, and locations of all the countries all around the world. If you want to start to learning about the countries in the world, or just like geography in general, this is one of the few games that make geography really fun. I highly recommend it!

  A great game for geography enthusiasts, or to help kids develop and interest in geography. My son loves this game, but when his cousins play it with him we modify it slightly so that he doesn't just give them the flag challenge all of the time (because that would give him the advantage). It increased his cousin's interest in geography and they had a great time playing the game. When I play, I learn something each time. You really can't help but learn! I love this game and am glad we purchased it.

  This is a good game but it has a few major flaws. There are some countries that can never win the challenges because they are smaller, have small populations, and low elevation.

The best board game of all time
","

  This is the best board game I have ever played.  Okay, it helps that I love Dune (the book and the 1984 movie).  But the mechanics of the game is just genius.  They found a brilliant way to incorporate the sand worm, spice, weather storms, poison, poison snooper, lasgun (which, if played against a shield acts like an atomic explosion), family atomics, and characters/factions into how the game plays, which makes it an absolute thrill for those of us familiar with the story (especially if familiar with the book) but also quite fun for those who are not.  I highly recommend reading the book in and of itself, and you will see for yourself how it all ties in together.  If the book is too much, just watch the 1984 movie (not the horrible ""SyFy"" series re-make, which is an abomination with terrible acting).There is an incredible balance between the factions that shows it must have been painstakingly tested.  The Harkonnen initially seemed like they were way too powerful (they get 4x as many traitors and 2x as many treachery cards, making them a nasty faction to fight with) and the Emperor seemed too rich, but as I've tried out the other groups I have come to see how their unique abilities can be used to crush the Harkonnen and make life hell for the Emperor using the Fremen, Atreides, or guild.  Still not used to the Bene Geserit, but haven't played that faction myself yet.I actually play the game with my 10 year old, 8 year old, and 7 year old.  The 7 and 8 year old don't quite grasp the strategy, but follow the rules perfectly.  My wife is not much of a board gamer, but after the first game she came to like the game as well.  After the first game the whole thing flows fairly well.  There are excellent videos from the company detailing the rules in a simple and effective fashion.  But there is a very well written quick start manual in addition to the more detailed manual.  You can start playing pretty quickly - don't believe people who say its too complex.It may not be for people who are easily offended or bear a grudge.  When, as the Fremen you use the sandworm to wipe out someone's entire army, or as the Atriedes use your prescience to trick people into paying a lot of money for a worthless card, or as the Harkonnen destroy someone's entire army by simply controlling their general as a traitor, or as the rich Emperor you gloat over everyone who has to call ""CHOAM charity"" you will sometimes tick off your friends/family and they may seek revenge on you the next round.  I just sit back and watch my children fight each other and me and just laugh, grateful that at the end of the game I don't actually live in the treacherous and Machiavellian world of Frank Herbert's Dune.

  This game is a classic. This is the most recent rerelease of the game since it first came out around 1979. It is highly political, combative and focused around occupying territories. It include Factions in the game play so if you’re not used to that, you basically have multiple character groups to choose from to play during the game. Every faction has its strengths and weaknesses. Once the game picks up you have the option to form alliances with other players and their factions. This allows players to share their strengths with other players and hopefully helping you both win the game together.There are many twists and turns that the game takes and it is very strategy heavy. Best part is that everyone has a different strategy because everyone’s character is so different. And yes there is backstabbing that can happen in this game.  Learning the game took us a few game plays and we still haven’t narrowed down all of the specifics and have had to google a couple things to get more clarity on how to proceed in specific situations. Also - it’s a long game. We’ve only played a few times but one of our games did end up lasting for 5 hours. It’s such a great game for board game enthusiasts. I definitely recommend it!

A unique experience that you will want to play again and again
","

  The GameDune is unlike any other game I've ever played. Every player controls a unique factions with awesome, game-changing advantages and abilities that make each one unique to play and to play against. It is a game of secrets, surprises, alliances, betrayals, conquest and comebacks. Perhaps most intriguing of all, itIt seems daunting at first, there are a lot of rules to go over and almost all of them have an exception to remember. But while that can seem intimidating, the gameplay itself is actually quite easy to pick up, and all those exceptions are lore based and so are easy to remember when you get why they are there. Having started with a group of first timers that don't normally play overly complex board games, I can attest to the fact that it is actually quite accessible. Just take the time to go over the rules, maybe have a quick practice game for a turn or two, and everyone should be able to get it.The rules are broken up into basic and advanced rulesets. I personally recommend skipping to the advanced rules right away since they are where the best parts of the game are and you don't want to have to unlearn bad habits from the basic rules. That said, I think the general consensus is to ignore the ""Advanced Combat"" rules which just add a distinctly unfun spice tax to battles. The Advanced Combat rules are meant to be paired with the Increased Spice Flow rules, which add more money to the economy, and many groups keep those even after ignoring the spice tax because it adds a little more money and more opportunities for alliances, but it works either way.This VersionThis game is a re-release of a classic board game that, as I understand it, had been held up by rights issues for decades. People have been waiting for this game to hit the market again since the 80s, and often printed up their own versions, and there's been an active tournament scene. It is a game that has withstood the test of time and then some.The art, layout and build quality are excellent. The cutouts from the battle wheel also give you extra blank tokens, which are good for homebrewing or simply making additional trackers or tokens (I used mine to make tokens showing the benefits of controlling certain strongholds, which can be passed to the player controlling them). There's a lot of information that is displayed clearly and concisely, it looks beautiful doing it, and the materials are all built to last.I do have a few nitpicks in the design. First, the faction tokens which sit in front of each player are in the middle of a ring around the board where the storm tracker goes, forcing you to move it out of the way when they overlap. It's a harmless annoyance, but it was also a completely avoidable design flaw. Second, the orange and red factions are just a little too close in color, and in a dimly lit room, they can occasionally be confused at a glance. Third, there is a phase tracker on the board but the token that travels along it is not included for those that didn't pre-order, and even we didn't get a fancy 3d printed sandworm, a simple cardboard ring would have been nice. And I've seen several groups that highlighted the line marking the borders of Fremen staging grounds, which should have been a clear part of the map or at least given as a map in a reference guide for the Fremen player to be able to see (I made one from a small printout of the map).But as I said, these are nitpicks, the kind of thing I would like to see fixed in future releases but not any reason to hold back now.The PublisherWhen I got the game, I found several components were damaged (seemingly in manufacturing) and contacted the publisher. They responded quickly and sent replacement parts in the form of a mostly complete game which had almost certainly been a return, but which had all the items I needed essentially untouched. Except the board itself was more damaged than the one I had. After contacting them again, they rushed out a new copy of the game rather than risk another problem.Excellent customer service that focused on resolving the problem and which went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of.The GameplayThe majority of the game revolves around bidding for treachery cards (equipment), landing and moving troops, and resolving battles.* The bidding phase has players take turns bidding or passing on face down cards, with the card going to whoever has the highest bid once all others have passed, an auction with the structure of betting in poker. Each turn will have a number of cards up for bid equal to the number of players that aren't at their hand limit, so just enough for everyone to get a single card in theory, but.* The movement phase lets players land a single stack of troops in any one territory on the board (except in a storm or a stronghold with 2 factions), limited only by the cost and the number of reserves they currently have. They may also move a single stack of troops on the board, allowing them to attack enemies, gather spice (money), or simply move to safety. You only get one landing and one movement per turn, so despite all the depth of strategy, turns are fairly quick and the choices are often agonizing.* The battle phase resolves those battles set up in the movement phase. Each battle happens on two levels, the troops and the leaders. Each player puts together a secret battle plan consisting of the number of troops they are willing to sacrifice, the leader they are sending in, and any treachery cards they want to play, mostly weapons and defenses. If a weapon is played and the other player does not play a corresponding defense (ranged or poison), the targeted leader is killed. When the plans are revealed, add the number of troops sacrificed to the bonus from the leaders if they survived, and the side with the higher number wins. The winner loses all the troops they sacrificed, the loser loses all their troops and any equipment they played, and both sides keep their own leader if they survived. And if the leader they played is the one whose card you secretly chose from 4 dealt to you at the beginning of the game to be your traitor, you can negate the entire battle, wiping out their side entirely while losing nothing.* You win the game by holding three strongholds by yourself at the end of a turn or four strongholds between yourself and an ally at the end of a turn.What makes those interesting are the unique factions.* The Atreides can look at the face down cards as they are being bid on, and have a reliable income selling information both before and after the bidding, and they can ask to know one part of their enemy's plan in every battle.*The Harkonen get double the treachery cards and four times the traitors, and after winning a fight they can kidnap an enemy leader or just kill one and sell its corpse.* The Fremen don't have to pay to bring in troops, can move faster in the desert, are resistant to the hazards of the dessert, and have special forces that count as double troops.* The Bene Gesserit can compel opponents to play or not play a specific card in a battle, get free charity every turn, can choose to be noncombatants to peacefully coexist with other factions whether they like it or not, and can turn worthless cards into miracle cards.* The Spacing Guild takes its movement phase whenever it chooses rather than in the turn order, pays half price for landing troops, and is the one everyone else pays when they land troops* The emperor has special forces, and is the one who collects all the money paid for cards in the bidding phase.There's more, but you should be able to see from the summary above that the interaction of these factions is fascinating and dynamic. Especially since they can ally with each other and share some of their advantages.And of course, the special victory conditions are great. The game has a 10 turn limit. If no one has achieved victory at the end of the 10th turn, and no other special victory conditions are achieved, the spacing guild (and ally if any) wins for having maintained the status quo. If at the end, the Fremen (or no one) have control of their ancestral strongholds and no great houses hold the smuggler's stronghold, the Fremen (and ally if any) wins for having kept the outsiders from taking control. And then there's the Bene Gesserit, who at the beginning of the game choose a faction and a turn number. If that faction wins on that turn, they have played into the manipulative hands of the Bene Gesserit, whose carefully prepared schemes come to fruition, granting the Bene Gesserit (but NOT their ally) the true victory (possibly my favorite rule in any game ever).TL:DRGet this game. Play this game. Love this game. It is an experience that you simply cannot pass up, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.

  I'm very happy to have this items in my hands when I think always wanted to play, because I have a friend who knows the 1979 edition and I heard from him.How ever, he insisted that ""$ 50 for it's expensive!"", which was my concern, but, when I opened the box of the 2019 edition, I was very satisfied with the quality of the components.For example, the thickness of the cards is very thin, but not flapping, tokens and game boards also seemed to use very high quality materials, and it comes with a tray to hold each component.I will attach the picture of the contents for reference.

  This game is massively complex and completely on brand as an adaptation of the epic Dune saga. It works just fine as a two player game: Atreides vs Harkonnen. I highly recommend you do a few play-throughs of the Basic Game before tackling the Advanced rules. Beautiful game board and quality tokens. The game box has a tray to hold the blivets sorted by faction. It's not for the casual boardgamer or fan... If you like Fantasy Flight style games with many moving parts and complex multi-stage turns, give it a go.

Beautiful reprint with streamlined and clarified rules you can probably get for under $50
","

  This is a beautiful reprinting of the 1979 original which was then printed by Avalon Hill. This reprinting, in addition to the absolutely beautiful and stylized art throughout, clarifies some rules and provides both a basic and advanced play option, complete with a quick start guide. They've also streamlined and clarified some rules, as well as made various balance changes both overall and faction-specific. Presumably this will lead to better game play (and definitely faster games with the maximum number of game turns being reduced to 10 from 15 in the original), but I haven't played yet to verify. Also if you were really invested in getting the 1979 experience but don't want to track down a beat up original copy, the original rules are available online and this game will pretty easily facilitate that with some small changes (like providing the Bene Gesserit a way to pick up to turn 15 as the end turn). Cardboard is sturdy and nice, much more resilient and with better tactile feel than the original.So the bad for me is, first and foremost, I'd like a little more contrast on the game board itself. The colors on the cards and tokens are great, but then the board itself, while stylized and fitting for the game, isn't quite as easy to glance at and pick out all the important details as I would like. Some borders seem a little difficult to read, especially with how irregularly shaped they are, and certain graphics sort of blend in when they should stand out more, I think. Maybe my opinion on this will change from an actual play through, but my first impression is that it could be a little easier to read with more contrast/color to some graphics on the board.Secondly, the spice tokens are utilitarian and the least beautiful part of the game to me. They do their job, but considering the special place of the spice in the Dune universe, I want these to feel like more than bulk coins even if that's all they are mechanically. I'll probably replace the cardboard chits with plastic ""shards"" of some sort that look appropriate.Lastly, the price. I got this from GameNerdz for about $38. There was a deal at the time, but I don't think it was 50% off as a preorder. Shop around a bit before committing to a listing almost double what was available.

  What an absolutely amazing game, Dune is one that you'll never fully learn without repeated plays.  Until then you will be constantly surprised and at times a little confused as to how everyone interacts and how best to triumph in this epic fantasy game.  Having some base knowledge of the Dune franchise goes a long way into introducing new players to this game and having them being fans of it make it even better.  I love this game, but a player with no knowledge at all of Dune before your bring it to the table will have a harder time getting into it.That aside, for everyone else who knows and loves Dune you will find one of the most amazing gaming experiences of your life when you get a full table of friends to play this.  An epic battle will ensue where knowledge is power, bribery is encouraged, and treachery is to be expected.  Your first game will be on the longer side of things as everyone familiarizes themselves with locations, movement, battle, and other phases of gameplay, subsequent games though have a very satisfying flow and harmony to them.  This is in part of how amazingly balanced and well designed this game is.Beyond learning the rules I cannot think of areas of the game where something goes wrong or doesn't work correctly, things are fair and one faction’s weakness might be later in the game offset by an alliance with another faction.  The combinations, decision making, and tactics are endless and aside from the end game objectives being ""mostly"" the same each game will feel like its own unique experience.  This is one of those games you'll remember stories about and retell them later, as you're setting up you'll recall who betrayed you last time.  Repeated plays of Dune take on a life of their own and builds an ambiance and mood around the game that you just can't get enough of.I'm very happy with all the components and art style of things, the box is great looking and the rules although confusing on a first read through are laid out very well and explain most everything.  My own personal wish and the only con I could think of would be that I would have liked a larger playing board and some larger fonts used on the sector spaces.I often don't even think you can call Dune a board game, as it so much more than that.  The amount of player interaction, alliances happening, and exchanging of vital game information all going on around you make this almost akin to an RPG in a very loose use of that term.  Win or lose, I've never not enjoyed this game, and while it is not one I would play all the time the infrequency of how often Dune comes to the table makes the anticipation of the experience that will no doubt unfold be all the greater.  A great game and definitely one to add to your shelf.

  Dune drips with theme.  It's, in a way, an open world game of alliance and intrigue.  On its own it's a great game, but if you read the books the rules are way easier to learn because they make sense, giving the faction you play almost a role play feeling.  The mechanics are balanced pretty well.  If playing less than 4, my friends decided to leave alliances out.  In one game I tried the Guild, and thought I made a bad decision by turn (round) 2 as I thought I clenched victory in less than 15 minutes.  But I hadn't, and I hadn't. The Beni Gesserat at the table was able to thwart my victory with voice and dealt a major blow.  After that we went about 4 or 5 more turns before someone (not me) was declared the victor.  Until the game ended all my moves felt critical, and kept me on edge.  In the end, it was a memorable, exciting game that made me want to play more and try different factions or the same ones.  I recommend this game for its overall unique game play, heavy thematic elements, and excitement that comes with having your faction advantages or falling victim to another faction's abilities.

  The true test of a board game's greatness is if you have a good time when you aren't winning. I've played twice, lost both times, and had an absolute blast.I would however reccomend you have a stiff drink at the ready for when your first two battles end in betrayal, the sand worm eats all your troops, and someone blows up the shield wall while launching the storm half way across the map to finish wrecking you.I think the beauty of the game comes from two sources. First, the fact that wildly asymmetric factions are wonderfully balanced. Strategy comes not from doing the same thing as your opponents except better, but instead from boldly playing to your opponent's and your own strengths and weaknesses. The second thing that makes this game great is that victory usually feels just barely out of reach. This lets you scheme for the win throughout the game.

Most fun I've had with a board game in a long time.

  Dune is both simple and complex at the same time with more back-stabbing and backroom deals than most other games I've played; not for those who want co-op games.  I've spent hours and hours playing it and teaching it to others (I ran over 200-players through games at Gen Con 2019).  The rules are simple and concise.  I've found that the best games we've experienced were with an even number of players (2, 4, or 6) but odd works too.  Don't be afraid to try different combinations as allies (Atreides and Harkonnen are a powerful if not unexpected combination).  And use your factions special abilities to their fullest.

  This is a great game that I spent too much time playing while at university in the 1980s -- now reissued after being unavailable for many years. I need to look at the rules to see if there are any changes.  We tweaked some of them ourselves back in the day to reign in a particularly overpowered character (I'm looking at you, Harkonnen) and improve the game dynamics in other ways. So my advice is don't be afraid to tinker with the rules if you need to. Nothing is carved in stone! Enjoy.

  Av excellent reprint of a classic Avalon Hill title. My main complaints with this game are that it requires some time and play-throughs to get a feel for all the moving parts, capabilities of all the factions, and careful attention to the mechanics. Our first 3 games went less than 3 rounds, but still took the better part of 2 hours with 4 players... Now that we're experienced, I think we might actually be able to pick up the pace and have a more challenging competition; but, I would still recommend changing one mechanic: allow each unit of forces to move (spread out) independently, every turn, once on the planet. That being said, this game is the truest adaptation of Herbert's classic in game-form I have yet encountered: you really can recreate the events in the books, and a whole lot more! The difficulty is all in the learning of the nuances of the rules, which are well balanced, but not as clearly explained in the manual as they might have been... I actually spent about an hour or so, annotating in the margins, so that I could better explain how the game was supposed to run after the first run-through crashed, with cooperative victory (due to all of us misunderstanding some important features) on round 2 (this game is engineered to expect 10 rounds of play). If you love the DUNE universe you may have the determination and commitment to develop an enjoyable competence to play this game: it's just not something you can easily introduce others to, ad hoc. Nonetheless, the Advanced rules version is much more satisfying. Strongly recommend outlining the area on the board where the Fremen-faction can spawn troops (highlighter or metallic marker), for ease of all.

  Uno dei miei giochi da tavolo preferiti in assoluto fa il suo ritorno trionfale sulla scena. Dune è un gioco di strategia ambientato nel mondo di Arrakis e vede varie fazioni, gioiosamente asimmetriche per forza e capacità, sfidarsi a colpi di battaglie, alleanze e tradimenti per conquistare il pianeta. Detto così, sembra una variante di Risiko, ma è molto di più. Vi basti sapere che non ci sono dadi per decretare il vincitore delle battaglie e che ogni fazione è realmente diversa dalle altre e perfettamente in grado di vincere. Questa versione è rispettosa dell'originale Avalon Hill di moltissimi anni fa, senza rinunciare a una veste grafica rinnovata e leggermente più moderna. Per me, promosso a pieni voti!

  Gale Force Nine hat es geschafft einem absoluten Klassiker neues Leben einzuhauchen. Das Spielmaterial ist wertig und macht einen langlebigen Eindruck, und hat auch ein ansprechendes Design, aber das ist Geschmackssache. Manko an der Verpackung ist wieder dass keine Druckverschlussbeutel mitgeliefert wurden, aber irgendwas ist ja immer.  Über die Qualität des Spieles sollte man sich am besten selbst ein Bild machen und sich eine ausführliche Rezension oder ein Let's Play auf Youtube ansehen. Das Hauptmerkmal in diesem Spiel ist wohl asymmetrische Strategie, wem das zusagt, und die Tatsache dass man seine Freunde zu einem min. 2  (aber eher so 3-4) Stunden Spiel überreden muss, für den könnte dieses Spiel was sein.  Die hohe Komplexität, grade mit den erweiterten Regeln, geben auf jeden Fall Wiederspielwert. Mir hats definitiv gefallen, aber ich bin auch Sci-Fi-Fan und habe gute Erinnerungen an das alte Spiel.

  This reprint of a forty year old game is still great and one of the best asymmetric strategy games - especially with higher player counts.

  Played this with my mom tonight. I had watched a video of how to play beforehand, and I have played the video game so I had a pretty good idea of how it would go. Still, I thought it would be a lot harder to explain to my mom who hasn't had any experience with the game or area control games than it turned out to be. We had no problems figuring out how to play, the game loop is very fun, well written rules and the few problems we did have were easily found right away in the rules. The artwork is exactly what you would expect, functional and does the job just like the video game. High quality parts and some nice little details like the ""death"" dice has little red blood splatters on it. We both had so much fun and I can't wait to play it again with more people! I have a feeling this is going to end up as a top favorite for me on game nights. :) 10/10

Fun game for the family!
","

  Our family loves playing board games. I bought this to take to my sister's house and we played a round. The directions are a little bit hard to follow, but we figured it out by playing the game step by step with the instructions and then played a round without them. It was just as fun as the video game! We all loved it. You definitely need more than 2 people though to play or else it really doesn't last long. We will be bringing this to all the family gatherings for sure!

  The pieces are translucent & colorful. Very satisfying to look at. The art for the board & cards is very nice as well.

  It may not be as fun during the current CORVID19 outbreak, but in general - it's fun. The quality is good, the rules are clear and simple. Can be played for up to 4 players, or singleplayer (which is very unusual for the board games). I played this game on PC and spent good time. The board adaptation is as good as the PC original. They are very different, though.

If you like Pandemic?
","

  This is a really fun game unlike Pandemic the players play against each other. It's nice to work with everyone in curing a disease, but sometimes it's more fun to win by eliminating everyone else. In fact, once one player can't play anymore the game stops. If you see you have and advantage and can knock out a player earlier then you can do that. There are a lot of different ways and variations in playing Plague. The material is solidly built and should last a long time.

  Will and Grace Season 7 is wonderful.  This is a show that could go on forever, but what we have for archives are precious.  The humor is funny and uplifting.  The story lines are creative considering they were in their 7th year and trying to keep the central theme since season one intact.  The divorce of Grace and Leo is sad but continues with the purpose of the show. Jack and Karen are at their best and Will has definitely developed into a strong character.  Grace was weaker in this season, but still a strong figure for the series.

Excuuuse Me! This is still a good season!!!!

  I don't understand why the person above me thinks this is the season where it goes downhill.  Did people notice that Friends was not so funny after its 6th season?  And that in its 10th season, it was really just scraping the bottom of the barrel?  W&G, in its 7th season, may have lost some of its ""HO-MOJO"", but altogether, still pulled off some great writing.The show peaks from seasons 1 to 6, but bounces back with an even stronger 8th season, which, I am hoping gets released soon.I have never watched a television show more times.  The cast is unbelievably talented and they all seem to have grown more naturally and maturely towards portraying their characters as the show progressed.  None of them ever ""acted"".It is arguable that most of the time, Jack and Karen were the ones that were funniest, but without the balance and sanity that Will & Grace  provided, the whole thing would have been a vain and ludicrous showcase of a flamboyantly gay satire.As a gay man, I find this show doubly appealing.  Not only is it hugely entertaining, but it also conveys several positive messages: that Homosexuals a)can be successful and productive members of society; b)are just like everybody else in that they value friendships and relationships; c)are people too and that they should NOT BE TOLERATED but EMBRACED; d)are truly members of the superior race because they enjoy the best of both worlds, are hilarious and great to live with, and, have impeccable taste!!!Finally, one of the most touching scenes (season 8/A Little Christmas Queer) was when Will asked his mother why she cheered on her 9 yr. old gay nephew's christmas show while she ruined every one of his productions when he was a child by being so uncomfortable and unsupportive.  She replied, ""because back then, I didn't know the kind of person you would turn out to be.""Will & Grace will always be remembered as a show that mattered and broke ground because not only did it make us laugh and cry with delight, but it also made us think about how we are all wonderfully unique, and how, at the same time, we are also still one and the same: HUMAN.

Still worth your money
","

  In this season you can tell the cast is beginning to grow tired of the show. The writing is also not at it's best. However, this still remains one of the best shows to grace the T.V. screen. There are a few standout episodes and the characters begin preparing for Season 8, their final season. I particularly felt 'Grace' led many of the episodes in the season. While she isn't my favorite character, I felt she helps make this season more enjoyable. Definitely worth your money and certainly a must for any collecter. The Thanksgiving episode with 'Vince's' family is one of the best of all 8 seasons, which makes this a must have! Will & Grace' remains a winner!

  I purchased this game for 5th and 6th grade students to play.  I put the box out and the kids opened it up and began playing.  I did not see that a sample of the game ""Relative Insanity"" was inlaced in the 5 second rule box.  The cards are the same color and look like they could go with 5 second rule.  The sample cards were extremely inappropriate for kids.  This game sample should not be included in a kids game.

  The language used on the cards of this game were NOT even close to appropriate for my 10 year old and not even the kind of language I would want to encourage for my 14 year old. ‘I need a drink’. ‘Everyone in her hometown knows what she looks like naked!’  ‘I’d rather pee on an electric fence than wake up next to her’. Just examples. Just beware for younger kids.

  Whoever invented this game is clearly into sports, especially at a college level. This is not something our family cares about in the least, but I purchased the game on sale, so with some handy Avery Brand labels, I created some questions that were suited to our family interests and would make this game more fun for our group. I'd say if you can purchase the game at a deep discount and have the means to alter the cards for some broader questions, it's well worth your time and great for some laughs, too. I dropped a star for the sports/universities overload, but if that's your thing....add the star back as this would be right up your alley.

  The idea of this game is good, however it is NOT worth it. I bought it for my grandchildren for christmas and when my 12-year-old grandaughter told me she wanted to spend time with me I was stoked. We opened the box and where immediately disappointed when we looked at the timer. THERE WERE NO BALLS IN IT! The point is to give three answers about a subject before the balls in the timer hit the bottom. How do you play the game when there are no balls?

5 Second Rule Game is Awesome 👏🏻

  Wow! I am so happy I brought this game up to our Cousins Reunion! The game was a great ice breaker with all the Cousins! There were many that I never met or did not really know well! ! It was a hit with all the adults and kids! (Family friendly version) The game is very easy to play (especially when the adults had one too many to drink (not the kids!))We made up our own rules:Basically, one person is the judge per round. The judge picks a card from the box of cards and reads it aloud! The person to the judges left is in the hot seat and has to give three answers under five seconds. The game comes with a five second timer that gets turned over immediately after the judge reads the card. The person on his left must answer within the allotted time. If not, the card is returned to the back of the box of cards! However, if the person gives three answers, the timer is turned over again for the next person to give three different answers from the first person. This continues until someone makes a mistakes or has a brain fart and is stomped! When that happens, the card is given to the LAST person who gave the last three different answers from anyone else. The game continues until someone accumulated six cards ! We could not stop laughing!I highly recommend this game if you want to have lots of fun!

  My 10-year-old loves to play this game with me and my wife, and it's surprisingly challenging to come up with 3 of anything in 5 seconds.  And even though this game is pretty difficult for his 5-year-old sister, my son started coming up with categories of his own on her level.  The card might say ""name 3 pro soccer players"" Or ""name 3 sci-fi movies"", but my son decided to put the card down and make up one for his little sister.  He said, ""name 3 Dora the Explorer characters.""  The intense focus on her face and she scrambled to name 3 characters from one of her favorite shows in only 5 seconds... oh, it was just fantastic.  And reading the cards themselves as I play with my 10-year-old is fun too.  Sometimes he comes up with things I figure he'll never be able to think of.  It's a fun little game that encourages family time.  I love it.

The Kids Inspired My Decision To Buy
","

  We’d been gifted this game at our school age center and for a few days, it sat on the shelf until one day I decided to play the game because I’d never heard of it and wanted to see what it was all about.  So I invited a few of the kids to join me; after the second or third round of playing, we had lots of kids standing around wanting to get in on the fun too.After playing it a while at the school age center, I decided to buy one to add to my home collection of games.  When I went online to make the purchase, I found out the UNCENSORED VERSION was available too, so I got that as well. The kids really enjoy playing this game (and so do I) however, the most fun happens when we create our own “Name 3...” items.  All I can say is, I enjoy playing them both and on occasions, making up my own “Name 3...” items as well.

  I bought this after watching the Ellen show. It’s that hilarious in real life, lol. I really like the timer thing, but it would be nice if it made a sound or something when it was finished - you have to really watch it to figure out when time is up. But better than a 5-second hour glass I guess.This is a great social game. The questions aren’t very hard (usually), but your brain freezes up, which is the hilarious part.This version isn’t good for kids. It’s not NSFW, but they don’t know what most of the questions mean yet. They make a kids version.We use the adult version and kids version together on family game night to keep it fair.

  I would rather have communicated directly with the seller, but I couldn’t figure out how to do that so here goes: I purchased this as a gift but can’t bring myself to give it to the intended recipient because it looks like it is old and used.  The box is dinged up and dented, and the color on the box is worn or scratched away in many places.  It looks like something you might have pulled out of a toy chest after years of use.  I still think the game looks like it will be fun so I will just add it to my household game collection, but I am disappointed that it arrived in such bad condition.

  I purchased the 5 Second Rule Game for my family's holiday party and it was a purchase well made. It was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and had a blast playing. The rules of the game are pretty straightforward. We had kids as young as 9 to adults as old as 60 years old playing. The only con is that we went through the cards pretty quickly because of the number of people playing. I looked on Amazon and there aren't additional ""play card packs"" you can purchase to add to the cards that come with the game. Maybe I didn't look well enough but that would be the only negative thing I have to say about this game. Other than that, this is a must-have game to play with your family, friends or even an ice-breaker game for events and team building.

  My grandson is 9yrs old and he loves it.  The only thing is some of the questions are a little advanced for him, so we just add card back into the used pile. But he loves it.... Some of the questions are very, very easy, although between the pressure of answering the question, the sound of the beads going down the timer, it amazing how many questions you miss that a 2yrs old would know... It definally makes for a fun game night..I would suggest the child be at least 6yrs old, but they will definally enjoy it.  I also found if you take the question on the card and kinda reword it, they will be able to answer them......

Pieces are easy to put back in the box between plays, which eliminates lost pieces:cards. Topics are varied. There are two questions per card..which makes playing with children easier as their life experiences are not as plentiful. There’s never any grumbling when playing is suggested-everyone plays. I’m 60, my children are in their 30’s and my grandchildren range 10-16...we all enjoy playing. Helps develop reading skills and gets everyone thinking/recalling things and events.

Fast and Fun game for 3 or more players

  You ask a question and the player needs to provide 3 answers in 5 seconds. There are two questions on each card so you can choose the most appropriate question for the person. The Ball tube timer is fun!  For the price, the family had a lot of fun.  I would definitely buy this as a gift for ages 9 to adult.  Could be brought to game night without having to censor cards.

  After buying one of these games I played it with my 8 year old grandson first, with a few changes. (I only required 2 of things, not 3.) We both laughed so hard, to tears. Had a ball. Then took it to our family Christmas gathering. Everyone participated, laughter was uncontrollable. After we played the planned number of rounds, everyone wanted to just keep playing. No one wanted to go home. Senior adults, adults in their 40s, teens and grade schoolers, everyone had a blast. So I bought this one to give as a gift.

Captures the Essence of the Video Game Perfectly in a Streamlined Board Game
","

  Absolutely fantastic! It really delivers that classic civilization video game experience in the format of a board game. Obviously, there have to be major differences to allow this format change but it capture's the games essence very well. Like the video game, it's complex with endless choices and possibilities, yet also streamlined and very easy to play after the first play-through/learning game.Pros: - Very fun, games typically take around 2-3 hours which is not too long, but long enough to feel like the world/game actually evolves - Captures the video game's essence very well - Endless choices and possibilities - Map creation element generates countless random maps for a different setup every game - Turns can happen fairly rapidly, so you don't need to sit around waiting for other players too longCons: - Tons of pieces/tokens and the box doesn't come with anything to store them and keep them separated - Setup takes quite a while (at least 15 minutes) - Wish the game supported up to 6 people (hopefully there will be expansions!) - Wish there were more victory scenario options - Rule-book is a little more complex than it needed to be

So many pieces
","

  Very involved, steep learning curve, all the pieces! Many things to keep in mind while playing, many ways to win, never the same game twice, very versatile game board, many different leaders and wonders that give handicaps or benefits that change even more aspects. All of these features mean you have to keep in mind a lot of details and make this game something you'll play with the same people over and over, it's not a quick board game for a party. They did a fairly good job of keeping a lot of classic civilization functions in a board game format. Good quality materials, pieces function well, but you may want to purchase a lot of little zip lock bags or some sort of organizer to help with game set up. There is one red wonder that seems to put the win in the bag for the player who gets it first. This one allows any card's action to be played a second time if you originally played it in the fifth slot - this basically means you play twice every turn if you set it up right and gives a major advantage that does seem unevenly overpowered compared to other wonders. No regrets in buying this though.

Streamlined, but still sluggish
","

  The good:* A fast-paced strategy game that captures the ""feel"" of playing Civilization on the computer while taking less than 2 hours.The bad:* Looooong setup (30+ minutes), even if you're sticking to the ""For Your First Game"" map in the rulebook.* Lots of easy-to-forget rules. Even after several play-throughs, I have to look things up constantly. For example, how much defense does a target have? If it's a barbarian or a token, it's the terrain value. If it's a city, it's double the terrain value, unless it's a city-state, in which case it's 8 (?). The backs of the leader cards provide a quick-reference for the victory conditions; for everything else, you have to break out the manual.* Combat feels like an accounting exercise. You each roll a die, and then you add all your bonuses: ""I have 4 from my tech, 2 from this wonder, 2 from this city-state,"" ""I have 3 adjacent reinforced tiles, 2 from this wonder,"" etc.I was excited for this game at first, but after a few plays it doesn't feel worth the effort. If you're interested in this genre, I'd recommend Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy.

  Great job translating the PC classic into an awesome tabletop game. I was really surprised by the pace of the game and how smoothly it moved along. Combat was a bit too simple for my tastes, but there was still plenty of strategy involved in gameplay. An earlier reviewer commented on the amount of pieces (there are A LOT), and while I solved the organization problems by sorting them into sandwich baggies, there were a lot of sandwich baggies. Hopefully this helps speed up setup, as I put the pieces for each player in it's own bag. In spite of the volume of pieces, during play they weren't encumbering in any way, which made everything a breeze. Really had a great time playing with my teenagers, and I hope you do too.

  My wife and I ordered the game some months back on a sale, but it sat on our gaming shelf for a little while before opening it up at a game night with friends. The rules were fairly simple, but there were some layers of strategy. There were only a few mistakes we made (Using caravans to pick up resources), but we were up and running after a few turns.My only gripe is I was missing a complete set of orange caravan pieces.

  What a great game! Setup takes some time but moves much faster once you get the hang of it. The learning curve is based mostly around the cards, which detail the actions you can take each turn. Knowing what they do and how to upgrade them throughout the game takes a lot of time during your first few games, so plan on 3+ hours, possibly 5+ if you have four players all learning together.I'm really disappointed with their support, though. Two of the ""Tech III"" cards have a printing error, switching the military art and title with the Industry art and title. I reached out and they flat out refused to fix it, and they aren't fixing it for future prints either. If you buy this, prepare to be disappointed in the inaccuracy.I'm also assuming that expansions are out of the question, which is really unfortunate. Don't buy this if you're looking for future support.

  If you enjoy Settlers of Catan or 7 Wonders, Civilization a New Dawn is a logical continuation.  There is a little more substance than Catan or 7 wonders, however, it is not as heavy or complicated as it’s predecessor.  For best enjoyment, do not attempt to compare it to the 2010 Civilization Board Game. Each is very different, each takes a different approach to capture the Sid Meier’s Civilization theme. I would recommend both to your collection. Civilization a New Dawn is a great game if you want a reasonable quick civilization building game. The game is relatively easy to learn and the focus row component is an interesting addition to the game.

Love everything about it... except the game itself
","

  This game was definitely made by fans.  The Delorean.  The Clocktower.  The fading picture.  It's all here.  Unfortunately this game is super swingy.  I've played plenty of difficult dice chuckers, from Elder Sign to Pathfinder Adventures, but this one seems exceptionally punishing.The game manual itself recommends that you spend early turns doing side objectives in order to build up extra powers for future turns.  Extra powers=more actions per turn.  The problem is, everything in the game (except for movement) is done with a dice roll and there is a 1/3 chance that you roll a Biff, which not only fails whatever it is you're doing, but also causes Biff to set you further behind.  So in the crucial first turns of the game you can complete challenges and gain 1 to 2 extra actions for future turns or you can fail the challenge, waste your turn, still be stuck with the starting 5 powers, have the trouble card messing up your game because you failed to clear it, AND have Biff set you further behind.Even fighting Biff is a dice roll, so if Biff is causing too much damage and you try to stop him, you can roll even more Biffs.  This can lead to a completely unwinnable situation within the first several turns. I had a two-player game where it ended with the love meter at -4 (the lowest it can go, you need 13-15 to win) AND the Delorean still in the starting space (we did get the 3 car parts at least).  That is not just losing the game, that is elderly grandpa fighting Mike Tyson levels of obliteration.  It was not even close.I've been trying out different house rules to figure out the best way to play it because the theme and components in the game are fantastic.  If you're a Back to the Future fan, pick this one up.  If you're looking for a good co-op game, try Horrified or Pandemic.

  I am a huge fan of both Back to the Future, and table top board gaming.  I am no stranger to games that are made out of an existing franchise.  Sometimes it is done very poorly, and sometimes it is done well.  This game does a good job!  When you turn a story into a game. You have to capture the essence, while not making it a boring game.  It can't be too word for word the movie, and it can't stray too far from the source material.It is clever to have Einstein and Jennifer join the group so you can have a 4 player game, and not have it restricted to 2 (Marty and Doc).  Unique abilities with each player make replay a must.  The randomness of the challenges, and perks you can acquire can really make the game a nail biter.  Our first play through it was down the wire.... and we lost!  I still had so much fun.  The board is a very cute representation of Hill Valley, even complete with pop up clocktower that doubles has a dice tower!!!! So well thought out.I love that as you continue to fail your main objectives, the iconic family photo begins to show Mary's family disappearing in a clever way.The components are nice, the Delorean is detailed, the character models are unique.  This game has a great art style that is it's own but pays a good homage to the artistic direction of the movies themselves.AND I CAN'T FORGET The rule book is disguised as the comic Tales from Space featured in the film!Even the board has a nice visual queue when opening for the first time as you get a nice shot of the flux capacitor.All in all this game is fun to play, follows the narrative well, and is a great cooperative experience for you and your friends/family.  Working together is what makes this game great!

  Bought this game as a gift for my husband for Father's Day. It was a BIG hit and we had such a fun time playing it as a family.It's cooperative, so you're all on the same team working together to get George & Lorraine to fall in love, the DeLorean fixed up and into position in time for lightning to strike at 10:04pm, all while dodging Biff and his gang who are out making trouble.It's super theme-tastic, and we were up on our feet shouting at the dice by the end of the game. SO much fun!!

Requires house rules
","

  Theme alone is 5 stars. Combine that with excellent components (also 5 stars) and you really feel like you’re in the movie!Well you would feel like you’re in the movie if the film ended with Marty failing and disappearing out of existence in 1955. Gameplay is a 1 star. It is incredibly punishing for anyone that isn’t insanely lucky (which I’m not). The first play through (2 players) ended with the love meter at the starting spot, the delorean almost to Doc’s house (halfway to where it needs to be to win), and the only accomplishment being that we collected all 3 parts. Our second game (3 players) ended 3 rounds before the endgame when everyone quit because realistically there was no way to achieve a victory - we were just too far behind and every roll just set us back further. I don’t think this game was playtested for balance, and that is a shame because clearly a lot of time was spent on components and theme - it does such an amazing job of honoring the film.Without house rules this game just isn’t fun. We tested house rules like rerolling one biff, or when you acquire a power tile you can immediately use it, which helped the experience.I hope there is a second edition at some point with a rule adjustment, I love Back to the Future and good strategic co-ops, so I want to be able to love this game. Fingers crossed.

  What’s not to love about a Back to the Future themed board game? The components are fun, and although it may look daunting to infrequent board gamers because of all of the different pieces, it is not that complicated. We highly recommend the advice of the game makers - complete the opportunity challenges first thing.  You need the extra power tiles and items help, too.  Focus on the love meter and get it moving, and keep an eye on what is coming up on the time track.  It’s true that luck of the die plays a significant role, but efficiency in accomplishing the two main tasks (moving the love meter and moving the Delorean), rolling extra dice (for the wildcard lightning bolt), and active coordination and sharing power tokens in clutch moments, really help. We played three times and won each time, without resort to House rules.

Back to the Future in a Box!

  Sure, my headline is the most cliche, clickbaity thing you can think of. However, I truly feel transported into the movie when I am playing this game. This coop board game will get you and your friends and/or families high-fiving when you complete a challenge, but flipping the table when Biff comes over and messes you up.The lovely designers of Prospero Hall have knocked it out of the park with this one. I have played Jaws before and knew when I saw this new release that they would do the IP justice. I had just watched the movie a few weeks before playing the game so my Back to the Future fervor was at an all-time high.First off, the game is pretty simple to learn. Your character has several ""power tiles"" at the start which tell you what you can do on your turn. On all the starter ones, you can either move or use a dice in a ""challenge."" You'll be running around the board trying to gather parts for the Delorean and ensuring Lorraine and George stay in love before time runs out. What's not to love?Well, good ole Biff is running around trying to ruin your plans. And oh man, if you hated him in the movies, you'll hate him even more in this game. Everything you do, he is there ready to reverse anything you've done. Whenever you do a challenge which typically involves helping George and Lorraine or trying to pick up the parts, you can roll ""Biffs"" on the dice which will move him towards George and/or Lorraine. When he gets to their spot, he will drop their love on the love meter. You need to keep this high but he will be constantly lowering over and over again.I don't want to go over all the rules, but I'll say for the price, the components are really good. The art on the cards is not just movie stills, but instead are custom images made for the game. I haven't assembled the Clock Tower dice tower since I heard it is a little fragile, but everything else is great quality. Pick this up if you are a Back to the Future fan!

  In the last year 2 games have come out that have been affordable, kind of by the same people, and have become my favorite games. Horrified was the first and this is the second. The components are great, rules are explained well, game play is fun and easy to learn, and somehow they've made the theme come alive. The game has you allocating dice to challenges while avoiding Biff who is on the board and moves around trying to take away your progress.Note that this can be challenging, especially for people who do not play a lot of board games. IMO I still think that if you do fit into this category and find it difficult and you keep losing I would hang in there. I believe that the game is so sound and fun that even non-gamers wil get better at it and find winning doable.

  Neat game that captures the up and down edge of your seat type feeling which was constant throughout the movies.  The artwork is really great also.  Having watched the movie as a kid it was a neat little adventure “back in time”.My only beef, and thus the four star rating, was the poorly designed clock tower dice tower which is kind of a pain to set up and make use of due to poor design.  Midway through our first game we just stopped using it.  I guess at this price point some corner cutting is to be expected on a board game with this many components but it’s unfortunate something like that is ever noticeable.

Not only a good Back to the Future Game (finally) - but a great co-op game!

  This game is an absolute blast- let me tell you why.  First off- game is well designed with player powers- and power tiles that turn into dice rolls/allocation or other powers (like rerolling the dreaded Biff dice rolls- or more movement).  The game takes place in 1955- and the kitch-art is awesome- and the look and feel of the game just oozes with theme.  The four main characters to play as are Doc, Marty, Einstein, and Jennifer. (i know Jennifer & Einstein weren't really there in the film- but it works in the game)  They are all super different with asymmetrical powers- and each really lends themselves to securing victory by either moving the DeLorian, helping George and Lorraine fall in love, or scare Biff away.  Cool small opportunity cards pop up over the town- allowing you to level your character up- and the cards bring up some of the best moments in the movie!  This game is a 5/5 for me- but warning - it's not a cake walk! I've won only once out of five games- but when you win- it feels awesome.

  We love cooperative board games. And the theme of this game is a perfect fit for cooperative play. You work together to get George and Lorainne to fall in love and get the DeLorean to the starting spot before lightning strikes the Clock Tower. It's a dice rolling game, so there's an element of luck that makes every game turn out differently.The first time we played, we cruised to a victory. But the next time, we were failing everywhere. And it always has us wanting to play again.See our full review on The Board Game Family website.

A fun throwback adult party game, best for 3-8 players
","

  This is a fun little slant on the game we are all totally familiar playing from middle school in the eighties and nineties. It is definitely a party game with many options for modification and new experiences every time you play. This is a game for two to eight players – but we have found it is definitely more exciting of a game if there are actually at least three or more players because of the rules as they are written, and honestly four or more is optimal. Here’s how it works: you can play it like the original MASH game (there is a scenario card for that), but there are also a big stack of double-sided scenario cards that give you everything from a ted talk to having to show up on a game show where players choose from a handful of ‘answer’ cards and submit their answers (there are also customizable scenario and answer cards). Then, the person who’s turn it is selects the card that is their favorite out of everyone’s submitted answers, sort of like apples to apples. They then draw a circle with a dry erase marker to get the magic MASH number (like the old way of playing), and a count is done to find the correct answers for the person’s scenario – there is also a point system, and that is what makes it a game of course – if the person who’s turn it is selected your card through the MASH magic number counting, you get extra points than if they just land on a random card.Overall, it was pretty fun. I mean, playing MASH as adults, especially with significant others in the room is a little weird, right? Not to mention that it is free to play and doesn’t require much more than a pen and a pad of paper... But this offers a lot of customization, a lot of different scenarios and answer options that are pretty funny (and that you don’t need to come up with on your own, if you don’t want to), and a points system so you can play it like an actual game that one of your party guests can win. With the apples to apples aspect of the game, playing with the personal knowledge of your competitors allows for a fun dimension to your choices. Oh, and it all fits in a box small enough to stow away on a bookshelf without being obnoxious – always a plus!A fun game!

It really helps to know MASH already
","

  I have to imagine that someone who played MASH as a kid would find the game more fun and the instructions less confusing, but I had my age-diverse group of friends and family read the instructions (none of whom had ever heard of MASH before outside of the TV show from the 60s—and that's including people from twenty-somethings to sixty-somethings), and they were all pretty confused at first. It became clearer as we went through and tried each stage, but we all came up with much better and clearer ways to explain the game to the uninitiated, and much more fun ways to play. We all tried actual school-room MASH, and this game is more adult, as advertised. In the end, this game ended up being way more fun when we dispensed with the rules and turned it into a weird version of Cards Against Humanity. The instructions need to be rewritten. Remove everything from the instructions that isn't absolutely necessary, because right now they're full of extra information and some poor explanations, and it makes everything overwhelming. One consistent suggestion I received was to include a link to a video of original MASH being played alongside this new version, because the whole game became instantly clear when we watched MASH videos. I guess none of us ever came into contact with MASH in the classroom. The cards and pieces themselves are quality, so no complaints there. It's definitely well made. It just isn't well explained. I have to guess that only those with high nostalgia for the original paper version would have any real interest in this one, because it didn't end up holding any appeal for my group. It's certainly interesting to a point, but it seems to require some nostalgia to really enjoy.

  All in all we were disappointed in this.  The cards are flimsy, the storage tray is a really thin plastic.  For the price?  Maybe that's okay.... but definitely my first thought when I opened the box was that it was inferior quality.As for game play - yes it is fun and nostalgic but there are not that many different cards so after a couple plays this game will become redundant.Recommended for a joke or a memory-lane recollection but I do not believe this game will become a smash holiday hit.

  I got this because I was hit with the nostalgic bug when I saw it. I LOVED playing MASH when I was younger. This just doesn't compare though. It was a little too complicating and had things that were a little dumb. I am hoping once I play it with more people and maybe after a few drinks it will be more fun? Otherwise I think there are MASH apps or websites that you can go to where you can more easily put in exactly the things you like for better outcomes. I think this was trying to be a mix of MASH and Cards Against Humanity but it just didn't work out well in my opinion.

  When I was a teen, we played MASH, though we didn't call it that. I think we just called them fortunes.  Then when my daughter was in middle school, MASH was very popular and it was referred to as MASH. She had preprinted sheets that you fill out and an electronic version. She's now in college. She and her friends have had a blast with this updated version. The first time they played, the followed the rules. Since then, they've been playing the fortune part, but they have skipped some of the formal rules. It's still a lot of fun!

Really poor production for a great game
","

  I'll start by saying that this game is fun and a really good one. However, for the price that I paid for this game the way that it came produced (or should I say NOT produced) was a huge letdown. Most strategy games that I have played look good, are packaged well, and are produced well from the game box, to player pieces, to game board. Terraforming Mars, however, was not made this way.First of all, this is said to be a five player game, yet I only had four actual game boards. In order to play with five people, I literally had to take a game board and color photocopy it onto computer paper. How can a company charge $40+ but not include enough game boards to actually play? Even the game boards that were included (the four I received) are on a thin photo-type paper, not even on cardboard! Secondly, all aspects of the game pieces and cards were shrink-wrapped, and didn't come with enough bags (five total) or rubber bands (none) to keep everything together.

Must have game!  Mediocre component quality.  Sub-par box and cardboard insert was destroyed by poor shipping.
","

  This is an incredible game with a very cool engine building mechanic that offers tons of choice.  We received it this morning and quickly played it twice.  I, already, cannot imagine my game library without it.  It would rate 5 stars were it not for the component and packaging quality.Online reviews had prepared me for mediocre component quality and poor artwork.  Component quality was as expected yet still mildly disappointing considering the cost of the game.  The board is a lighter weight than that of most games I own and I feel like I must be super careful when unfolding it to keep from accidentally tearing it at the scored spots.  The player boards are printed on a pretty flimsy card stock but nothing that can't be improved with some laminate. The box, however, was sub-par and the clever but cheap cardboard tray inside was destroyed by shipping.While my first impression was that the game board was small and drab, I quickly realized that the board was perfectly sized.  Much of the game is played out on the tableau of cards each player creates in front of themselves and on the player boards that they use to manage resources.  The game board is primarily used to track victory points and the game ending parameters by placing various tiles and player markers on the surface of the planet.  The drab topography of Mars quickly fills with colorful tiles and and player markers and looks very impressive by the end of the game.The only real problem lies with the packaging.  The box is of a lighter quality that most of the games on the market and does not need to be nearly as large as it is.  It is much to large too hold the folded game board securely. They try to account for the small board the larger box with a clever cardboard tray that is cut, scored and folded to hold the board floating in the middle above a center area intended for the other components.  The tray is printed to look like the surface of Mars and would be quite neat were it not printed on such a cheap grade of cardboard that it was destroyed in shipping.  The game board and components are too heavy for the tray and a good shake (like a kid with a Christmas present or a UPS deliveryman) will cause the heavy components to destroy the tray that holds them.Again, I consider the game to be a must own.  I do, however, suspect that I will wish that I had waited for the second edition with improved components and packaging.  When you shell out $60.00 for what essentially amounts to an intellectual property and some cardboard, you should get quality cardboard!

Great game with poor quality components
","

  I waited for this game for quite a long time. After playing for the first time, I can say that the experience was worth the wait. I love the theme of the game - taking on the role of a corporation working on different projects in order to make Mars habitable for life.The gameplay is fun and has depth. It's an engine builder, in which you try to up the resources you produce in order to work on projects or plant greenery, etc. I really enjoyed playing the game.I had to dock a star due to the quality of the components. I have a fairly good sized board game collection, and I must say out of all of the games I've purchased, some substantially cheaper than this one, this game has THE worst components. The cards are nearly paper thin and flimsy. I had to sleeve them to be sure that they'd last multiple plays. The paint started flaking off the metallic cubes after ONE playthrough. The player mats could seriously benefit from an overlay. But worse than that is they're also very thin and flimsy. The box itself doesn't seem terribly sturdy. For 50+ dollars, I certainly expect better quality. At minimum, the paint should not be flaking off the cubes. They will probably need to be replaced eventually.Finally, the art direction on the game is a really questionable mishmash of stock photos and art.So while this is a really fun game and I really love the theme, this game could seriously benefit from a second edition with better components and better art. It seems like this game was produced the cheapest way possible. At least this game has really fun gameplay as its saving grace.

Cooperative competition, well balanced, fun, and highly nuanced game that begs successive replays.
","

  A superbly designed game that lends itself to a great deal of replay-ability. A lot of people have bemoaned the component quality here, and while I would have appreciated the player mats being a little more robust, it's really a minor quibble with an otherwise well designed game.  This is a collaboratively competitive game, which means all players are working towards a common goal, the terraforming of Mars. However, only one winner will prevail at the end of it. Every player represents a different corporation, and this is where the game really shines. Every corporation has a unique strength that informs the strategies it may best apply towards winning. There is a massive deck of cards representing ""projects"" you can build or events you can fund during your turn, and the ideal is to create a bit of an economic and/or resource ""engine."" However, this is by no means the sole path to victory, there's a tile placement land-game going on here too. The beauty is you don't have to follow any specific path towards victory, and that is what makes a good game to me. Many of my friends have commented that they are already looking forward to playing it again before our current session is even complete. There are so many potential synergies here that it can take a few plays just to start to get the hang of the opportunities at your disposal. I would recommend this without reservation.

I usually don’t jump on on the bandwagon of the hottest new board games, but this game is an exception.Pros -The theme: It is a very refreshing unique theme that keeps you engaged  (who doesn’t want to be apart of making Mars a great place to live).Replayability: This game never plays exactly the same each time you play. Each game you end up playing different cards, plus you have a unique corporation that gives you an advantage in some way. There are also multiple paths to victory. I have played games where I won doing a specific strategy, but then other games I use the same strategy only to be beaten by someone with a completely different strategy.Options: There are many options of what to do with your resources in order to get points, no matter how many resources you end up with there is always something you can do. Some options are clearly better than others (but the better ones cost more, so it balances out). This adds a lot of options to your strategy, you can go for the short game, or be in it for the endgame points.Science: This isn’t really all that important, but many of the science ideas on the cards are pretty accurate. As a science teacher, this is an added bonus to know that you can play board games and learn some real science!Cons -Materials: The player mats and cards are a little thin, but it isn’t really a problem for gameplay. I just worry about the lifetime of the components. I actually laminated some player mats to make them more durable. Sleeving the cards could also help protect the cards. Also, the player mats have no way of holding the resource cubes in place so if you are not careful a little bump can mess up your player mat.Rules: Although I think the gameplay is easy to follow once you understand the rules, getting to a full understanding can take a little time (partly because there are so many options). First time I taught this to a new group it took about 30 minutes to fully explain the rules. Make sure to give the rules a good read through before you bring the game to the table. It helped me to watch a few run-through videos online. The game does include some quick help cards which are very useful. This game is definitely best for teens or adults due to its complexity.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys medium to heavy euro style games and wants a new refreshing theme. Some people say the game can be too mean, but I don’t think that is the case. Most of the mean actions are optional and only affect other players in minor ways. My wife dislikes any game that can be too confrontational, but she is always willing to play this game with me.

The game itself is enjoyable and I would recommend it; however
","

  The game itself is enjoyable and I would recommend it; however, (1) for the price, the components are very cheap. Player mats are nothing but flimsy, glossy paper. During the game someone will eventually bump the table, displacing the tokens on everyone' mat, and (2) The tokens/markers/currency cubes are pretty terrible. You get bronze, silver, and gold cubes that represent 1, 5, and 10 dollars that act as currency and sometimes resource tokens. The cubes themselves are hollow plastic that can easily be dented, especially in the corners. Plus with this currency system, it seems an abnormally  large amount of time is spent exchanging cubes for smaller denominations when making a purchase.Additionally, two of my player mats were warped when I opened the box for the first time badly enough where they don't sit flat on the table and can't be used; I contacted Stronghold games directly and they promptly said they'd send out replacement mats (9/20/17), but nearly two months later I have not received them. There is no insert inside the box, you receive an empty box with bags of the game pieces just thrown into it. I like the game but pretty disappointing quality for the price.Update: Contacted Stronghold Games about the damaged player mats on 9/20/17, sent a second email on 11/25, both times I was told replacements would be sent, but as of 1/31/2018 I still haven't gotten any.

Amazing game
","

  If you're looking for a really deep board game - this should be your next purchase. I had heard good things about the game from a few people, and it had good reviews on board game geek, so I decided to give it a shot.BUILD QUALITYWhen it comes to the quality of the pieces and board, it's a bit of a mixed bag. The board itself is perfectly fine. Can't complain. For the player pieces and the currency pieces, these are actually quite nice! They're little colored cubes - some are translucent, others are a little shiny. I'm actually a fan of the pieces.My biggest complaint with the build quality, however, is the player sheet every player gets. This is where you track your ""production"" and your resources throughout the game. For starters, this sheet is a little confusing. My bigger complaint here, though, is that a portion of this sheet is dedicated to show how much of a given resource you earn every round. To indicate this, you put one of your colored player pieces on the designated number. The problem, though, is that the slightest of bumps on this sheet can slide the pieces around, meaning you can turn your production from a 3 to a 4, which can have a pretty big impact. I would have loved to have seen a physical slider piece, or little slots to hold the pieces.This complaint is not a HUGE deal, but probably my biggest concern with the build quality.INSTRUCTIONSI have to admit, when you first look at the instruction manual, it's pretty overwhelming. There are about 20 very dense pages of instructions to read through which walk through the mechanics of the game. It took myself and 4 other people about 2 hours to digest the instructions. We found ourselves referring to this manual often over the course of the game. The manual isn't the best organized, so answering a specific question about the game can often be trying to find a needle in a haystack. Further, the wording in the manual is often a little bit confusing and tricky to understand.One aspect of the instructions that I like is that they have a ""beginner"" version, which is recommended for the first time you play. Essentially, this gives every player the same ""corporation"", which removes some of the variability but makes it a bit easier to learn the mechanics of the game.MECHANICSThis is where the game really shines. While there is definitely a learning curve to this game, it offers so much variability in the way you play the game. There are numerous way to increase your ""Terraform Rating"" (aka, your score), and these actions you take ultimately progress the game in a super natural way.There is no designated number of turns that this game will last. There's no timer. There's no countdown. Instead, you are progressing towards making Mars into a ""viable planet"" to live on. You do this by increasing temperature of the planet, increasing the number of oceans, and increasing the percentage of Oxygen. The actions you take throughout the game may do any of these 3 things, either directly or indirectly. Sometimes, there are even moments where by increasing the temperature you increase the Oxygen level.Another really interesting aspect is the concept of a ""generation"". A generation is more or less a round of the game. Within each generation, every players takes turns. Each turn consists of up to 2 actions per player. Players continue going in a circle taking their actions until they have no further actions that they want to take, and they ""pass"". Once every player passes, the generation is complete.One dynamic I noticed is that the early generations of the game take quite awhile. People are figuring out their strategy, and are building the economy. However as the game progresses, the generations start to move very quickly and the game's resources start to increase at a must faster rate.Overall, the game probably took at least 2 hours to play.REPLAYABILITYWhat made this game so interesting, was the 2nd time I played. The first time was certainly fun, but was generally learning the mechanics and the basic strategies. For the 2nd time playing, though, we understood the main goals, but more importantly, we used the more advanced corporations. These corporations offer even more variation and customization about how you want to win the game.This type of strategizing is what really sold me on this game.CONCLUSIONUltimately, this game is quite complicated with a hefty instruction manual and a steep learning curve. But with the endless possibilities of how you want to play the game, the level of strategizing really outweighs the upfront cost, making this a really rewarding game to learn and to play.

Extremely poor production quality. Possibly Scamazoned
","

  I have not seen production quality this bad since the Knight Models harry potter miniature game. The cards are barely cards at all. The player boards are just thick paper. All of the plastic cubes are chipped before you even open the bag. Even the punched cardboard tiles are about half as thick as tiles for other games. The box it comes in is thin and easily damaged. Whoever produced this game ought to be ashamed of themselves for cutting every possible corner available. This game is $50 yet must have cost less than a dollar to produce. I will not buy another board game on amazon again. I seriously hope this is a fake.

This is a great game, but..
","

  I reviewed this game once before when I only played it twice, and I feel I didn't give it a fair review based on two play-throughs.My two biggest complaints I had then still hold true now after giving this game another few more plays. One thing that did change was my overall opinion of the game.My first complaint which seems to be common amongst other reviewers is the player mats. They're pretty terrible. They're slippery and your resource tokens will easily slide if you're not careful. So, be sure to remember where each are placed throughout the game, because if you accidentally knock it, then you're up the creek. So not only do you need to pay attention to all the other game mechanics and rules, you also need to memorize where your cubes are on the mat.My second complaint is the rule book. The format of it is awful, and isn't very good at teaching you how to play the game. I recommend watching videos how to play in addition to reading the rules. This helped me immensely. Which leads me to my conclusion.I actually really enjoy playing this game now that I have a full grasp of the rules. I'd say it's one of my favorites in my collection. I just hope that Stronghold will address these issues, or at least the player mats if they ever do newer editions. A better written rule book, and player mats that are more like the player boards for Scythe would give this game a solid 5 stars.Because of these two issues I have, I'd say this game is a 4 star rating.

Great theme, okay game
","

  Great game concept, so-so components.Pros:Real science. The concept behind the game is that each player represents a corporation vying to colonize and control a new colony on Mars. Melt glaciers to make lakes, dump algae in the lakes to promote biodiversity, crash an asteroid in the planet to help warm the surface. Every single card in the game is based on real or near-future science.CUBES! So many cubes. Each player gets little cubes to place on their playmat to track their production of steel, power, metal, and other resources. You also collect metallic cubes to represent money. Don't forgot the cubes to track the overall progress of Mars- you track how many generations (turns) you've been playing, temperature, humidity, and oxygen content in the atmosphere. SO MANY CUBES!There's a great sense of progression in the game. Everyone is always doing something, together or alone. You're mining steel, you're generating electricity, your electricity development creates heat, your heat melts ice, as ice melts you can do more biological projects. There are so many feedback systems, so many ways to progress. It can get easy to forget about the main board where you're supposed to track the progress of the planet, because you're so busy with your own playmat.Mars. I mean it's a game about Mars, with a large 4-piece board to represent the red planet, and a lot of real science about how humans would colonize Mars. The theme is ever-present, and some people are really going to dig that.Cons:Player mats are a real problem. The game would benefit hugely if you could use a free map to toss out all the cubes and track things electronically. The problem is that the playmats are cheap paper. This means it's easy for cubes to shift position due to a bowed sheet, or if you bump a sheet you lose a lot of information with no real way to put it back together. And that's the real core of the game- you do a lot of work on those cheap sheets with some little plastic cubes, making it hard to justify the cost of the package. Another idea would be if they could do a dual-layer cardboard player mat, so there would be individual wells for the dice to sit in and they can't be jostled out of place so easily.Overall:I feel like this game needs a Second Edition. Give me a cheaper map of Mars because you don't really interact with that, but better playmats since that's where you spend all your time. The end goals of the game are also a little weak. At the last minute you have to wager on whether you think you can win certain awards- such as generating the most of certain resources. By the end of the game you probably already know who's winning what, and wagering earlier in the game would mean you'll fall too far behind to keep up with other players. So the end of the game could use a little strengthening.The concept is there. Lots of players have a lot of fun participating in all these systems and pushing cubes around their mat. I also didn't have any problem with the art- a lot of cards have really bad stock photography, where most games coming out today have expensive custom art on every card. The rest of the cards have custom drawing and art which is only so-so. If there were a Second Edition, the game does need a more consistent art style, but that's a minor concern. If you like Mars, if you like science, if you like cubes- give it a try.

Super fun, highly addictive
","

  Each year I buy a new game for the family. This one is by far one  of the best I've ever bought. It's a bit complex, but that helps make it more interesting to play. We didn't have anyone to teach us to play, so the initial start up took about an hour , but tonight  I taught a friend ( who is NOT a big gamer)  how to play and she understood the process in less than 30 mins. And, agreed it was a great game!We have a lot of games on our shelves and over Christmas this was played nearly a dozen times. What's nice is that it's not easy to figure out what exact steps you need to do to win, that is there are many different ways each person can approach the game and each time we play, the winner has taken  a different approach to how he/she collected Victory Points. It's also nice that it has a beginner version (to help ease you into the game) and a Solo version, which is quite challenging. My son is already looking to purchase his own copy to have at college.Very pleased with this purchase overall and will likely look into getting expansion sets in the future.

Fantastic gameplay but physical components leave quite a bit to be desired
","

  This game would be good for you if:- You are a board game enthusiast- You find strategy games fun- You like playing the same game multiple times- You like depth in your gamesThis game would not be good for you if:- You get frustrated by games with complex rules or many winning strategies- The idea of taking 2 or more hours on your first play through to learn the rules and develop your strategy is daunting- Good artwork is a necessity for your enjoymentI really wish that I could give this game a five star review. It is without a doubt my favorite strategy game to play and it's a game that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any board game enthusiast. Unfortunately, the physical components of this game are well below par for a game that costs north of $40. The box itself has no organization for the board or pieces, it is literally just a box with everything you need to play inside of it. That drawback though is only the beginning (and the first thing you notice when you break into the box).I absolutely love the design choice of using cubes that represent ""one unit"" because the game itself has quite a few resources. Because of that, using cubes for ""one unit"" instead of one type of marker for megabucks and another for plants is extremely efficient. However, board which you use to keep track of all your resources is literally just a piece of cardboard. When someone accidentally knocks the table when they stand up or sit down, all your cubes slide and now you have to remember where everything was supposed to go. There are third party solutions for this (clear plastic covers which have wells for the cubes), but for a game at this price point, I would have appreciated a solution for this in the game itself (even if it meant being $5 more expensive).The game itself can be played over and over again with as much (or more) enjoyment on every sitting. On the game design alone, it is undoubtedly a 5 star product. I just wish the components lived up to the gameplay.

  Great game with lots of flavor.  I love the artwork and texts on the cards.For example, you can crash Deimos into Mars to raise the temperature, and the flavor text reads ""We didn't really need that moon anyways""  :)The only annoying thing is how easy it is to mess up your trackers on the player boards.  There are some great aftermarket overlays to solve this though.

Great game with some production quirks
","

  First off, this game is a lot of fun and worth buying. In my mind, it is kind of like a mash up of Settlers of Catan and Twilight Imperium 4.The only gripes I have are with the quality/design of some of the components. The cubes used for resources are plastic with a very thin metallic covering that will most likely come off with time. The marker cubes (same as you'd find in a game like Pandemic) work well, but they are used to mark various resource production levels on the player boards and at least once per game they'll get severely jostled and go everywhere. Good luck remembering where they were after that. There are some other components that appear a little cheaply made, but for $40 this is still a great value considering how great the actual game is. Hopefully the manufacturer invests a little more in quality for the eventual reprint.Also, the prelude expansion is highly recommended to reduce the drudgery of the first few rounds.

Awesome game of strategy and timing with some small production issues
","

  The premise:You are playing a corporation that is assisting to terraform Mars so it can be inhabited by humans. The way you win the game is by being the biggest contributor to the terraforming process (having the highest Terraforming Rating or TR). Your corporation produces steel, titanium, plants, energy and heat to help you accomplish completing projects that contribute to the terraforming of the planet.Pros:- Strategy and timing are essential and luck plays only a small part (based on the cards you are dealt).- There have been several negative reviews of the artwork on the cards but I disagree - I think they were well thought out (for the most part).- The game board that comes with the game provides great artwork as well as milestones and awards you can achieve during the terraforming process.- There are two expansions that add a lot more choices to the projects you undertake (Colonies & Venus Next) and tend to make gameplay more interesting.- There is an expansion called Prelude that gives your corporation two head starts that is well worth the price- There is an expansion - Hellas & Elysium - that are two new game boards with two different locations on Mars that add variety as well as different milestones and awards.Cons:- There is a steep learning curve to this game - especially for new board gamers.- The player mats are NOT well thought out. You use cubes for everything you do and you keep track of your production of steel, titanium, etc. using them. If you bump your player mat, cubes go everywhere so you have to be really careful. To remedy this, there are several homemade player boards out there that contain slots for the production cubes to prevent scattering them when you bump your mat.- There are not near enough cubes provided. We end up using $1 megacredit (currency) cubes to make up the difference. I contacted the company by email and they responded that there are no plans to provide extra cubes as an 'expansion' or in the game itself. I think this is a mistake but I'm glad they at least responded to my email.Summary:Despite the problems with the mats and cubes, this is one of my all-time favorite board games. There are some in-house rules I think are essential. The drafting of project cards is a must and we also deal more corporation cards and Prelude cards to choose from as well.I would give this game 4.5 stars if I could because of the player mats and cubes but this game is an excellent strategy game that will remain in my favorite games list for years to come.

  First of all, i removed one star automatically because shamefully cheap components. Shame on you publisher and developer for money grab there. Developer is raising a kickstarter to sell you better components for the game, with 3d tiles. Board games a hobby, it goes against the spirit of that to offer poor component quality, no matter how good the game is.  That said, game is somewhat random card game with tile placement. if you could get into mood of terraforming and forget that this is essentially one million cube engine building, you may like it. Rule book is horrible, let me repeat, rule book is horrible. You need to watch Rodney Briant's how to play video to play this game. removed another star. Look at Dune boardgame for a good rulebook with quick start. in essence, i dont recommend unless you have interest in the setting.

  There is a massive learning curve when trying to play this game. In fact, after two attempts at playing it, I still don’t know if I get it completely. Every action card is different, and each rule just poses more questions about the dynamics of how that card affects other game rules. With such a dense set of rules, answers are hard to come by, and sometimes you and your fellow players may just have to agree on how you want things to be played in order to keep things moving. I’ve only ever played with two players, and man, this game is LONG. You should expect to settle in for about 3.5 hours, maybe longer. There are so many aspects of the game that aren’t covered in the instructions; for instance, some cards tell you to collect random resources (separate from those on the player cards) on that action card... what are these resources? How do you collect them on the card? We decided to just use the bronze markers or the plant markers and move on. We also ran into issues with how to handle the play phase with only two player. Some cards say you can add a resource as an action. So if the other player keeps passing, then you can keep adding resources to those cards seemingly indefinitely. We eventually decided that each player can only do that once. I bought this and Lords if Waterdeeo at the same time. I actually thought I would like this game much more because I’m a big science and space nerd, but with how long this game takes, and how much of a big question mark a lot of things are, My partner and I actually passionately prefer Lords of Waterdeep to this game. We get the shudders just thinking about trying to play this game again. For $45 this makes me sad. The box is okay but then there aren’t even places to hold and organize the many, many, MANY, pieces that are involved in gameplay... you just toss them in some cheap plastic baggies. Lords of Waterdeep has a lovely custom-molded insert that keeps everything nicely organized for gameplay. Anyway, I hope I can re-sell this game. My advice is to find a friend who has this game and try to play with them first before investing - I wish I had done that myself.

  I hate to leave a 1 star review, but the component quality for the second print run is still abysmal. Nearly every plastic resource cube is scratched and chipped around the corners. The quality of the card stock for the player mats and cards is the thinnest I have seen. The box is flimsy too. If this was a $20-30 game the components would be okay expect the chipped cubes.  I paid nearly $55 at the time of purchase.I contacted Stronghold games to try to get replacement cubes.  I had planned to keep the game because of the excellent reviews and BGG ranking.  This was their response:""Tim,Thank you for your email.  We are sorry about your disappointment with the cubes.  We do take all of theseconcerns very seriously.The manufacturing process for these cubes, which is a double layered plastic injection mold, is very complex.This process causes some chipping on these cubes, especially around the point where the cubes are ejected fromfrom the cube mold, but also in other places as well.  This is unavoidable in this very new and complex processthat we are using, which are likely the first in the industry to execute production of metallic bonded plasticcubes.We apologize for any disappointment you have with these cubes, but we can't replace them.  The game play,of course, is fantastic, and Terraforming Mars has already received many accolades already (including Top 10 game of all time on Board Game Geek, Dice Tower Award for ""Strategy Game Of The Year"", Meeples Choice Award for ""Game Of The Year"", Kenner Spiel Des Jahres nomination for ""Gamer's Game of the Year"").I am sorry you don't feel the quality of the other parts are good.  We respectfully disagree, as we know that they are.  For instance, the cards are 300gsm black core cards, which are of the highest German quality - which is where they came from - and are the same as all of the cards from games printed at Ludofact Germany, the largest and best printer in the world.We are sorry that this game doesn't meet with your approval for production quality, but we have a fantastic game here for gamers.  I hope you will appreciate the great game play as you explore this amazing game system.""--------The excuse the company uses for the poor plastic cube quality is a joke.  Stronghold is not the first company to produce plastic cubes.  Funny how everyone else can make them correctly.  Not only are the cubes chipped, but as you lay them out the paint flakes off onto the table.Included are photos to show how the cubes looked.  If it were just a few I could accept things, but this is throughout almost all of them.  I matched up a Magic the Gathering card over a Mars card to show the weird cut.  The other photo shows how thin the player mats are.  They are slightly thicker than poster paper.

I will Terraform the heck out of you Mars!
","

  This game was given to me on Father's day 2018.... it quickly became my favorite game to play.  At this point, I have probably played Terraforming Mars close to a hundred times.  The sad part is, I don't usually win, but I LOVE to play again and again.  There is a great mix of LUCK (what random cards will I get) and  SKILL (knowing what cards to play and how to utilize them to benefit you the most).  There is such a randomness about this game that it feel FRESH everytime I play it.  It will take 1 or 2 games to fully understand Terraforming Mars - this isn't Connect Four, it is a complex game with many components.As I said, every game is fresh and exciting... depending upon what Corporation you start out with and what bonuses you receive and then you get into what cards will I get in my hand.  You have to learn to filter out cards that may be GREAT, but have a global requirement on them that may not be met for quite some time vs cards you can use now. Do you invest in the future buy purchasing this card, but not getting any benefit from it now... or do you conserve that ""money"" to invest in cards that can be used now and give you a much smaller push.The goal of the game is the have the HIGHEST Terraform Rating at the end of the game and as a group having met all 3 global requirements (Oxygen level, Temperature, and 9 Oceans).  Many activities can help to raise that rating - some card raise it, moving up any of the 3 global requirements, and at the end of the game there is PUSH of Terraform Rating by tallying how many forests and cities you have placed - and by what achievements you purchased earlier in the game.  I've played games that I SWORE I was about to win and then my wife or son would pull out an upset victory as we tallied up Terraforming Points from card bonuses, and achievements that I apparently didn't calculate into my ""master plan to win"".The game is really fun and to top it off... they have made numerous expansions for it.  Each expansion adds new elements to the complexity of the game and a variety of new things to do to help you win (or in my case LOOSE  ;) )How long does it take to play this game?  Well we have played 3 and 4 player games  and most seem to last for 4 - 5 hours.  Time FLIES as you play though.I would recommend sleaving the cards to help preserve them.  I have also noticed that some of the money cubes are loosing their paint - in particular the copper colored ones.  And as you add more and more expansions, the box gets pretty full (but that really isn't a bad problem to have).  The player mats were my biggest complaint...  you track your resources here, but stuff moves way to easily on these boards.  The most recent expansion ""Turmoil"" fixes this problem by giving you new mats that have plastic grid that help to hold your counters - very nice.

  We had never played this game before but a friend mentioned they’d played it and loved it on social media so we thought we’d give it a try. Not a whole lot else to do in quarantine. Had to watch some YouTube videos to figure it out. Would be easier to learn if you have someone who has played before to show you but we figured it out w the YouTube videos. Our 10 year old plays w us too. It can take literally 3 hours to play though so great for quarantine but not a quick game. I like how there is a beginner “mode” and other ways to start as well. I hate that these kinds of games are so dang expensive but what we paid for it I wanna say was actually on the low end for these types of games (if I remember correctly we paid $40).

  There is no denying this is an excellent game.  By that I mean the actual mechanics and gameplay are deep and thoughtful. The components are an embarrassment. There is no box insert, so it's just a bunch of plastic bags sliding around. The component quality is also poor. Many of the punch-outs tore the art despite great care in popping them out. All the components feel cheap and flimsy. Even at $39.99 this game is overpriced for the quality.  A shame that such a great game is hampered by low quality.

Incredibly well-balanced game in need of a ""premium"" edition.
","

  As many have already pointed out, the component quality is OK at best. We bought custom 2-layer player boards and a generic parts storage container, and they very much improve the experience.However, I'd still highly recommend it, because after several years, this is the only long (>2 hr) game I've consistently been able to get to the table. What amazes me most is that even among differently-skilled people, it's still rare to achieve a runaway victory. In most cases, the score difference between first and last place has been about 10%, and we've had several cases of winning by one point out of 100 or more. It never developed the ""we'll play, but we already know you'll win"" mentality that many of my other favorites fell into.To me, that's strong evidence of an exceptionally well-balanced game.

Awesome game! Great Solo-mode! Sadly sub-par bits & pieces
","

  TLDR: The game is awesome!  However please note the parts & pieces are pretty sub-par (this is a legit copy)Recommend purchase only when it goes on sale.Pros:This was a legit copy, and I confirmed by tearing open the blank card and it did indeed have the ""black"" core.Instructions were pretty clearly written.Solo-mode works pretty good!There are a lot of cards in this base game which to me means lots of replay-ability!Cons:The player board is flimsy/thin paper and I really wish it was thicker (may invest in 3rd party overlays)The bits are also sub-par, upon opening up the box, there were some of the plastic cubes that were chipped (bronze money cubes) and as mentioned by other reviewers overall poor quality.The art/photos on the cards are a mix-bag, wish there was more consistency; i.e. all photos or all artConclusion:I would not pay full price for this game...Wait for it to go on sale...However despite the poor quality components, this is a good game with solo-mode!

Do yourself a favor and watch a video before trying to read the rules

  Like this is a fantastic game. But the rules, the emblems, and how the cards are written are complicated.Every player will need to be fully educated in the rules to really enjoy this game.And it is a fantastic game, but the English rules are overly complicated and have points in the rules that refer to other sections of the rules and make the initial read/play terrible.That said, I managed to teach my parents to play this game and it is fantastic almost like a competitive Sim-City like game and every project has really cool functionality.The base game comes with a mini-expansion ""The Corporate Era"" which has more of the competitive attacking cards. Less to say if you have no clue how to play it might not be good to play with these cards. But the symbol is hard to find if you don't read all the rules.Fantastic game, rule book is hard read, but overall a great 2 hour game.

Cool game....crappy quality
","

  Game looks great but came damaged. Bought this as a gift for my husband and when he opened it we both got the feeling this game had been previously used and repackaged for sale, despite the fact that it was sold as brand new. Many of the game pieces were chipped on the corners (see picture). Amazon has been doing pretty bad at packaging items for shipment this past year too, as with this and other purchases the box it was shipped in had almost no cushioning to take up the extra space and looks like this resulted in the corner of the game box being damaged. You don’t expect to buy a gift and get it in a damaged state, especially for the cost.  Other reviews from Amazon say similar things about the quality of the components being subpar. We did not have a cardboard tray with ours like other reviews mentioned.Still despite this the game seems pretty fun and we are looking forward to playing it.

  Purchased Nov 23, 2018, have played this countless times. Mostly with 4 players but often just 2. Enjoyable either way. Game time was a bit long at first (4 hours) until you get the hang of the game and now can play it usually in 2 hours. Plenty of cards to keep replayability fun every time. Prelude expansion is a must have and haven't played a game without it since. The extra board expansion is nice to have but not necessary at first until you've played a couple dozen games and want some variety. I bought a Monoprice Select Mini 3D Printer pretty much to print out 3D tiles for this game and they add so much to the style. Looking forward to trying Venus Next and Colonies expansions that are coming with my Turmoil kickstarter pledge.

Satisfying homage to  Kim Stanley Robinson and a great resource-management board game
","

  Easy enough to learn if you are already familiar with other tile/resource type games likes Settlers of Cataan. Clear enough to play. All players, as individual corporations, are working together to terraform Mars, increasing its oxygen, water and surface temperature. They are also competing to see who can make the most profit along the way and who can control the largest share of interests in the planet's wealth. As you place tiles and purchase cards, your resource production increases in one of several areas, such as money, metal, energy production, etc.My 10-year-old and I demoed this game at our local game store and immediately purchased it on Amazon, because the game is so popular our game store had been unable to get new copies for many months.The icing on the cake as that the game celebrates Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars books and for fans of those, this makes it all the more tasty.The mechanics are straight-forward enough and yet there are enough options and decisions to make to keep you thinking.

Fun, involved, strategy game.
","

  Fun game but definitely set aside a chunk of time for the first time you play. It’s a rather involved game, with a lot of “moving parts” or concepts to understand.... so I would say probably for older teens and adults just b/c there are so many cards that can change play and how points, resorces are earned. Lots of strategy involved which can be good or bad thing depending on your personal preference. It is nice that they have a way to simply for first time or new players. Due to this, this game could be played multiple times and I doubt it would feel like you are playing the same game over and over.The reason for 4 stars is that the small plastic game pieces move on the slick, laminated tracker cards and so if you bump the table you could lose track of your resources. Also the cubes used for money have chipped in the corners. I understand there is a game adddition to help solve these issues but would have been great if these issues were taken care of by the original people who designed the game.

Lots of replay value
","

  I played this game at a party, and ordered my own copy as soon as I got home. Although you are obviously in competition with the other players, I like that there is a shared objective, and the scoring method makes it very hard to know who is winning until the points are tallied. There is not a lot of opportunity to sabotage the other players, so it makes a great 2 player game. After all, who likes making their spouse rage-quit a board game? The rules are pretty easy to pick up, and it comes with an expansion deck to draw it out into a longer game. The basic rules probably takes 1.5-2 hours for 2 players, with the expansion and all 5 players, expect to be at it for closer to 4 or 5. All in all, a great game for those who like engine-building/resource allocation games.

  This game does take some time to understand but if you have the time, the more you play it the more fun it is.  It is also one that changes each time you play it so one strategy may not always work each time you play.  I like challenges and having things be different so it's been fun to play.  In order to do it right, you need at least 2 hours per game even after you've learned how to play, but if you enjoy games like Pandemic or Ticket to Ride, then you will also enjoy this one as well.  Highly recommend!

Fantastic game to play, quality of cards/markers is meh
","

  Fantastic game for 2 to 5 people.  Most games for 2 to x are just ok with 2 people but this one is just as great with 2 as it is with more players.  I only gave it 4 stars as the quality of cards, and markers are sub par and their is no organizer for the game.  After ~10 games, the card ends are fraying.  If you are ok with card sleeves then this isn't much of an issue but we don't like to play with sleeves.  As so many others have mentioned, the markers start chipping and slowly lose their finish.For organizing the game, BrokenToken makes a fabulous organizer.  It makes setup and storage so much faster, so much that we play the game more often because the setup is so fast.  The individual trays keep the markers in place if you accidently bump them as opposed to the thin cardstock that comes with game.

  This is a heavier boardgame, so not for those not familiar with modern games.For the gamer, there is nothing new here as far as the rules go.  It's a rather typical, do something to get different kind of resources to build an engine that lets you get more resources mechanism.  Pretty standard fare.The reason this gets 4 stars and not three, is the nice theme, and the real science that seems to be on the cards.  That makes it enjoyable.

  My wife and I absolutely love this game and play it with friends and family at every opportunity.This is a verified, legitimate product of Stronghold Games. However, our copy of the game contains hexagonal tiles with significant printing misalignment. In fact, most are misprinted to a greater or lesser degree. However, these aesthetic defects do not in any way detract from our enjoyment or love of the game. I do not consider the manufacturing defects to be significant enough to warrant taking off a star. I do wish Stronghold would up their QA standards though.

Great game, even with cheap resource pieces.

  Terraforming Mars is a game where the players are taking the role of corporations tasked with terraforming the planet Mars for future colonization. Players produce resources and income that allow them to take actions and play cards raise the temperature, create oceans, and add oxygen to the atmosphere. While players are working together to terraform the planet, players are scored based on their contributions to the terraforming efforts (and some other scoring mechanisms) to declare an overall winner.It looks complicated, but it’s actually pretty easy once you understand the rules. The challenge is using your resources most effectively while anticipating what other players are planning so you can play off their terraforming efforts. Because different corporations and certain cards have a theming effect (certain corporations being better at construction or mining, for instance) players tend to specialize in what type of activities they are doing, which means it’s important to make sure you are able to match their increased efficiency.The game is very thematic. The map is an accurate topographical map of Mars with volcanoes, places for oceans, etc. Playing the cards allows you to genetic engineer plants, crash asteroids, use space mirrors etc. There’s also algae. The cards might be just changing how many cubes you have, but it’s still pretty cool.The only complaint I have is that the resource system is very cheaply done. There’s a sheet where you place cubes to keep up with your income, but they literally just lay on the sheet, there’s no holders for the cubes. Therefore, if you accidentally bump the table or someone’s hand scrapes across these, congratulations, you probably have ruined the game. My group got in the habit of periodically taking pictures of our sheets just in case.Overall, Terraforming Mars is a fantastic addition to any board gamers shelf.

Very fun, but with a steep learning curve
","

  My general impression of the game itself is overwhelmingly positive, but I have several concerns that prevent me from giving it a higher review.It took us over 4 hours to play our first game. An hour and a half of that was reading the instructions and setting up the board. The rulebook complexity is about on par with Pandemic, but Pandemic's rulebook is better organized. Our general consensus was that everything would have made more sense if it had been ordered differently. If it's not possible for rookies to learn this game from seasoned players, then I'd suggest reading the rules in the following order:1. Background2. Game overview3. Game board, tiles, and global parameters4. Player boards and markers5. Cards6. Symbols7. Setup8. Generations9. Actions10. Game end11. Game variantsOnce we got the game going, though, we had a lot of fun. We played a second time a few days later and deliberately kept the game going for over 3 hours / up to the 16th generation, when we could've ended it as early as the 10th or 11th.My biggest complaint besides the rulebook is the packaging. There isn't even a plastic tray in here like there is for Catan and many others... just the game board, the tile boards, the card decks, and plastic bags for e.v.e.r.y.t.h.i.n.g.... With so many components, the plastic bags are overwhelming. Setup and repacking both take forever. This is one game for which I will almost certainly be purchasing the Broken Token set, although I strongly believe that - for a $70 game!! - the box should have included a better organization system on its own.The quality of the box (despite lacking an organizer), board, tiles, and cards are consistent with what I would expect from a game at this price. The other materials are a different story:- The player cards are thin, and they bend or curl easily. And one bump to the table can send resource and production trackers all over the place. Maybe player cards aren't the right solution for this? Or maybe at least a matte finish would be better than glossy. Game Trayz has a neat plastic tray solution.- The player markers are identical to the ones used for Pandemic, which is okay, I guess. Personally, I think solid colors (instead of translucent) would look better on this board, since it has much finer details than the solid blues on the Pandemic board.- The resource markers are the same style as the player markers, but sized differently, and plated with a metallic coating. It's very obvious these were coated while they were still on the tree from the injection molding process, as one corner of every resource marker is bare, and it gives a distracting unfinished look to the whole lot.- The global parameter markers are bland and uninspired - just three plain white cubes. Replacing these with specific markers or tiles for the Generation counter, the O2 counter, and the Temperature counter would go a long way.Despite these concerns, I can't recommend this game enough. Wait till it's on sale (I bought mine for $39.99), and watch some videos on YouTube or Board Game Geek to help speed up the learning curve. But don't pass it up!!

  First, know that we have over 120 board games in our home and we play in a dedicated board game room with a dedicated board game table for our dedicated board game night with our dedicated board game friends. We’re quite dedicated to board games.Terraforming Mars has simple mechanics. It’s resource management, card management, and tile laying. There are a lot of options for your strategy and you never feel like someone else totally destroyed your plans by how they played their last turn. I also like the global feel of the game. If someone laid a tile or increases an indicator, it impacts everyone.This game is decidedly one of our favorites. It’s  a fun theme, easy enough to learn, and very replayable. Peopel who are not as dedicated to games as us enjoy this game too. Be aware however, it might take a while to play in the first few plays.

this game is perfect. You don't have to attack others and you ...
","

  There is a bit of a learning curve to this game since every card has it's own properties.  On the other hand, this leads to a lot of enjoyable playability since the mistakes you make in one game you can correct in a future one. And if one time you want to be cooperative and the next time cut-throat, this game is perfect.  You don't have to attack others and you can definitely win if you don't but sometimes it is just nice to get out hostilities...If you can find someone to teach you the game all the better, but you can also go online and view sample games.  No matter what you do, it will take you a while to master the game since there are so many strategies that can be played.One of the nice things about this game is that you are given five cards at the start of a turn.  You can keep them at a cost or not take them.  If a very good card comes up early you might hold on to it by paying it's price or surrender it and use the money for something else.It is always a matter of trade offs.I have played the game about a dozen times so far and keep thinking of new ways to let cards work together.  It is going to be a while before I get it all down.

Wonderful medium complexity board game with great replayability
","

  Wow--this is such a well designed game.  My husband and I are avid board game players and tend to play games that are good for two players, but have the ability to be played by a larger group (so we are ready for when friends come over).  We have played this game with two players 25+ times in the past two months and 2 times with three players--it works well for both sizes (and I imagine would work well with more and there is a solo variant as well).What we particularly like about this game is how well-balanced the different cards and mechanics have proven to be.  There are so many different ways to acquire VP points in this game that you can explore different strategies each time you play (and often are rewarded by switching strategies during each iteration of the game).  We largely play this game in the corporate era mode (a longer version of the game where you often spend more time building up resources before starting to gather VP) and it frequently takes us up to 2 hours in this version--can definitely be played faster in the baseline variant.  Before this game became our staple for the past few months we were playing a lot of Ascension and Lords of Waterdeep, so this game has a significantly longer play time than those two, but we have found the time investment to be worth it as it is more challenging in terms shifting strategies.Several other reviewers here have mentioned poor component quality.  This has not bothered me too much (although I agree that the first few times you use the player mats they can be bowed and make keeping track of your resources difficult) and after many replays everything has held up well on my copy.I would highly recommend this game to fans of strategy games that play well with two people.  Additionally, by playing this game you learn some fun facts about Mars, which has been entertaining.  Go science!

Great Engine/Combo Building Game
","

  I heard from a bunch of serious gamers that TM was one game I needed on my shelf. I saw the price drop, so I took their recommendation and bought it.Thematically, you are a corporation whose job is to Terraform Mars. On your turn will take 1 or 2 actions and this usually involves playing a card or activating an ability on one of your cards already in play. At first, your options will be pretty limited to just playing the cards from your hand, but as you buy more cards (consider them patents) you'll have more options. We probably played the first 4-5 rounds (called Generations) wrong. We took our 1 or 2 actions and then we acquired our resources. Once everyone has had a turn, you get another turn if you can take at least one action. And this process repeats until everyone passes/has no more actions they can take. Once everybody has passed, then you acquire your resources. Once we realized we were making this mistake, it sped up the gameplay, increased what we could do, and upped the enjoyment factor.To win at Terraforming Mars, you will count the points you accumulate during the game: playing certain cards, acquiring certain tags on cards, acquiring plants or animals on blue cards, having your cities touch green spaces, and your overall Terraforming Rating. I honestly did not know who was going to win the game until we counted our points at the end.While you are competing against the other players, your actions (and theirs) really don't hurt or help the other players. There was one card that allowed me to take a token from any card (we read that as anyone's card, not just mine and I we might have played that wrong). So, there are 'some' instances of your card/action directly affecting another player, but these are few and far between. There is no fighting and no one can be put out the game or go bankrupt like in Monopoly.Increase the playtime duration by 30 minutes to 1 hour on your first playthrough if everyone is new to it, but I think we got a firm grasp of the game by round 5 or 6. There are advanced rules and I would like to play those on my next playthrough.There are multiple expansions to this game, but I have not played any of them.Some people have complained about the quality of the game pieces (or lack thereof). The cubes are fine. The piece of card board to mark your resources is flimsy, and if you knock the table, your cubes (and you'll have at least 6 of them on your card at any given time) can get knocked off. I have seen a free app for iphone that is supposed to track this and you can buy some really nice wooden or plastic ones that will prevent this, but they are unnecessary in my opinion. Some people have mentioned that some of the cards look like their clip art: most of the art seems original and a minority of them seem like they came from a stock photo (there is one of a white dog I can remember that seemed out of place). To me, this did not hurt the game. There are a LOT of cards and each of them is original, no duplicates!Overall, I enjoyed the game and can see my group playing this one in the future.

Hits my table again and again... and again.
","

  I've played many euro games but this is by far my favorite. My wife and I own at least 50 board games and this has hit our table the most over the past year. Beating out other games like Gloomhaven as our number one game.The game has tremendous replay value with so many unique patents and corporate empires to play with. Each time I play I employ a new strategy I've never tried before because of the cards dealt. I'm a very large fan of Puerto Rico, it is all strategy and no luck. PR is not a very forgiving game if you make a wrong choice, so veterans of the game often reign victorious. TM on the other hand feels like a heavy strategy game that constantly gives you opportunity every turn, and yet is very forgiving to mistakes. If you choose the wrong path at the beginning, it is easy to switch up your strategy and you'll still find yourself competitive even at the end of the game.One of the most surprising aspects of this game is games are always close. Often I think I am destroying my opponents only to count our total score and find they were right behind me. I have thought I'm losing by double digits in points and in the end I'm right at the top with the leader. The games tendency to always be close results in all players feeling satisfied by their accomplishments at the end of the game. Our gaming group always leaves the table happy and wanting to play Terraforming Mars again.

Decent game, very cheap parts
","

  The game itself is decent and actually enjoyable playing by yourself, I have yet to play with my family. Now, as a simply introduction the game is an engine builder, that simply means that you start with minimal resource income. However, as the game progresses and you gain more cards or spend resources, you can increase the income you receive every turn. An example would be you start with 1 income, and towards the end of the game you may have something like 60 income per turn. Finally, in regards to the quality of the components, I really cant see a family playing the game more than a few times before resource tokens provided are broken and or very visibly damaged. I've played roughly 3 games by myself to get the grasp of it and almost every token has minor chips and or significant chunks missing. You could assume that I am a caveman with sausage fingers and throw my pieces around, but in reality I cant see myself playing any differently that you might. In essence the pieces are simply of poor quality, however the game is enjoyable so weigh the costs and benefits.

  I have owned over a thousand board games over the years (literal truth.)  This is my newest favorite.  It has the benefit of offering various resource machines to build, but also fits the theme so well that it has me watching and reading more on current Martian exploration.

As this is a beginner strategy game, I would not recommend this game for seasoned strategists, but rather for folks who are just getting into strategy gamesBuild: 9 on 10The build of the game was really good.  The quality of trains was sturdy and the look and feel of the board was professional.  I did not need a sleeve for the cards as they did not bend and were nice and flat.  They also have a nice touch and feel.  While one of my trains was damaged,  they had provided plenty of spare trains which made it worthwhile.Packaging: 10 on10The package was received on time.  The product itself comes in nice professional box and has dedicated locations to store each item from the game.  It was quite easy to unwrap the product and start using it.Overall: 9 on 10Overall, having played many many strategy games, this still ends up as one of my favorite ‘light’ strategy games.I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item. I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I can’t hold or touch the products before buying them. So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item I’m thinking about purchasing. I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others – to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). If you have found this review helpful, I’d love if you’d indicate that below.

choo choo get on board but also one quick thing about the actual board
","

  So here's the deal this game is super fun just like everybody says so don't think my less than 5 star review indicates anything but that.  We play it as a family and both the parents and the kids get really into it. High play and replay-ability, quick to learn but a LIFETIME TO MASTER and all that stuff like you'd expect based on everyone raving about it.Observations / suggestions / etc: - Requires a fairly big surface area given lots of cards and lots of pieces are part of this game - Gameplay is super fast, you can get around the horn very quickly (4 players can play in 30 seconds total if they all just draw cards), so don't think you're going to be getting up to get a drink after your turn or anything.  Or checking phones seriously just put them away.  Good to agree on a set ""break time"" or something - Total game time is also pretty fast but not silly fast.  An hour or 90 minutes or so. - If you play with people who are sneaky you should think about wearing sunglasses so they can't see where you are looking on the board because it might give away your strategy if they could tell where you are focusing - If you're playing against people who don't wear sunglasses try and watch their eyes so you can see where they are looking, it may give away their strategy and you can swoop in and take their routes and win the game that'll teach them - The spot labeled Duluth is clearly in Minneapolis/St Paul and *everyone* who you play with from Minnesota will point it out - I recommend some sort of ""card holder"" thing if you play with younger kids and/or people with smaller hands.  We have some wooden boards with slots cut in them to hold cards and they help a ton in this game (and others). I put a picture of that up.My only real critique of this game - and the reason it's 4 not 5 stars - is the board doesn't sit especially flat.  You can see in the pictures I attached.  At times you have what seems like a million little trains on the board and just having the board not sit flat makes it seem a bit cheap. This is all about MANUFACTURING quality however, not about GAMEPLAY quality.

Disappointment / Buy a different version than this one
","

  I love the game Ticket to Ride. I own the 10th-anniversary edition and the Boats and Trains edition. This 15th-anniversary edition is not nearly the quality. The only thing that denotes this as special is the sleeve that slides over the box. They have down-sized the game. The board is smaller which is ok. But, they have made all the cards Mini-Sized. They are too hard to shuffle and hold. It would have been ok to have the ticket smaller but not the playing cards. The New Millenium Monopoly had better translucent pieces than these trains.In the 10th-anniversary edition, each train is a different kind of train car. This one they are all the same train just different colors. I do not like this version.My suggestion, if you are wanting to buy this game, get an older version.

It is a favorite game now in our family
","

  Having played this game multiple times with all ages 8-65 years old, we have made a few modifications. At the beginning of the game, we deal out six train cards instead of four. We also can draw cards and play trains in a single turn. I agree with other reviews that 2-4 is the ideal number. It is a favorite game now in our family. Last January on a no school day, we had three games going and then a championship game and a consolation game. The kids, aged 8-12, only played one game but enjoyed playing and were competitive players. The championship game was game on and very competitive!

Favorite family game!
","

  We LOVE this game! At first the instructions seemed a little daunting to us, but after a quick google search we stumbled upon an extremely helpful video done by the actor, Wil Wheaton. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHmf1bau9xQ  Once we learned how to play, we were able to quickly and simply explain the rules to our 9 year old daughter in minutes. We originally bought the game for her. But to be honest, my husband and I have enjoyed playing it so much that I think we've played it 4x as much as she has. It's a very basic strategy game - Your goal is to have the most points at the end of the game. You gain points by claiming routes and completing destination tickets. We've tried playing the game with a couple of different strategies and no two games are ever really the same. It's a fantastic family game for up to 5 players, great for children and/or adults. Highly recommend it to be added to anyone's game collection.

Ticket to Ride- It has quickly become my go-to game for family game nights
","

  I'm in my 30's and have been looking for games to play while visiting my parents or with my roommate and his kids, and ""Ticket to Ride"" has quickly become a favorite.  I first heard about it online about a year and half back, on a gaming show hosted by Wil Wheaton, and immediately ordered a copy.  It's a game that's simple enough that a child can grasp it, (I'd say 10 years old would be a good starting age, though it is advertised as being for ages 8+)  but also complex enough to be entertaining for teens and adults.It's essentially a card collection game, as you try to draw matching colors in order to trade them in and build trains between cities on a map of the US.  (With each line needing a specific color and number of cards.)  In addition, each player must also complete specific routes or ""tickets"" between key cities (often at different ends of the map), and can also work on other tasks like trying to build the longest singular train path, which gives you and end-game score-boost.As I said, it's very simple to grasp.  But there's quite a bit of complexity, as most of the tasks can be completed multiple ways, and players can actively try to block one-another's routes and strategies by getting to certain areas first.  With dozens of locations on the map and numerous ""tickets"" to play, it makes each new playthrough fun and unique.  There's near-endless replay value, and with various expansions and ""sequels"" having been released, there's even more potential for players who master this original edition.Playtime usually lasts between 40-80 minutes, depending on the number of players and their experience, and it's very quickly paced once everyone gets their hands on the cards they need.The materials include a rather large gameboard (make sure you have a sizable table to play on, as it's roughly twice the size of most standard tabletop game-boards), wooden score-keeping pieces, over 100 cards and plastic trains in about a half-dozen colors.  If I were to nitpick, I would definitely say the cards are oddly small and thus can be hard to shuffle and handle- especially at the start of each game, when you'll end up spending 15 minutes just trying to mix them up as much as possible.  But it's a small price to pay for such a fun game.Overall, Ticket to Ride has quickly become a family favorite, and it is definitely one I'd highly recommend!  A 5 out of 5!

  It's rare to find a game that everyone in the family loves.  This is that game.With most games, we get one of 3 scenarios in my household.  1) my boys like it.  They're a little older and we play a lot of strategy games.  My daughter (who is the youngest) doesn't win these often and either tires of them quickly or doesn't like them at all.  2) My daughter likes it.  These tend to be games steered more towards chance where strategy is not so important.  The boys generally only tolerate these because I make them play (gotta keep it fair, you know)  Or 3) a few games are somewhere in the middle that none of us loves but none of us hates either.  The compromise game.But with Ticket to Ride, we have a real winner.  There's enough strategy in it that you can make or break your game on your own merits, but there's also enough element of chance in it (and the strategy isn't typically too deep) that younger kids will enjoy it too (as long as they're old enough to grasp the game mechanics in the first place).  Light-hearted, fairly fast-paced, and - excuse the cliche but seriously - fun for the whole family!

  This is an awesome game. If you like to spend time with your family, you've got to buy this.  Many hours of fun.  If you don' really like your family, then don't buy it.

Start with fewer people when learning how to play

  Great game...But we gave this to the kid who doesn't like to think ahead and only sees one way of doing things. Our mistake was to play the first time with 5 people. It took forever with that many people and figuring out how to play. It is not a difficult game but you do have to learn how to play it. We should have played the first time with 3 players and then I think he would have liked it. Once the game is learned it can be rather fast-paced. He has decided never to play again...but the rest of us love it and play often.

Not what we thought it would be

  I bought this from amazon during a promotional sale at a deep discount and was impressed by the glowing reviews. Our game seemed to be of good quality and had all its pieces. It was much bigger than I had anticipated and we had to play at the kitchen table rather than our usual card table. It took me several times to read the directions and figure out how to play to teach my daughter but we did manage to get a game going finally and learn how it all worked. About halfway through the game she looked at me and said, ""Can I go do something else now?"" At first I was a little hurt that she'd want to leave halfway through a game with me, but then I realized I was thinking the same thing. It just wasn't fun to us. We've decided to re-home the game and stick to chess and monopoly.

Good family game
","

  Ticket to Ride is one of those games that I've always heard about but never actually tried, so I bought it for me and my 9 year old to play. We loved the Alexa set up and guided play. The only problem is that at one point Alexa says something like ""If you need help just say Alexa.."" but her own voice triggered her and we got stuck in a loop for a few minutes. (When she says her name, just yell TICKETS or something loudly enough that it doesn't directly trigger her listening). The background train noises were pretty cool, and it was nice to not have to worry about keeping track of points. Now I wish other games also had a vocal app tie -in.The game itself was easy enough that we got right into playing (although the first time Alexa does guide you thru the rules) and I think when my husband plays with us we'll be able to just explain it to him fairly quickly. The two player variant left a lot of room for routes but you can definitely see that 3 or more players will have you thinking a little more strategically about how to chose your routes. We were able to play this game together and have a conversation, so even though the game is pretty much what you see it has pretty good replayable value since we can do it while we discuss things or talk about our day, etc.

Great game!

  We LOVE this game so much that we have purchased other versions (though they're not as good as the original IMO). It's good for a variety of age groups. There is a bit of strategy involved and it's competitive without being cutthroat.Basically you draw route cards and you complete as many as you can using the little trains (using colored train cards to complete the necessary length of track) until someone gets low on train pieces. Longer routes are worth more points and if you're lucky your routes will overlap. Your pawn moves around the perimeter of the board as you lay down trains on the tracks according to the size of track and add in all your completed route points at the end of the game (or deduct for incomplete routes). Whoever is further on the count is the winner. I'd say it takes about a half hour per game.CONSThe pieces are a bit small so if you're arthritic or VERY young, you may find it challenging. My mom has a hard time reading the city names. I would LOVE to see a deluxe version with indents in the board for the pieces to stay where you put them (Heaven forbid you bump the board), and flags for the cities so they can be read easily from all sides of the table.

Anyone simplifying house rules for players who struggle?
","

  I bought this for my dad for Christmas.  He is hard to shop for but he likes trains and both my parents likes games.  We played it this afternoon.  Some other reviewers describe getting poor quality counterfeits, but the copy I received is either real, or a very good fake, since it had all the pieces and seems solid.  It Is a fun game but I already knew that.  I hope my parents will play it again.I am already thinking up house rules to simplify it for my mom, who is an avid game player and really wants to play, but is suffering some memory loss issues.1.  I am going to suggest we let each player both pick cards AND play routes, each turn.  Having to do one or the other is a strategy element in the game, but my mom found it unintuive we had to explain it again every time it was her turn.  Memory loss has made her impatient, so she was always placing routes when a better strategist would have waited for more cards.  She's not going to learn to wait, so having everyone pick their cards and also play a route if possible, each turn, will make it fairer to her.2.  And I am going to suggest we let players pick up two cards each time regardless if they are wildcards.  This will lean it a little more to luck instead of skill because they'll get snatched up as soon as they come up, but at least we can stop reminding her that she can't have two cards if she takes the wildcard.Both of these will also move the game along more quickly, which also will make her happier.

Great game - mediocre manufacturing
","

  The game itself is great - pretty easy to learn but hard to master. There is a lot of room for developing a strategy and gaining on your family. :) A full 5 stars for the concept and rules of the game, etc. However, as many others have noted, the quality of the board, cards and train cars leaves something to be desired. For around $45, this is a fairly pricey board game but it feels like a lot of corners were cut in the design. The board does not lay flat unless you leave it out overnight with some heavy books on it before you play the next day. The cards are much too small and therefore hard to shuffle and stack. They should be normal playing card size. The train car pieces are small and lightweight and easily get knocked around the board by mistake. I'd love to see a board with some texturing that could prevent this. I'd still buy the game again because we have a lot of fun with it. My husband enjoys it as much as my 7yo. However, I probably wouldn't give it to another family because I feel like the physical game causes a lot of unnecessary frustration.  By the way, I did register my copy online and it is not counterfeit as many others have claimed their copy to be.

  It took me a little bit to learn the rules of the game, but it includes a very nice and easier to read than others instruction manual. My sister visits us every summer and normally we play cards, cribbage or euchre or something, with an occasional board game or two. This year, we mostly played this game. It is good if you are playing with 2 players or all 5 players. It can be fun to make up some of your own house rules too and change it up a bit. Every game is different but with the same goal. The games don't go on forever like in a game like Monopoly. Most games last between 1/2 to an hour. Usually we ended up playing about 2-4 times before we were done for the day. After she got home, she bought the European model for at home and when I visit. I think this is a MUST HAVE game in everyone's collection, moreso than the classics out there. I love playing this game and it is good for families. I would say kids down to about 5 or so would be able to grasp this game fine but some on the younger end might be a little bit frustrated or slow at some of the things that need to be done during the game. I also think it is funny that Duluth shows up on the map where Minneapolis and other locations similar. Just some liberties needed for pieces to fit right. I would definitely add this to your collection if you don't have it yet.

  This game is a blast.  Its repeatability is high, among games like Monopoly.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:1 - There is only 5 players maximum. The board could accomodate 1 more player. I know that does not seem like a big difference, but in the play and flow of the game, having 1 more player could make this game even tighter and more competetive, forcing players to have more strategy in picking their routes.2 - The instructons for this game are very long and repetetive, and even somewhat confusing. It all makes sense after you get through a few rounds of turns, but at first the instructions leave players looking for a simpler bullet list of ""how to"".Other than this, the game is near perfection.

","

  As a whole this is a great game.  It is very simple for new players to learn yet allows for advanced play and strategy for veteran players.  Every game is different due to the randomization of the tickets.  My 10 year old loves playing it with me.  I've taken the game to family gatherings and it is an easy to get everyone to play because it is so easy for new players to pick up yet has plenty to offer for experienced players.I was concerned ordering online and having the game delivered due to complaints of damaged boxes and the like.  I'm very protective of my stuff and want to keep it in mint condition.  My game arrived if flawless condition.  It shipped in an over-sized box with ample packaging materials.While I think the game is great there are a few minor things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.The board doesn't lay completely flat.  It appears as if the board seams are too tight preventing it from laying flat.  I'm hoping over time it will flatten out more.I may be spoiled from playing my friends 10th Anniversary Edition of Ticket To Ride but the color and ticket cards are just too small.  They are hard to hold onto and even harder to shuffle.  The 10 Anniversary Edition has full-sized playing cards which are much easier to handle.  The card storage in the box also doesn't make sense to me.  The way the plastic box insert is molded all of the colored cards can't be stacked together.  You must separate part of them and put them into the same stack with the ticket cards.  This seems like a minor thing but it would have been so simple for them to fix it by making one of the stack spots a bit deeper in the plastic insert.

  I really do not know what to think of this game.It's complicated and takes a long time to play one game. Figure it a cross between chess and monopoly.The idea is to connect railroad lines to get from one point to another. The possibilities are almost infinite, but the cards to earn certain lines are not.... frustrating.We played several games, it took the better part of a day to do so... There are a lot of details to track, things to accomplish, others to block (chess) and lots of cards and resources to track (monopoly). It requires lots of people to play. I doubt it would be fun with only two people (monopoly).I would recommend the game as a gift. To someone you really didn't like, or just want to get revenge on for that orange pumpkin cookie jar they gave you last Christmas.

  In my local homeschooling community, I have heard the name of this game come up many times. I ordered it to see what all the fuss was about. My family (ages 9 to 44) played it and loved it! There are a few different strategies you can use to beat your opponents (building the longest connected route, building routes on your ticket cards, building on longer tracks, cutting off your opponents routes, and going out before your opponents can fully implement their strategy). We are still trying to perfect our strategies and having a good time practicing them.

  Great gateway game!!  What that means is this is a great game that you can bring out that will not be overly complex and scare off casual gamers.  My wife and I love to spend time and this game allows us to be able to play and talk about the day while the kiddos are asleep.This game has been one of those games that our friends and family ask to play again.  To me if someone asks you to play a game again you should look to purchase those games because of the replay-ability maximizing your investment.2 player games allow you the ability to stay away from each other for the most part but It does extremely stressful with 4 or more players as you will have multiple people not happy you blocked their route early and they have to live with not making their routes :) (Don't let 4-5 players stop you from playing though)Great game and look for it to play with family.  And I would recommend it if you need a list of games to start your collection.  This game really can compliment other games such as Worker Placement (Carcasonne or Settlers), Deck Building (Dominion), Co-op (Anything Matt Leacock), etc.  This doesn't duplicate and load you down on any genre that you have really.Pros* Great replay-ability* Great for 2 and works with more* Great Gateway game to introduce people to board games* Easy enough to talk and play* People ask to play after the first game :)Cons* Warning if you don't like stressful with 4 or more players (if you like stressful GAME ON!)...(Don't let 4-5 players stop you from playing though)

  Very fun game.  Not quick!  Don't get me wrong, it's nothing like Risk!  If everyone knows how to play and you rush them all (next person starts their turn while previous person is still laying their trains down on the board, etc) and you go super quickly you can play a game in around 30 minutes.  A leisurely pace takes 45 to an hour, depending on how much explaining you need to do or if you do a practice round and on how many players are participating.Our 5 year old even loves it!  He's getting the hang of it and only needs minimal help.  Our teenagers and on down also love it, as do we, the parents.  For some reason it's extremely satisfying to complete your routes!!

AWESOME game, awful sized cards
","

  We LOVE this game! We also own the European version but save that for more intense game nights. This is my second time purchasing this version as I left my parents with my original game when I moved out. My only complaint is PLEASE, make the cards bigger! This little ones are VERY difficult to hold and even worse to shuffle! It's almost impossible to shuffle them without bending them. You gave the European version full playing sized cards, I don't understand why you can't update the American one with that size too.

The original game that has become a revolution in board games.
","

  In our house, it's been decided that Europe is the premiere edition, given that it is the most forgiving of the versions and easiest to learn map.  That said, the original American map of T2R is a fine map for players that allows competitive strategy for route completion, tense moments where ""hey, you took my route!"" and chances to chastice your family or friends over a silly game.  Fun times, and games usually last 40m to an hour.  There's a reason why this was the #1 game since 2005.

Engaging game with solid replayability
","

  I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes boardgames. After we played this a few times, I also got pretty into the gameplay and purchased the euorpe version for myself. Overall, the game is fast paced and is mostly driven by strategy and a bit of luck associated with drawing train cards.Pros- from my understanding this is the orginial ticket to Ride game with the basic gameplay rules and mechanics. The us cities are spread across the map, making it easier to read and follow for New comers.- there are a blend of long and short routes that ensures a wide variety of strategies at play to successfully complete the destination tickets- the board itself is sturdy and I am not too worried about bending the cardboardCons- the train and destination cards are small compared to the ones that are provided in the Europe iteratuon. Tickets are small enough to make it a bit difficult to hold onto.- once you play the expansion maps with the addition mechanics of tunnels, ferries and so forth the basic USA map included in this package can feel a bit too simple. I suggest starting with this USA version, before jumping onto the newer Europe based map collections

Fun and challenging game.
","

  I had played this game before buying it. My suggestion would be to watch a You Tube video on how to play. Makes it much simpler to understand vs reading rules. It is a great, while certainly intense, game to play. I also had purchased the 1910 expansion pack. It seems wasteful, but the cards that the game comes with are obsolete if one has the 1910 expansion pack. The expansion pack makes the game better. The expansion pack cards are larger which makes them easier to manage and of course there are more of them. I understand that the manufacturer is making more money by selling an expansion pack. But the more eco and customer friendly would be to simply have the cards in the expansion pack as part of the original game.

Favorite family game!
","

  We love this game! Our kids (12 & 8) love this game! We love that our kids love this game! :)If you've never played, you are building railroads that connect cities. You are given cards that tell you what these connections have to be, and you gain points for completing them. If you don't finish in time, you lose the points.You build these tracks by collecting color cards that coordinate to paths on the board.It's not an overly competitive game while you play it... Some scores are kept during the game, but the major chunk of your points aren't revealed until the end. So other than getting annoyed when someone takes the line you've been trying to get, you are more concerned about your own play instead of what others are doing. This is good for our 8 year old who tends to get frustrated when he knows he's losing at a game.We love games... Have over 100 games at our house... And this is in the top 5 of our favorites! I'd highly recommend it to anyone that likes ""strategy with a bit of luck"" kind if games.

Fun game for older kids and adults
","

  This is a fun game to play. It takes a little while to get the hang of it, but there's a great app of the game and playing on that made transitioning into the board game version a breeze. There are a few things that I think people should know when deciding to buy this game:1. You will not learn geography from it. It has seemingly randomly selected cities, no state lines, and not all the cities are on the board quite where they should be. It is a ""worker placement"" strategy game, not a geography game.2. You really need to buy yourself some good card holders. You will end up with a hand of dozens of cards, which you will want to keep fairly organized, and visible to you while hidden from others. A good card holder with 3-4 layers of slots on each holder has been indispensable. I have a hard time finding them on Amazon, but found them on etsy fairly easily.3. This is not for small children. If someone bumps the board, the game is pretty much over because those trains skitter everywhere.

  Games are fun for bonding. Playing is not very clear and it seemed a bit slow.Here are three rules we changed to move things along a bit:1) We can do all the things listed for a move in one move: Pick two routes, pick three cards, lay as many trains as we have cards to buy them.2) We can pick three train cards, rather than just two, per move.3) We can trade train cards on any turn with any player who wants to trade.4) We can lay down trains on a route before we have it, in anticipation.5) We can begin laying trains from both directions simultaneously on a route.6) There are five train cards face-up, rather than four.With these six rule changes it is the funnest game we are playing.

  If you are looking for a game the whole family will love, get this game.It is colorful, well built and fun.  My son loves maps and trains, so this was a win-win.  You draw out destinations your trains need to go and you build tracks between here and there.  Other train makers can block your path on the way to their destinations and you may have to find another route.  We played on Christmas day and we had a great time.  This is a well made game and should be in every game-loving family.  We are considering purchasing the other versions as well.  Good times for all.Update:  Just have to say this really is a great game.  We play it all of the time.  Buy this game!

  We play a lot of games with our friends but they are I guess what you would call party games. Games like That's What She Said, Apples to Apples, The meme game. A lot of giving your cards to the reader and hoping your card gets picked. They are fun but we wanted something more, and this was just the ticket!The game was easy to learn and a lot of fun to play.Being able to play along with Alexa was a great bonus. She walked us through the game since it was our first time. She can play as another player. I think you can even play alone against her. You can also just use her to keep track of the game and keep score. There are train sound effects and old timey music as background music. It was fun, and it actually worked.

  My husband and I were introduced to this game by friends and then he HAD to have it. We took it on vacation with my family and I think there were at least 3 games a day among various groups of people. Needless to say, it has become a go-to game when we are together with friends or family. You can play with just 2 people but I find that it is much more enjoyable and interesting with at least 4. We aren't into gaming at all but really enjoy the strategy that goes into this game and that you can complete the game in a reasonable time frame.The board is a big map with destination cities. Each player has destination cards and the goal is to get from one destination to another by linking train pieces across the map. You connect city to city by collecting and playing cards of different colors. Earn points by connecting cities - the longer the distance, the more points. Once a destination route is complete, you also earn points for that card. A shorter distance (New York to Chicago) is worth less than longer distances (New York to LA). Of course there are different rules for collecting and using cards, how to score points, etc. that you can read into deeper once you purchase.

  We bought Ticket to Ride Europe after reading a lot of reviews and then bought this one. We enjoyed playing TTR Europe because it has tunnel and ferry routes that add more elements/dimensions  to the  game. The U.S.A map feels lackluster compared to the Europe map because all you do is just use connect point A to point B using rail routes. This is the only reason why I have deducted a star.

Extremely cheap “deluxe” edition

  This was by no means a deluxe edition.  It is very cheaply made with an awkward method of connecting the two halves of the board.  The two halves were not even.  It‘s not a turntable like previous deluxe scrabble editions - the two halves of the board have wheels, instead.  Not a dealbreaker, but not smooth rotation.  The pieces were highly irregular as well, all different shapes and sizes, some patterns not printed in the center, and one piece was just straight-up broken.  Even the manual was poorly formatted and confusing.  I would feel slightly ripped off at paying $20 for this cheap plastic garbage, much less $40!  From what i can tell, all the Scrabble editions made by “Winning Solutions”, “Winning Moves” and “WS Games” are all very cheaply made and overpriced.

  This is VERY poor quality - so bad that players can't really enjoy the game.  By no definition is this ""Deluxe"".  This is nothing like the classic products made and sold by Hasbro (or whatever company had it some years ago).  The price is completely unjustifiable.  The materials are all very cheap, and feel, sound and play that way.  Again, players just can't really enjoy the game, because of the distractions attributable to poor quality (such as the board always coming apart).Older versions are available and better, even if used.  You might find them on Amazon, or you can find them on other large auction sites.  If you require a new version, do your research and try to get a look at an opened product before you buy, even in a retail store.  There are older wooden versions, and other better-made plastic and cardboard versions.  If you want the true deluxe, you can find the 'Scrabble Deluxe Classic [or Wooden] Edition' here on Amazon and elsewhere.  It's much more expensive, but the quality is there.  If you want to spend about the same as this product costs, you'd do better to find a slightly used older version, including with wooden turntables and wooden trays and pieces, on an auction site (or maybe on Amazon).

   Pros: Not being on a lazy susan (turning table) but instead having angled wheels makes the game board lower to the table which I like. The raised borders work well and the letter pieces stay in place. The way the board hooks together in the center is easy.Cons: pressing the middle of the board makes it cave in a little. The fact it doesn’t snap together but lay in place is neither a good or bad design.  The cardboard box is the carrying case. Not a lasting design and kinda cheap. The wooden pieces aren’t all printed center and that bothers some people. I personally don’t care.Overall: I think it’s good for the price but not great.

  I personally never played Scrabble but have heard and seen it plenty of times. Played it with the family one day and less than a week later we have it ourselves and enjoy it everytime.Product is great and the box acts as a case to carry it where you need to. Wooden pieces feels light and sorta cheap but we are not that picky about it. Set up is truly quick and smooth. Simply pull the small hinges out from one side of the board and connect the other. It would be nice to have some type of lock with it so you wouldn’t have to keep it on a flat surface. We played on carpet and it still spun fine, just remember that my carpet/floor may be more leveled than your own. It did separate a few times from one hinge. Once you finish spinning the board just reconnect and continue. If we were on a flat surface then this wouldn’t be an issue. Board grids fit each piece slightly loose but I expect it to be like this.Overall, it’s worth the buy. Would recommend this to anyone. Price could be another factor but I feel this will last a very long time if taken cared of. Why the 4 stars? Cause if Hasbro could add locking hinges so it prevents or lessen the chances of separating during the game then it would be a well deserved 5 stars.

  Bought this on sale, would not have been happy at full price, but I’m fine with it on sale.As others have noted, the tiles are printed unevenly (how difficult could that be?), and the board sometimes comes apart during play if people aren’t gentle turning it - especially on my grooved wooden table. It’s hollow plastic so also rattley on such surfaces.What annoys me the most, however, is that Hasbro refuses to sell a *circular* game board like they use in tournaments, which is ideal. With a rotating square board (or worse, rectangular like this one, for reasons I don’t understand), people tend to move their tiles too close during play and they have to move them again for rotation.I would pay good money for one of those tournament boards, although I do understand they are impractical to store for most consumers.

  The letter tiles are made of wood; however, the tile holders are light, bendable plastic. These cheap-o tile holders are not depicted on the cover of the box which I later deemed deceptive.  Your letters can easily be knocked off the plastic rack due to the lack of weight.  There goes your game plan. For the money, I think the tile holders should be made out of wood as they used to be and as you might expect.  I would keep the game if wooden tile holder replacements were provided and I were allowed to simply throw the nasty plastic ones away without having to go to the PO to return them during this pandemic.

Doing so would have spared me considerable disappointment when I opened the Deluxe Scrabble and found just about the cheapest piece of manufacturing I have ever seen--especially at the price point. The tiles are featherweight, for starters, and drop off the table unnoticed (I can so attest). The red plastic trays are appalling. The font used on the design of the board looks like it's designed for the preteens, at best. And, finally, while it's true that the board does turn, it involves both hands to send on to the partner without clattering.

Decent game, poor storage organization
","

  This game makes for a nice change from regular Monopoly with the game being both team-based and focused on territorial control over pure wealth.Players form even teams and go around the board claiming free tiles, stealing them from other players, or locking them down by cementing control. Team members share money and properties. The game ends once all properties have been claimed and one team has the majority.The game itself goes pretty quickly with properties bouncing back and forth and having spaces that take a player to the nearest unclaimed spot. As players share resources, discussing strategy is important as to stop overextension (as running out of money can start a brutal chain reaction). Out first game stayed rather even to the end, with it ending with a score of 9-7, a llama victory.Where the game really fails is organization. The components include character pieces, dice, a property deck, 2 chance decks, a set of control tokens for each team, and some money (in two denominations, $100 and $500). To hold all this, you're given a basic bankers try for the standard monopoly game. This means besides the money, which only needs two of the slots, nothing fits right. And to further top it off, you can't keep it in the tray as the box is too short to allow the cards to remain upright in the slots, forcing a person to either throw everything together (either in the tray or loose in the box) or have a box that is unable to be closed all the way.

  This is a really fun game. I'd say it's best for ages 7+ The were a few things that weren't explained well in the rules, but we were able to decide the rules ourselves and move on with the game.  Compared to original monopoly, game play is faster and more competitive, players are sorted into teams, and there were lots of laughs as chance cards include fun ways to get ahead or bring the opposing team down. We found that if teams aren't even there's a slight advantage to the team with fewer players, as their tokens will pass Go more frequently. I think next time we will modify by using the same number of game pieces per team and having the odd person out choose between the teammates tokens on their turn. Overall we enjoyed the game a lot and will definitely play often.

  It’s kind of a weird version of monopoly. I mean, I’m not sure what I expected since it’s llamas vs unicorns. My daughter wanted it for Christmas so I (I mean Santa) got it for her. The game goes fast so I don’t feel like I have to pull my hair out trying to finish the game.The game ends when all the “properties” are bought. But the properties are properties like the original version, they are traits. Traits like “Coolest Room Decor” or “Most likely to Save the Day”. So you can “buy” and collect traits, but that also means you can take traits from other players. Each trait switches hands super fast. At first I didn’t like it because I kept thinking of them like properties from the original monopoly. But you just have to think of them as traits because that’s what they are. Think of them as the “Most likely to ...” from the high school year book. If you aren’t popular one week you’re not cool anymore and the next person gets the glory.

I like how it is simplified so children can be the banker and still keep things moving at a decent pace. Lots of opportunities to incorporate math and reading into play.

  We're all about the family games in our household, this one was added at Christmas for our 10 yr old children. The game play itself has some of the traditional Monopoly game play (chance, free parking, pass go, go to jail, etc) outside of that the game play is very different than the original, and much lighter (good for younger kids). The only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars is due to some of the rules not being clear (for example, one of the chance cards lets you move any player from the other team to the space you're on and they must follow the rules of that space... but it doesn't say what that looks like for Jail, if you're in jail and call someone to that place are they just visiting or do they go to jail with you?) Just a few little things like that - overall though, we had a lot of fun playing this light game as a family.

  Loved this game! It's a simplified version of Monopoly, but not so simple that we (age 44 & 50) didn't enjoy it.  Note: the unicorns and llamas play in teams,  so it's a good version for 2 people. Or 4 or 6, but 3 or 5 people would be unbalanced teams.

  We have played on original Monopoly board with my granddaughter since she was 5. Of Course, relaxing the rules. She loves this Unicorns and Llamas game. We think Monopoly helps build strategy. And really like that she isn't in front of the TV

  This version is amazing. It’s a great bridge between Monopoly Jr., and regular Monopoly. It’s engaging AND doesn’t last forever! Plus who doesn’t love a little llama/ unicorn competition? Very cute family game.

  I am a die hard classic Monopoly player, so I was a bit hesitant to purchase the Ultimate. It is one of the best purchases I have made for my family. We have played this almost every night since we got it a week or so ago. We love it!! Only wish more players could play at one time but other than that it's amazing!! The speed of this game gives you a chance to play multiple rounds. It's fast, fun and a nice change from the classic. Never thought I would ever say that!! Thanks for making our vacation that much more fun!!!

  This game is so much fun. It is shorter than the original Monopoly and longer than Monopoly Jr. It had its own similarities to both the original and junior versions but with its own twist, too. You play as teams. Each team can be made up of only one person. We usually have the odd man out be the banker.

  We are highly disappointed in this product. This was delivered Sunday, and we took turns playing it Monday and Tuesday evenings. This pic was just taken this morning, Wednesday, after only 2 nights of use. It is very cheaply made and scuffed up so badly that the little pucks do not glide smoothly anymore and kind of defeats the purpose of the game.

  This FULL price game arrived in the bare box (not a shipping box) unsealed with the word ""DEMO"" written on both sides using a sharpie.

Ended up giving it away and building a much better version using a tray, checkers and a smattering of imagination.

  The first order of this the item had a defect. The bottom board that is glued to the border had one corner that was slanted down. So when you try to line up the discs, the disc would go under the rope rather then in front of it.I wasn't able to press the bottom board up to be flush with the border, since the glue was blocking it from being flush.I do like the game and a good alternative to playing video games.

  I had loved this game my friend had for her kid's so I bought it for mine. The new one didn't work like her older version. Instead of wooden disks with a star on them we got slick, black hockey pucks. They don't slide the same! Maybe the elastic is placed different too but the black pucks fly all over the place and don't slide along the board like the wooden disk did. It makes the game frustrating instead of fun. So sad!

  I love the idea of this game., it’s super fun for kids and adults alike. The game board isn’t very thick, though it’s sturdy enough. It is smaller than I thought it would be. The elastic bands that you use to sling the puck aren’t as tight as they should be, making the shot fairly weak, but if you hold the slack on one side it works well. Overall we’ve had a ton of fun with the game, but I wish it was more nicely made.

  To start, my girlfriend and I were excited to get this game and play. Unfortunately the craftsmanship of this item is lacking. One side gets a very unfair advantage as the other side was not put together flat making the pucks slide under the bungie. It is a fun game, but the craftsmanship can be better.

  This game is a real winner.  It's so simple you can't believe you didn't think it up!  Of course, it's ridiculously expensive for what it is, but there's no denying that it's fun.  Strangely addictive.  It can be pretty competitive too, but it's fast moving, so each game is quickly over, and the losing player is ready to try to win the next one.  Probably very good to help develop manual dexterity for the 5 to 7 year old child.  It's also entertaining for one player to play alone (is that called ""practicing""?)  The adult kids in their 40's seemed to have just as much fun with it as the grandkids did!

More Like a Distant Cousin of the Original Game But Still Fun
","

  Overall my family loved this game, but there are some cons in addition to pros.First, if you're looking for the old-fashioned traditional game of life, this isn't it. Not even close. It's more like a distant cousin than a twin. However, with that being said, it is much easier to play and when your kids are insisting on game night and all you want to do is curl up with a book it is so much easier to use the ATM type money counter that comes with the game than handing out actually fake money for your kids to lose and your vacuum to suck up at a later date.The biggest drawback is that only 4 people can play at a time. I have six kids. Fortunately two of them are three and under and are happy to play ""teams"" with some of the other kids.Bottom line, if you're looking for the game you loved as a child this isn't it. If you're looking for something new and amusing, this is definitely worth the money.

Twice as complicated and half as fun as the original

  This isn't just an electronic version of the same ""Life"" game from years ago.  In addition to making it electronic the game itself is different, but not necessarily better (no stock, auto insurance or life insurance to buy for example, and no wedding gifts or baby gifts etc).Every player gets a card and one calculator-type device gets passed around.  You put your card in it and record whatever money you received or paid during a turn. The device tallies all the money and tells you who won. If you prefer the original ""Life"" game but not the hassle of dealing with paper money on every turn just give every player a calculator and let them tally their individual money totals on their own devices. Then you don't have to pass around one device, you don't have any cards to keep track of, and you can play the original game but ""electronically.""

  We wanted a new Life game because our old one's spinner was terrible.  This one has a FANTASTIC spinner that can't jam, and the new electronic banking is really easy and fun to use.  We were playing the original version once a week so I feel like I can speak from authority here - this one is loads better.  It's really well-designed.Top tip - have the banker hold onto all the credit cards.  It makes no sense to keep giving them back to each player at the end of every turn.It's a really fantastic way to update a game and they've changed so much, making it easy to play and lots of fun.

Fun and laughs for the whole family

  Our family has been playing a much older version of Life for the last few years, so we were looking for an updated game. This was such a step up! We received it super fast (thank you Amazon prime!!), and played it the evening we received it. Our kids are 11 and 13 and they had lots of fun. This version has cards and a card reader instead of paper cash, so my daughter loved being the “banker” adding and subtracting cash from everyone’s cards. There is so much interactive opportunities with the “action” cards, which made the game so much more fun. Some of them have you compare dance moves, try to make each other laugh, list your dream vacation and so much more. This is a longer game- it took us almost an hour to play it, but was full of laughter the entire time. I highly recommend this as a fun family game!

Didn't think I would like it, but really enjoyed it

  I tend not to like remakes of classic games. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, per his request. I really didn't think I would like the game. I was pleasantly surprised. We ended up playing it several times and we plan to play it next time we visit. The electronic counter was accurate and the addition of different career options and different housing options was fun. I still won't give up my classic game, but I will certainly play this version again. We could use more babies as we were overloading our cars :)

Still a great game!
","

  I wasn’t sure if I would like this version. We got it due to the banking aspect and my daughter was excited to be the banker and use the cards. The bank cards actually work well, easier than I thought it would be. One change I wasn’t sure about was the fact that the board isn’t the same as before. Now instead of landing on something and it’s always the same there are cards to draw which can change up the game. I am very pleased with this version.

  Great family game.  It allows you to address some crazy questions in a fun way with kids, tweens.  It does teach them math and think about what they want to their money on.  However, get ready for people to be upset.  Fun for family gatherings, or quality time together.

Great Fun and Easy to Learn
","

  Much like the classic Game of Life, the object of the game is to collect the most money, property, and overall value by the end of the game.  It is very straightforward and super easy to learn.  The electronic banking makes things go a lot more smoothly and eases up that aspect of the game in comparison to the older versions which use fake dollar bills and can get a bit overwhelming.The game is fun for those young and old and easy to understand.  The only downside that I have against it is that it is a bit TOO straightforward and simplistic.  There really isn't much strategy involved at all, more luck.  It is very a much a game where you take your turn, move your piece, do your part, and repeat.Because of the simplicity and ease of learning, I would say that this game is great for a family game night.

  This is by far my favorite childhood board game.  I love the Electronic Banking part, it makes it much harder for people to cheat and keeps the game under control in that regard.  Life is a fun simulated life board game requiring you and your opponents to got through the many different stages of life including going to school, getting married, finding a job, having children, and retiring.  Many obstacle pop up through the game to give you some challanges.  Still one of favorite board games!

Worth to pay for the banking system

  We are a bit worried about the banking system. My son recently started learning money and calculations. Should we go with the original version (paper money) or this version??  We are so glad that we got this. This device is very easy to use and even 7 year old can become ""a banker"" on this game.  The game does not take too long so both parents and kids can have a stress-free wonderful time together.

  This version is way better than the original. The original you had to play with dollar bills which take forever to organize, but now all you have to do is type in the number and it's added or subtracted from you card! Also all the dollar bills get folded and wrinkled every time you put them away. Also it is easy to learn and easy to use. Not to mention that it comes fast and in much better quality than the original life game. This game is definitely 5 stars and I recommend it to everybody on Earth!!!! (P.S. what a cheap price!)

  I bought this game for nostalgic purposes plus I was curious about the electronic banking.  After a couple games it became very easy to use.  The gameboard is smaller and redesigned and gameplay has been changed as well.  You still have the same styles game pieces and the spinner but none of the other pieces attached to the game board from previous versions.  At least you don't have to keep up with the paper money which is a plus in my opinion.  I still have fun playing this game with family and friends so I believe it's well worth the price.

  So this connect 4 is your standard connect 4. It’s not the strongest model but it gets the job done. Coming out off the box it’s 4 pieces the slide that holds or drops the chips which stays on after that and the 2 legs. To store it in the box you have to take the 2 legs off. So each time you play you need to put on the legs but it doesn’t take more than 15 seconds. Even my 3 year old nephew can do it on his own.

  Connect Four is a winner for the very young, the little bit older, and the lot older (yes, the grownups).  The really small ones have fun dropping the colored discs into patterns and then releasing them from the bottom.  Fun.  A little older kids will be getting the idea of putting four discs in a row while picking up a bit of basic math.  Some fun and some learning at that age. The grownups should enjoy the game as they attempt to connect four in a row before their opponent does so. Setup is pretty quick. Slip on the two legs and the game is set to go. If you found this review helpful, please click the 'Helpful' button below. Thank you!

  Connect Four is a family fun game from my childhood. This game is built with a bit better construction than the game of my youth although played just the same. My 6 yr old twins and 10 yr old grandkids all enjoy competing in this game for bragging rights of who is the most clever for the day.It stores easily in its game box and is set up quickly for play. Connect Four has been a staple in my game closet for 30 plus years. I purchased this to replace my love-worn game from the early 80’s. I hope this review is helpful in convincing you that this is 10$ well spent for decades of family fun. It’s a two-player game, but we play it tournament style so all can play when more than 2 want to compete. If you don’t lose the checkers... you’ll love this game still in 2050!

My 3 yo likes to mess about with it, even if he doesn't really get the concept. My 5 year old loves it. I had to hide the blue pieces though because I have no idea what they do.

  I played this game as a kid and my toddler just recently broke one of the arms on my game from when I was little. I bought this to replace my 80s version. It is not sturdy and definitely will not hold up to rough play at all. I am keeping it until she is a bit older and will see how it fairs.

  Connect 4 was always a favorite game of mine as a child, and I was very excited to play it again. It's a fair price for a fun and easy to learn with great play-ability. The plastic also seems to be made well: the board and stands fit snugly with little play, and the pieces themselves are nice.All in all, I highly recommend it to anyone who liked connect 4 growing up, or have children in their lives who enjoy some competition and using their noggins!-Joe

  I guess our expectations were a lot higher than they should have been. Saw the box and it was the same box as when we were kids except now it is so cheap. The board sits flat on the table so marbles will just roll off all the time. The board is made out of cardboard that is thinner than a cereal box and it is folded into quarters with a slit down half of it to fold better. This allows for the board to spread when trying to play allowing marbles to go all over the place.Spend the extra money and get a better version, not even worth attempting on this one.

  Besides being cheap and flimsy as other people have said (and the pieces are tiny), more importantly, THE BOARD IS DESIGNED INCORRECTLY; it shows incorrect Safety/Home zones -- and they're colored, so there's no mistaking that.Here's a link for the original board: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00134MJWE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1. I grew up with this very same board, which is great. LOOK AT THE IMAGE. The picture shows the yellow pieces in the Start zone. There's one yellow piece in the Safety zone, which is to the left of -- and AFTER -- the Start zone. That's the way the game's played!This game presumably has you only go three quarters of the way around the board, because the Safety/Home zone is BEFORE the Start zone.If you can afford it, spend the extra $14 on the REAL game. and disregard this one. You can always keep your eyes on the lookout for a used board....

They measure 1.72"" x .86"" x .23""  Good dominos - great for the price
","

  Actual dimensions are 1.72"" x .86"" x .23"", which is very slightly below (about 1/32 of an inch smaller) than1 3/4 x 7/8 x 1/4.  These are the only wooden dominos I've seen except for a set my parents have had since the 1970s.  Comparing these to those, the '70s set seem a little bit better, as my parents' are made from harder and heavier wood (almost feel like metal), with more defined engraving on both the front and back, and more clearly painted dots.  This Pressman set is more what I would expect a wooden domino to look like if I had never seen ""really good ones"" before.  And both sets are about the same size, which puts them in a tie for the smallest dominos I've ever used.  And if you want lightweight, these are very light.  The cardboard box is oversized (4"" x 6"" x 1 5/8"") - the dominos just rattle around in it loosely, which detracts from them being well suited for traveling.  You could pack the dominos neatly stacked into a box that is 3 1/2"" x 1 3/4"" x 1 1/4"".  If you made a box like that, this would be an awesome travel set or even a pocket-sized set, which is what I intend to do.  They're nice.  And they are consistent enough that I don't expect to be able to recognize specific dominos from the back unless I were to specifically try to learn that.  I feel nostalgic about them already and am very happy I bought them.

JUNK... Woodgrain Clings & Makes This Game Impossible

  The traditional pickup sticks from when I was a child were lightweight, thin, perfectly rounded, perfectly pointed plastic that was really fun to play because you could actually pick up the sticks without others moving. These “new and improved”, ahem, wooden sticks just simply don’t work. Regardless of how well-sanded and smooth they are, it is nearly impossible to pick any up without moving others because woodgrain clings to woodgrain.

The pieces are cheap plastic, but will easily serve their purpose. The board however leaves something to be desired. It is so thin, that I expect it to be torn after a very short period of time. The board appears to be thinner than standard poster board. Instruction page that comes with the game is fairly acceptable except for the backgammon instructions which are pretty vague. With all of this said, I still feel it will still work for teaching my children how to play all three games, and we will purchase another more durable and expensive set as the get older and more responsible.

  I was in NYC recently and visited a Greenwich Village boutique that had a wonderful wall tiled in dominoes. I was completely taken with the look, and decided then and there that I would do the same when I returned home to Tucson. After some experimentation, I chose black dominoes with white dots and began searching for the right ones for my project. To tile the backsplash area of my kitchen, I wanted to use double-nine dominoes for the variety it would produce in the pattern overall. When I began shopping around, I quickly discovered that many of the cheaper imports have no quality control and half the dominoes in any box were unusable, either because they were chipped or because of overprinting. I realized I should just head to Amazon, and found these Pressman dominoes which are absolutely fabulous. They are each the exact same size, and not a single one was overprinted in all the boxes I ordered! While I realize this may not be a traditional use for these game tiles, I couldn't be happier with the results!

  As a child pressman checker/chess/backgammon boards were all over.  They were good little starter sets and were made just as well as other kids games.  Alas this is no longer the case.  Here are my problems with it:- The box it comes in is to thin and it has those cardboard sharp edges.- The game board is way thinner than the old ones and seems like slightly thicker than poster board (like another reviewer said).  I looks like they printed a sheet with the squares on it and then glued it to the cardboard. Cheap, cheap.- The checkers are cheaper plastic and not as substantial.  They are easily knocked around.- The Chess pieces were ok and again not substantial so easily knocked over.  My set was incomplete. I was missing a black knight and had an extra bishop.- The board is not slippery so the pieces do not slide nicely.- The board and pieces are made in China.  Not that China makes all bad things, but it appears they bid this out to the Cheapest bidder and it shows.I normal do not write a lot of reviews, but if you are like me and remember the original pressman boards this will disappoint.Hope this helps

Very Flimsy Board
","

  My 9-year-old could not move without knocking other marbles over most of the time. The board was too flimsy for his spazzed out hands. While I never knocked any marbles loose, my 13-year occasionally did as well. Unless you have really steady hands, the marbles will roll when you move. It makes it hard to play on this board. Because he moved them almost every turn, I recycled the board after one game making the board a waste of money. As the marbles have some value, I did not rate this 1-star. These are not high quality marbles as expected given the price, so you'd be better off purchasing marbles separately and trying to get a better deal if you are only purchasing this for the marbles. If you are purchasing for the board, good luck. You're going to need it.

A Fun Game
","

  A fun game for when the grandkids visit.  They always ask to play a game of pick up sticks when they come.  I feel it builds dexterity, eye/hand coordination and concentration skills.  I like the sturdy storage container it comes with.  A hit all around, and I'm hoping it helps wean my grandson from his video game addiction!

Good for my purposes
","

  I purchased these dominoes as a prop.  For my purposes they will work.  I noticed several negative reviews which did make me hesitant to buy, but I decided that for $3 it was worth the risk.  Whether you want to buy these will depend on what you want to use them for.Details:Size: Quite small, ~1.5"" x 1"" (they are slightly larger than this on both sides, but I don't remember the exact quarter/eighth amounts)Color: for all reasonable purposes, black. This is all right for me, though I would have preferred if the dominoes were the color pictured.Material: It might be wood? through the black paint/stain you can see what looks like wood grain, but they don't Feel like wood. Maybe that is just due to the paint (or what ever they used)?Quality: despite being small not quite as I pictured them these feel like they will be sturdy dominoes. I set them up and they all balanced fine and made a typical domino chain. They do have a quieter sound when falling, which is nice.Back: The back does have the pressman logo on it, so if you want a blank back these aren't for you.Overall: I like them.  They aren't as perfect as I would like, but they are $3.  If I wanted super nice ones I would have gone for the other wooden domino set that costs $30. I posted some pictures so you can get a better idea of what these dominoes are like.

  Marbled don't mach the colors on the board. The board will not lay flay no matter what you do.The worst thing is the marbles sit so high up, the slightly bump sends everything rolling like Hungry Hipos, ruining the game. After 5 tries we gave up.

  Very disappointed.  Poor quality, poorly constructed, too light. Can't even stand them up to make those domino's mazes as they are too light and poorly cut.

Uneven board

  I love Chinese Checkers, but this specific set is awful. The board is foldable which means that one of the triangles is cut in half thereby making the board uneven. It is very easy to knock the balls off in the middle of the game. I would not recommend it.

  Somehow I thought there'd be a third set of pieces for the backgammon board. It indicates the checkers pieces are for that, too. I suppose it does nicely about resourcefulness. Smaller and separate pieces would have suited me personally though since we have a different, little board collecting dust. Well, you win some...The chess pieces aren't too bad. A bit on the light plasticy side, functional though and are sized pretty well. They'll probably fall over if you're trying to play in a moving vehicle. Yet for a table game that you simply want to play or teach chess with and aren't worried about ""quality,"" this is for you. Also comes with checkers that do stack (woohoo!) and a pair of dice, plus a list of other games you could try with these pieces. For roughly ten dollars on technically three games to start, I'd say this is a nice deal.The board is durable so it is flimsy, but it's not completely flat either. Cosmetically, a whole corner had a line of white that looked like the paint was scraped off. I'll upload a picture when I get around to it.To recap, a perfectly fuctional chess, checkers and backgammon set. I like the color scheme. On the plus side of being cheap, you could play with this until your pocket is ready for a more 'solid' set.Can't complain. Nothing missing or broken on arrival.[edit 7/14/15 -- Cat keeps knocking down the game pieces when we leave it on the table. So we know now he jumps up there regularly during the night.  Hey, kitty, share your strategy with one of us.

Great Starter Game
","

  My wife and I are bored and, having watched Grantchester on PBS, we decided to try to learn Backgammon.  We bought this economical set to see if (a) we can learn the game, and (b) we like playing Backgammon.  This is the perfect set for that, plus it offers chess and checkers.  This allows us to decide without spending a lot of money.  If we like Backgammon, we will buy a more expensive set.  Again, this set is a perfect set for those who want to learn the game and play chess and/or checkers.

  Not worth a penny! You'd be better off printing your own Pahrcheesi board at home. This board is thin as card stock. No matter what you do you will not be able to have the board lay flat.

","

  This is meant to be a cheap chess set.  It is definitely made of cheap materials, which is totally expected.  I'm rating it low because something cheap should still be functional.  I ordered eight of these boards to use with students.  The boards all came warped.  They are so bent that they don't function effectively.  We attempted to bend them into a workable flatness, but are not having any luck.I gave it a two star because the pieces are acceptable, and the board does fold down and fit into a gallon bag.  This is a great way to store a high number of chess sets.  That said, I'm really hoping that the boards flatten out over time

  I get that it is cheap, I just had no idea how cheap the quality would be. I was at least expecting normal game-board quality out of the board itself. No luck there, it is just thick tag board. The chess pieces are small and hollow with no decent weighting to them and they have open bottoms. Returning it to buy a better quality set. I would pass unless you absolutely want the cheapest set available. If I saw this on a store shelf, I would have known immediately by the weight and cheap box it came in that it would be an absolute bust.

  I bought this to use a cheap checkers/chess set to use with a kid I do autism therapy with. Obviously given the price this is a pretty bare-bones set (hollow plastic pieces, thin cardboard, etc.), but it gets the job done. The kid and I managed not to damage the board or pieces (and had fun!) so it'll probably work fine for you if you just need something cheap. Unlike other cheapo sets, this one is actually about the size of a normal checkers/chessboard. Great for broke public school teachers or people without the highest expectations.

Nothing else really like it available right now and it’s a super good quality plastic that comes with the 5-6 player expansion component!!Set up is literally 5 seconds and it solves all the problems listed above that come up when playing catan.You can pick up the whole board from a table and play on the ground if you wanted to. The road pieces fit in perfectly. Cities and settlements don’t have dedicated spots however.This thing is awesome!

For beauty mainly, but very hard to play with it! Does not work right! It's just a nice decoration.
","

  For beauty mainly, but hard to play with, since pieces/checkers don't slide and get stuck on fabric stiches & vinyl triangles, and have no finger groove s hence they are too slippery for hand grip or sliding by finger. The box sides are too low  and dices jump out often.  It looks nice, but for those of you who really want to relax and enjoy playing it will be annoying, as it takes an extra effort and caution to play compared to the simply wood ones. So as a decoraion to be shelved it's OK, but as to actually playing with it I would avoid it.  Obviously the Chinese manufacturer is not a savvy backgammon player...

I actually leave it up on my game table under the glass table top to protect it. It looks like a bit of art deco. My first purchase was the small box version... way too small for comfortable play. Second purchase was the Jumbo Tube. That was the perfect size matt. But the tube is too big. Then I saw the box version of the same jumbo size soft matt and bought it for my week ends away. I don't store it in the box (except for travel). I kept it rolled up in a drawer so it lays flat when playing. If your looking for the largest jumbo matt read the descriptions carefully & see the game description that tells you the exact inches. It's easy to buy the wrong one. It's worth the price! Have fun!

  Once you read the instructions and get use to the game play, which is simple, this is a nice game. There were six of us playing so we followed the recommendations and had two teams of two people. Using the team concept is required when their are over 3 people playing, as you have only three colors of chips. Teams are made with  every other person around the table, so each team gets two chances to form a sequence. Each chip has two side. One is plain and one has some white writing on it. You use the plain side up until you make a sequence then you turn the ones making the sequence over. I mention this as I wish the writing was a bit bigger and whiter. A minor thing but a suggestion. I would definitely recommend this game for a family or group of friends.BTW, 4 Stars is my highest rating as I do not ""love"" things.

This is a classic example of unfair Chinese trade practices that harm U.S. companies.Wish I would have paid closer attention before ordering.  Recommend you stay with the original JAX product:  JAX Sequence-Deluxe Edition.

GREAT SIZE AND MATT

  I love this board. It is large but it is perfect for us older folks. Nice size. It is hard to reach if you have short arms but that doesn't hinder the game at all. I highly recommend it for older people. My friend had the small version and we had to strain to see it. So, I thought I will buy this just to see if it is better. It had mixed reviews. I say BUY IT...

I love the bigger board
","

  I love the bigger board.  I was able to get the folded creases out of the mat by placing the mat face down on my ironing board, placing a t-shirt over the fold, spraying a little water on the t-shirt, and ironing it on the low silk setting.  It came right out and did not damage the mat.  Of course, I will not fold it in the future.  However, when we first opened the box, we were hit with a very strong chemical smell that was nausiating.  Yes, this was before I ironed it.  The toxic smell has lingered for hours, and we finally put it in the garage to air out.  Hoping that we don't have to return it because of the smell.

  We play the game with friends a couple times a week. It is a game of strategy and visual acuity. Very nice quality soft vinyl table top playing mat. There are several complaints about the ridges where the mat is folded. Simple solution - lay it out flat on a hard surface and lay a warm damp towel along the fold and gently rub the towel along the ridge. Also let it lay flat overnight with a couple books on it. Worked great for me.

  I bought the box version of this thinking I would get a foldable board with it. Instead I got the flimsy one folded up inside.... it stays creased and makes it very hard to sit chips on where it is folded up.

  What a bummer. The box arrived crushed. A sturdy box is a must when the game has lots of pieces (cards and lots of chips). The mat is merely a folded piece of felt with a light printing of the usual sequence board. I’m not sure how well it will flatten for game play, since it is folded in the box for storage. I’m a big Sequence player and was really looking forward to having a bigger “board” for larger family gatherings. This product does not meet the standards of the original sequence game. Very disappointed with the purchase, especially for the price.

  Because the card mat has been folded in a box (an admittedly large box), the mat has a crease right down the middle.  We've tried to flatten out the crease by leaving the mat out at night with heavy books on it.  That has helped, but didn't completely eliminate the crease.  The edges of the mat turn up a bit, as well.But I love the game and we play it often.

  On the regular board, people who have a hard time seeing find it difficult to find positions for their plays. I always tell them to follow the suit they want to play, until they find the card they are looking for. There are two sequences of each suit.On the bigger board, the cards are easier to see making the game more challenging as people can find their plays easier. This makes the game more fun!!! As the person with the best eyesight is not always the winner.

  Gotta have this classic card game that involves strategy. The best art of the game is that you can play with as many as 8-10 people. This version comes with a cushioned board which will likely last for a long period of time. Please do not buy any version of the game that does not offer a cushioned mat (board). Go buy this! I am not happy with the price. I think this should be priced at $29.99 and NOT close to $50. I gave 4 star considering the value for the price. Overall, very pleased with this product.

  I am pleased with the game but for some reason, didn't expect the board to be an actual mat - I though it would be a larger sized board.  It is a pain to store as if you keep it folded up because it will always stay bumpy, so I keep it opened all the time and draped over the back of a couch!!

  I had the Jumbo Sequence round version for a while and while it was really nice and large, it was a pain to store. Its in this big jumbo round cylinder and it was always in the way. If you tried to stick it in a cabinet it took up so much room and it would be the only thing on that shelf.Now this one is perfect. Just as big but folds up so nice and neat. I have a little OCD about things being out and messy. A couple people mention its hard to flatten, but I haven't found that to be the case. The one in the round cylinder was harder if you ask me. It was always popping.If your on the hinge about the two, trust me, you'll love this one much better. I gave the jumbo one in the cylinder to family.

  This is a fun game we play often with friends. We had the smaller game which was difficult to play with four on a regular size table. The bigger game board was a good size but difficult to keep smooth which made placing the chips flat difficult. We purchased an acrylic sheet to place on top to hold it flat.

  Love the game but I think the packaging is too much. I think all Sequence canvases should be packaged in a cylinder with the cards and chips. You have to keep the canvas rolled in order for it to lay mostly flat on a surface so once you open the box, you can't put the canvas back in the box since it will be creased which means you are just using this oversized boxed for two decks of cards and three bags of chips.

A D20 disguised as a strategy game.
","

  Tsuro gives the illusion of being a strategy game but ends up being completely random. My lunch break game group tested this theory  by playing a 4th hand randomly, only turning the radomly selected tile orientation clockwise when it flipped up as an illegal (suicidal) move. The randomly played hand came in 2nd place out of 4 when 3 other players were legitimately playing with forethought and strategy.That being said... some people in my game group found the game fun despite its randomness as they were able to ""turn off their brain"" to play and games took around 5 to 10 min to complete. Others, myself included, found it as boring as rolling a D20 after the 3rd or 4th game. I quickly sold the game to one of people in my game group who liked it.This is probably a good game with/for kids. However, if you are looking for at least a small degree of strategy, you would likely want to avoid this particular game.If you really like random games, exploding kittens is a far better option than Tsuro in my opinion since kittens doesn't feel as repetitive as quickly.

  Tsuro is a tile laying game where you're trying to stay on the board as long as possible.At the start of the game you set your piece at the edge of the board and with each tile you lay on the board you follow the lines on the board. The only rule really is that you can't purposely make yourself go off the edge so if you have a tiles you can lay that would keep you alive then you have to play that tile.I've played this game with my 5 years old and my 10 year old and they both love it. It's not a hard game to pick up so if you're looking for a game that the whole family can play I highly suggest this one.

Fantastic, quick game!
","

  I saw this game on Wil Wheaton's ""Tabletop"" web show and was immediately hooked.  If you haven't seen it already, go there NOW. [...]The premise is that you (and up to 7 other players) are dragons, flying around the board.  You place a tile on the board and place your dragon on one of the lines printed on the tile.  You then move your dragon along the line to the end of the tile.  Everyone else does this on their turns.  On your next turn, you place another tile adjacent to the one you played previously, so that the lines of the two tiles line up.  You then move your dragon along the new line until it terminates.  The winner of the game is the one who stays on the board the longest.  That's it.While it sounds boring and simple, the game has some strategy involved.  The tiles drawn are random, so it's very possible to draw three tiles that ultimately throw you off the board; or could throw an opponent off.  You must plan ahead to ensure that you don't get put into such a position.  However, there's not much use in planning more than 1-2 moves in advance, as your opponents' moves will (near the end of the game) greatly affect your plays.With more than 4-5 players, the game would get hectic very quickly.  I've only played with 4 people, but it was still really fun.  The first 4-5 turns are relatively boring, as the other players' tiles generally won't interact with your own.  It's when you begin linking tiles that things get really interesting and unforeseen connections are made that win or lose the game.The game plays out (with 4 players) in about 10-15 minutes, so it's a great game to break out while waiting for the rest of your group to arrive.  It's also a nice break between longer games like Settlers of Catan or Lords of Waterdeep.  Simple, fun, and quick.  Can't ask for much more!The production value of the game is quite high as well.  The tiles come on ~2mm thick, plastic-coated cardboard tiles.  The playing board is also of similar quality.  The ""dragon"" pieces are plastic, which disappointed me a little, as I thought they'd be stone or some other ""higher quality"" material.  But they're fine as they are.  I can see this game lasting a very long time.  My only real complaint is that there's no frame into which you could play the tiles.  As such, they tend to slide around on the board a little as the interior pieces are played.  Having a frame of some kind to keep the pieces lined up would be nice, but is more to satisfy my nit-picky personality.Two enthusiastic thumbs-up for this one!

  My husband and I first played this game when we were visiting friends in Ohio. They are big ""board gamers"" so whenever we go up to see them we play a bunch of games and figure out which ones we want to purchase for our home game library.They hadn't played this game yet either so we all learned together, which took all of three seconds. The game, though very simple, is surprisingly fun and tricky. We love how you have rethink your strategies and plans as others come into your paths and how now two game experiences will ever be the same.The game itself is absolutely beautiful, with great detailed artwork. It is really well put together. The board, the pieces, the card tiles, even the directions are just so pretty and delicate looking we enjoy just looking at the game. We quickly bought this game as soon as we got back home in Florida and have played it many many times since.We love that so many people can play at once so no friends get left out when we have a crowd. We call this our ""starter game"" because it is so simple and easy to learn, even the least experienced gamers can catch on and get in a gaming mode with a quick game of Tsuro. Even though we plan to only play one game before starting a more involved and lengthy game our guests often request that we play a second or even third time because they enjoy it so much.

Wonderful game for family and light gamers
","

  This is a great board game to play with children and with friends who might quite not be into board games. It's a game that is easy to set up and take down and with only a few rules to learn. The object of the game is to be the last one standing. During your turn, you decide on a tile to place in front of your stone. Your stone follows the path of tile until it reaches the end of the tile. It could essentially move forward, left right or even backwards. Other players place tiles down in front of their own marker, taking care to avoid paths that could lead them onto the edge of the board or into another player's marker (these are the losing conditions). The game is easy to learn but becomes quite intense as the space on the board fills up and there are only so many decisions left before eventually all but one players falls of the board.It's a great light game that is both elegant and beautiful.

Always picked by my 6 year old for game night.

  My kids love this game. Its extremely simple to learn, so it's my 6 year olds favorite.  Basically you take turns placing tiles down and having your game peices follow the path. Other players tiles can affect your path and change your destination.  Last player to exit the board, wins. You can also lose by running into another player. The game plays quickly for us when all 4 of us are playing, and we play 2-3 rounds at a time, before moving on to a different game choice.The kids love it because it's simple and you can quickly play it over and over again. As an adult, I can only play it so many times in a row, and probably would choose something a bit more mind stimulating,  however it can be competitive if I were to play against just adults and trying to doom their peices.My 9 year old likes the game enough to play it happily, but also asks for other games after 2 plays. My 9 year old and I love splendor.Tsuro player peices are plastic and the cards are thick cardboard.My toddler and 6 year old also play with it by putting all the tiles on the board and pretending they are roads or railroads and first to get to the dragon piece wins- although that's not a real game, they are entertained by it.Overall this is a fun family game and I reccomend it to those with younger kids (I have 3-9 year olds). The game is fun enough for my entire family, hubby included, and it will be well loved for years.

Poor Quality Components Ruin a Good Game
","

  UPDATE: I did reach out to Calliope about this issue and asked for a replacement. They requested a photo of the bar code on the box in order to facilitate my request. I did so and shared my contact information.  It’s been 6 weeks and I have heard nothing. My game is unplayable. I can not recommend buying any Calliope games due to their lack of quality control. Huge disappointment—I wish I would have returned it to Amazon the minute I opened it.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Really poor quality. I am so disappointed with this product. I have played this game virtually via Steam and absolutely loved it. But the quality is terrible. Not worth the price I paid at all. The cardboard tiles have very rough edges and most are chipped and cracked on the corners. Additionally, the art work on the tiles is so washed out that you can barely see which lines are which. They included a catalog of games which is on extremely expensive card stock with glorious full color photos. If only they’d spent that money on quality components. Game is fun, but the tiles are uncomfortable to hold and will degrade with only a few plays. I will not be buying another Calliope game ever and will tell every gamer I know to avoid this one. Waste of money. I feel like Calliope should either refund my purchase price or send me a reprint. Do not buy this game!!

Quality Control Issues Affect Playability
","

  UPDATE: I did finally receive a response from customer service on 3/9/20 after originally reaching out on 2/21/20. They did offer to send me new tiles but I’ve already returned the game at this point. I’m adding an extra star since they were willing to replace the tiles for me but I still feel the response was too delayed.TL;DR: easy & fairly fun game that’s simple to learn but quality of game pieces is less than spectacular.The long version: Here’s the thing- I love the concept of this game. It’s quick to teach and to play, and easy for those used to less involved strategic games to learn. This was the reason I purchased, to have something that’s not your standard Hasbro game but is easy enough to play with friends and family who don’t play as many or as complex of games as we do. i really wanted to love this one.But..The first time we played it, we found so many quality issues with the game tiles. Tiles were cut way over the printed areas, leaving discolored and/or white streaks that should have been part of the excess cut away and disposed of. This also means the paths are not centered on the tiles as they should be, so they don’t all match up when placed next to one another. Probably half our tiles were like this, making gameplay a bit confusing as you had to pay careful attention to paths to make sure you stay on your original one. There also seemed to be an issue when the tiles were cut, one corner on many of them appears to be separated almost- the decorative layer chipping off. See photos for examples of all the issues I’ve described.I reached out to the company, Calliope Games, via the customer service email listed on their website. This was a week ago. My ideal resolution would have been the option to have new tiles mailed to me to make my game playable and presentable. To date, I haven’t received so much as an automated response saying my message had been received and I would hear back in # days. I feel a week is more than reasonable to expect a response from a company that has any consideration of their customers at all.I can’t in good conscience recommend this game or any other from Calliope Games as customer service is nonexistent and the product has quality control issues that affect gameplay. I’ll be returning my copy to Amazon.If you decide to purchase anyway, may the odds be ever in your favor.

Another great game for hours of fun with the family
","

  Another great game for hours of fun with the family.Synopsis: You are a dragon flying around trying to not hit another dragon, or fall off the map.The game is a tile placement game. Simple as that. Each tile has a set of paths on it. When you place a tile in front of your dragon marker you follow the path you create. Each tile can be rotated to change the outcome of the placement. If you hit the edge of the map, or another dragon you are dead and leave the game, returning your unused tiles to the draw pile.The game is perfect for 4-8 players. Any less and it is still fun, just not as enjoyable in my mind.This is a great game for kids, or to break the ice in a gaming night event. With game play limited to about 30 minutes for a full game, you can easily complete 1-3 rounds in an hour as a warm up to a bigger more involved game.

Beautiful, Simplistic and Fun!
","

  This is one of the most beautifully, simplistic, and fun games, with a ton of replay value, that I have every played!Of all the games that I have - everyone (friends and family) love to play this game and is requested every time we get together.The artwork on the box, game board, tiles, instructions, dragons is beautifully drawn. The rules are simple, you have 3 tiles in hand (different paths are drawn on them), place a tile, more your dragon along the path, and be the last dragon left on the board.The more people that play (8 total) the more fun and strategy there is to keep on the board without falling off (due to your tiles paths or someone else's connecting path) or colliding with another dragon. The games are also fairly quick so if you fall off the board early it's not a long wait to play again.This is an amazing, simplistic, beautiful, high replay, very fun game for casual and hardcore board gamers of all ages!Comparison to its sister game: Tsuro: Of The Seas / Why I bought Tsuro:TGOTP over T:OTS~ 'Of The Seas' plays just like Tsuro:TGOFP but has some new elements. With artwork just as beautiful the board which is a little bigger (7x7 grid). There are sea monsters that roam the seas, able to remove the paths that they cross & can destroy you if you collide with them.I bought 'The Game Of The Path' over 'Of The Seas' because 'Of The Seas', I think, added too many mechanics (the sea monsters - that move around the board - every single time a player moves based on a dice roll) can knock you out of the game extremely early (especially with more people playing) and removes path tiles that they land on top off - allowing new tile to be placed there: This extended the play time a lot - so if you got knocked out of the game early on, you would be waiting a while before you could play again. You can still play the 'TGOTP' way with 'OTS' by removing the monsters and only playing with a (6x6) grid, but I loved 'TGOTP's artwork more and (since I play with a lot of people) I didn't want that extra wait variable time.

  Got this game because I played it at a work party, and it was fun and ready to learn. I knew my kids would be able to play it, including my 8-year-old twins.My family enjoys it. It is easy to learn and easy to play. It doesn't require a ton of thought, so it is a game friends can play while talking. No complicated rules and not too much in the way of strategy.The board and pieces are constructed well and are really nice.Not recommended for people who like complicated games with lots of strategy. Recommended for people who want something fun to do while talking and hanging out

A bit too easy and a bit boring
","

  Nothing wrong with my order, it was delivered quickly and everything was new and undamaged.  This is a review of the item specifically.We were really excited to get this game, it looked cool and we wanted more games with an eastern feel to them.  This game seemed perfect and I thought there would be some level of strategic depth to the game after reading reviews, etc.  However, after playing it once or twice it seemed like we had the game mostly figured out and it got boring pretty quickly (you can play a game in 5-10 minutes very easily).  I expected to get more play time out of this, at least with replay value but that sadly wasn't the case for me.  This game might keep the attention of someone in the range of 6-10 years a bit longer, but even then I think your money could be better spent elsewhere (perhaps I would be more happy with this game if it were in the $10-$20 range and not the $40-$50 range, it doesn't even feel like you get a bunch of pieces to make the game worth it).  If you want games with an eastern feel (of various difficulties) that have at least some replay-ability I would look into Takenoko or Lotus.  Tokaido is also more interesting and Hanamikoji is an excellent 2-player card game.

Great game for any size group!
","

  We learned to play Tsuro while visiting family and they gifted us our own box. It is a very simple concept - start your pawn on a hashmark on the side of the board, then place tiles with pathways on them and follow the pathways. You are out if you build a pathway that runs you off the side of the board or into another pawn. The last player standing wins. A round of the game takes 10-15 minutes, but it is endlessly replayable, as every round will be different from before. It is entertaining with two, three, four, or six players (probably with five, seven, and eight as well, I just haven't played those group sizes). It fits nicely into the category of games that are fun for the whole family (to use the cliche). My 7 year old loves to play, but my husband and I can also enjoy ourselves. I highly recommend it for parents dying to get family game night out of the Candyland/Connect 4 cycle and into games a little more interesting for adults and for couples looking for a game that is as good with two people as with a bigger group.

  I absolutely am in love with this game! It's a great family game. Even my 4yo can play it with minimal assistance. Easy Concept and instructions (tho were still trying to figure out the dragon card) and a great way to let kids learn critical thinking and strategy skills without the complicated rules of traditional strategy games like risk or strategy.Rounds are relatively quick so we keep it near the dining room table to break out after supper. Everyone from my grandparents to cousins now love this game and I can't wait to gift it!We can't wait to get iterations 2 and 3 now! Excellent game. I'd give it a million stars if I could.

A Delightfully Simple Addition To Any Collection
","

  I bought this game not because it was complex or required a strategy book, but because it was beautifully simple and an elegant game to play with anyone.Some of my family members consider some of the other games in my collection daunting or draining because of the rulebook and setup times and strategy that can be involved. By getting this, it's as simple as unfolding the board, picking a colored stone, and three tiles. It's impossible to be intimidated by this game and even after dozens of rounds between family and friends it's still a great time to play and have fun with, even when I'm used to games that last more than 10 minutes. It's impressive design that none of the paths ever lead to a dead end too, although you CAN make orphaned circle paths with some select tiles, players won't ever be able to be on those paths. Every so often I'm still surprised by some of the scenarios this path building game can provide although I admit, the depth of strategy does have diminishing returns after a 15 or 20+ matches for any seasoned board game geek. :)The art and build quality are top notch, although I wish the stones/pawns were a heavier plastic. It's easy to forgive though for the enjoyment and inclusion this game has brought to me and my family members who don't normally like to play games at game night. Couldn't be happier! I highly recommend it.

  I like this game... but it was over priced.Also, it is way to easy to die and so the game isn't that fun after a while.this is a game I would play maybe 5-6 times and then it would sit in my game pile forever. So enjoyable but not something I can see getting played a lot of time and definitely not something that would be picked first.Will update if things change.We also made some house rules since dying was so easy, perhaps this is something you could do.This game left me feeling like more could be added or something was missing to this game.

Easy game with some strategy, brings in non gamers.
","

  This game is fantastic and draws people in who normally are not table top gamers.Pro: This game is extremely easy to learn, the mechanic of it is very fun,  and the more people you have the more fun it is.  The design of the game is very simple, yet very exciting and relatively fast paced.  You get through a game in 10 min and the thinking that is involved is good solid strategically thinking.Con: My only draw back with this game is how repayable it is.  You could argue that the game is different every time, and this is true from a piece, location and movement aspect, but the strategies don’t change.  Most of the fun is in your first 5 games learning a strategy that works, and from here you are never forced to re-invent yourself or adjust your main strategy.  This can get a bit boring (especially for more advanced gamers).Kids:  I have a 7 year old and a 5 year old who play and love this game.  They didn’t struggle with understanding the rules at all, and love playing the game.  They love to push their pawns towards each other and turn at the last minute (which is actually a very good strategy moving towards the middle of the board and then claiming a side to try and stall out the other players).  I would recommend it for a mature 5 year old and certainly for 6 and 7 year olds and older who like games.Overall:  This game rocks overall, the only con I had was a slight one, and people who play it once or see it played usually get excited to continue to play it.  This has become a family favorite, it is also a game we know we can break out at any time, with any crowd anywhere and have fun with.

A Really Well Designed, Simple, Fast Paced Game
","

  It's a game that is as long or short as the time it takes for someone to choose their move. You can learn this game in less than 5 minutes, but it is extremely fun with amazing replay value. Because the tiles are randomly chosen you can actually play this game endlessly and never play the same game twice. Even small children can learn this game. It's great for squeezing into a short time span, and the more people you have the faster it plays. As each player takes their turn it limits the space on the board other people may travel, and in a short amount of time you either are the last one on the board or you get forced off the board and eliminated. Very simple, but highly addictive game. It's easy to play two or three rounds in a row without getting bored of it. The artwork of the board itself is also beautifully done, and almost frame worthy by itself. There's nothing about this game to complain about. Definitely a favorite at our house.

  We have brought this game to play with our youth group's high school students, we have played with our 6 year old nephew, and we brought this game to play with some family internationally.  Everyone loved it! :D  It excellent for all ages. We especially like to play cooperatively where all players attempt to stay on the board to make it to the final space.  We have had success with that several times!  It is also a great game to play with bilingual communities, it is easy to learn, and learning is not contingent on accessing a lot of linguistic information. We played with friends and family who spoke other languages, and after we got the basic point across, everyone loved it.  Enjoy!

  Update: I brought this with me to my friends ""game night""  5 of us played, it was pretty fun specially once you can get some tactics going. Two people were forced out because of cards some one else played that sent them on a path off the board.  They too had the ""wow this game looks really nice"" thing going on as i unboxed it and set it up.  I just wish it came with a few more cards so no one runs out as we get close to the end of the game and there are still a few players still on the board.I bought this version over the new version because I feel it looks way better.  After playing a few rounds, i kind of wish i had the extra play options of the new version.  This game just looks good when you open it up and lay out the pieces though.  Even their catalog looks like a game book, not an advertisement.  The game board almost looks like you could frame it and hang it on a wall.  My wife and son did enjoy it, but after a few rounds they were good and we moved on to another game.  It's more fun the more people you have play.  I feel the new version would work if you only had a few people to play, gives you more to do.  If you had more people playing at once, i think this version would be better than the new version.

  This game is great! I've played it among several different groups of people, and ended up playing several sequential rounds each time. I think it appeals to a lot of people because it strikes a happy middle in regards to luck and strategy. The game is also really beautiful. The board and the instructions are attractive and easy to understand/intuit, and the little stone-like player pieces are lovely too. They're made of a very smooth material that feels great, they're weighted and shaped nicely so that they stand well on the board but aren't heavy to hold/move, and they come in a really lovely variety of colors, the shades of which are a nice change from most other game pieces. Overall, the aesthetic of the game is superb.

A fast, fun game!
","

  You might be tempted to consider the more recent Tsuro of the Seas game instead, but the original has a certain charm and simplicity that is hard to argue with.  The play is fast and easy for as few as two players, and as many as eight.  Though with more than four players it's extremely strategy heavy almost from move #1.You are a Chinese dragon, flying around the board.  Your path is defined by the lines on tiles you play, of which you have three in your hand to choose, as long as there are three available to be chosen.  Each tile has two points on each of its four sides and path lines so that all eight points go somewhere.  You play the tile of your choice and follow the path thus created until it ends.  You may span multiple tiles.  If you fly off the board or crash into another player, you lose.  Last player still on the board wins.The packaging and presentation on this game is downright elegant as board games go.  I bought it as a gift for my GF so that she would have a fun, simple game that plays quickly and can be picked up by young players, and she absolutely loved the presentation.In practice, though, the game falls a little short with the ten plastic stones that represent your dragons.  The bases simply aren't large enough to give them ideal stability on the table.  And since the stones are obviously plastic and not some natural material (impractical for a production at this price point), you almost wish the stones were less authentic and more likely to remain standing up.  I'm still looking for an ideal replacement or a way to weight the bottoms of the included stones.  For now, we break out some other game's player markers.

  Just a fantastic, supremely easy game to learn and finish. Games last no more than about 10 or 15 minutes, depending on how many people are playing. It will often be described as a great 'entry' and/or 'warm-up' game when you first sit down with a group of friends/family.As someone that had come from a background of Monopoly and Risk, Tsuro was one of the earliest games I recall playing that was 'unique.' Makes for a great gift for any and all ages. If you're looking for an in-depth, complicated game for a hardcore gaming group.. then keep looking.

  What an inventive but simple game with lots of replay-ability. The artwork is elegant and zen-like. This game is so simple a 7 or 8 year old could easily play, possibly even younger if they're sharp. However, just because a young child could play, it doesn't mean it's not fun or challenging for adults. The goal is to be the last dragon left on the board. You wind your way around the board following the path you build with the tiles. The trick is to not run yourself off the side of the board or into another dragon all while trying to thwart your opponents' dragons from doing the same. This is our favorite game this year and we have purchased it as gifts for at least 7 other families. Good, fun stuff with easy setup and quick play. Fun to fill those short down times when you need a little something to do but don't have time to break out a big game. We usually play 2 or 3 rounds in a sesion and that lasts about an hour that way.

Pieces Slide Everywhere Due To Poor Design
","

  I recently bought this game and have played a few times. Unfortunately it was not designed well. The squares that you play on has one flat side edging and one with rounded side edging, and the flat side isn’t facing down. This makes the pieces slide all over the board way too easily. If you have Carcassonne you could see what I mean. This game should have been designed with the flat side down.The game itself is pretty, but there are so many pieces that send you back to the corners that it wasn’t too fun.

Tsuro, Great Game for all Ages
","

  I purchased the game 'Tsuro' for an upcoming family reunion. The reviews I'd researched stated the game being very easy to learn and play and they were absolutely right. The game is very easy to get into and play. There can be as few as 2 people playing or as many as 8 which makes it quite desirable for a party as you may not know how many attendees may become bored or may draw interest and this game when it's brought out so Tsuro has that aspect covered wonderfully, plus it doesn't require much effort on your part to teach to any newcomer which is something I personally love about it. It has moderate replay value, I found after 4 or 5 games we were satisfied and ready for something else. The games move at a quick pace and usually takes around 15 minutes to complete. A fun aspect is the fact that one person's tile placement may run others off the board which can create fun and comradery among those playing. Though this game is often put in the 'Toy' genre, it is a board game and will satisfy anyone from ages 8 to 80. The product is well made, colorful, and should last a lifetime. If you're looking for a board game that doesn't require effort to explain and get going, Tsuro will delight you. I give it 5 stars.

  My wife and I purchased this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter. I have not had an opportunity to play the game with her yet, but I received a positive response and a big ""Thank you"" from her. She let me know that she has been playing with her parents and brother and they have been enjoying the game and family time together.

Fun, easy, low stress game play.
","

  This is not a board game in the classical sense. I can't stress this enough. Tile placement and blind luck are the best ways to describe the game play. Some say that there isn't strategy. There is, but it is limited to holding back a more adventitious tile for late game. Playing with more people makes the game go faster, but make you feel like you have little control over. It seems more like watching the game than playing.I know  you read that and think, ""Why give it 4 stars with those complaints?""  I remember a time when social interaction was something that was sought, not shied away from. When I was a kid and my parents would travel across town to play a card game or board game with their friends. It was game night and we kids had our own version of it. It was about a friendly game that you could enjoy, with people you enjoyed. Tsuro brings that back. I recommend it for that reason. If you are looking for a highly competitive game, pass this one by.

Great game for multiple ages
","

  This game is amazing in its ease of play and strategic depth. It is easy enough the I was able to teach it to my 8 year old niece, and yet it entertains me. I am usually very strategy oriented playing with table top miniature games. The game is quick (15 minutes) so multiple games can (and will) be played when you get together with friends. It plays two to eight people which make this a very flexible game.A simple description of the rules goes like this: you have 3 tiles in your hand with lines as paths for you playing figure to follow. You place the tile in front of your figure and it has to follow the path you set before it. The strategy comes in when you get close to other figures on the playing board. If you place a tile in front of your figure which is also in front of another figure, every figure must follow the path that is placed before them, even if it sends them off the board or crashing into another figure.  Lastly, if your first move is to go straight then this is called the Amanda Gambit (house rule).

  I love this game. It's simple, it's beautiful, and it's fast. It's just as fun to play with two players as it is a large group, which can't be said for a lot of my other board games. I think it would be a good choice for getting kids into board games; it makes them make their own strategic decisions and it's fast paced so they won't lose interest before it's over. That being said, it's still fun for more hardcore players that want to take a step away from Eclipse or Scythe. I highly recommend.

Pure Elegance
","

  This game is elegant. Not just in the sense of being stylish or beautiful, but also in the sense of its simplicity. This is a game that is very easy to learn and teach to even the least nerdy person out there, but it can be played very strategically if you are a gamer who's accustomed to that sort of thing.The game's artwork and theme have absolutely nothing to do with the game, so it's a good thing that they're really really nice. The sheet of rice paper and rule pamphlet inside are a nice touch. Good job Mayfair.The game itself is so simple that you could explain the basic rules of the game in a single breath. Players start from the outside of the board and take turns placing tiles to create pathways. Avoid going off of the board and avoid crashing into other people. Done. The specifics of exactly how the game is played take another two minutes at most. Each session takes 15-30 minutes.For the gamers out there who are interested, I must say that the game is excellently designed. The game is set up such that all the players always have the same number of tiles in their hand, and there will never be a tie between two players for the victory. There are tons of different ways the tiles can rotate and the board can fill up, and yet it's very easy on the players because everything is visual. Also, since you can only have up to 3 tiles in your hand at a time, the game is so unpredictable that new players have pretty much the same chance of winning as a super-strategic player. There is no one strategy that wins all the time, and the endgame is always glorious because all the pathways connect and people go flying all over the place.

Deceptively Simple, Extremely Addicting
","

  I purchased this after watching Wil Wheaton play it on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMtlQxJeWvc). It's extremely easy to play. You are playing cards with lines on it and then your piece moves along those lines. I wanted something that anyone could learn in 5 minutes and wouldn't take long to play. This fit the bill perfectly.What I wasn't prepared for was just how much fun it would be to play. I first tested the game on some ""hardcore"" tabletop gamers; the kind who love in-depth games like Warhammer. I thought for sure they'd hate it. Imagine my surprise when they wanted to play it over and over again!I then tried it with family and friends. One person in the group absolutely hates playing games. Again, absolutely everyone loved it. I think the reason for this is that although the rules are simple, keeping your player on the board takes a lot of thought and some luck. No two games are ever the same, so it's unlikely you'll get bored with it.I should also mention that the production value of the game is top notch, which is why the game is a bit pricey. Everything is extremely high quality, so it's worth every penny.It's the type of game you'll always want to bring out at parties. Guaranteed fun for all ages.

  I have two game age children. We play A LOT of board and card games. This is one if our favorites. The tiles are substantial enough not to be damaged by rambunctious boys. I hope the game makers don't try to cheapen that aspect up. I really can't stress enough how the game feels well made and is beautiful and can stand up to two boys playing it. The dragon pieces are made of a pleasingly heavy resin. The tiles are heavy, thick cardboard with nice glossy printing. Oh yeah, and it's endlessly fun to play. It is really easy to learn and teach new players. Kids can play independently as long as they are old enough to remember to pick a new tile at the end of each turn. What is really fun about this game is that you can kind of mess with your opponents, but you don't always clearly see how your moves will play out. This is a great game for a group if adults, a few kids or a mix.

  So the point of this game is to be the last man standing. You can lie or tell the truth but regardless you want to be the last one left. The biggest problem I have found with this game is that no one wants to risk challenging someone because if you are wrong you lose a life. And if no one challenges anyone it basically becomes a game of who has the most tokens. So to make it more interesting we give anyone who challenges someone and is correct and extra 3 tokens and immunity to the next coup that happens. This gives people more of an incentive to challenge people

Amazon selling counterfeit Coup with defects; game unplayable

  Amazon sold me a counterfeit copy.  The quality was cheap and the rulebook had spelling errors - both not serious issues.  However, one of the role cards (Assassin) had notable ink markings on the back which gave its role away, which obviously ruined the game when playing with friends.The game publisher, Indie Boards & Cards, has been helpful with its customer support but ultimately stopped its support when they identified I had a counterfeit copy, which I understand.  They recommended I complain to Amazon, which I will later today.A shame, because I've played Coup many times with my friends (with their copies) and love the game!  Looks like owning my own copy will be a few more phone calls and shipments away.  Hoping I'm not forced to pay for a replacement.

Coup is good stuff. It's a small and fun game that ...
","

  Coup is good stuff. It's a small and fun game that is easy to explain. If you've got a group of four to six people and you're looking for some quick fun this is a great game to go to. It's small enough to carry someplace like a cafe without much hassle, and other than the pile of coins used in the game it doesn't take up that much space on the table. As far as space, every player just needs space for two cards and their stack of coins, and perhaps the small reference sheet to remind them of what each role's powers are. Small package indeed. I have even had a good 30 minutes of fun playing this game with a total of three people. Four or more is certainly the sweet spot however.The rules are easy enough to explain and the rounds are short enough that you can introduce it to newcomers quickly, and even if they are eliminated early it won't be long before a new game begins and they can get back into it. I have found the bluffing in this game to be so enjoyable that people are often looking to play ""one more round,"" which is a sign of a fun game. ""I have the Duke so I'm going to take two coins this turn..."" says a player as you stare at the Duke in your own hand... there's only two in the deck... Can he really have the other? Do you call his bluff or just let him have his two coins for now? Good times. At a price point of under $15 USD this game is hard to pass up. Because it's a bluffing game you'll want to be sure your cards don't get marked. You might want to consider sleeving them. The size is  65x100mm and the Ultrapro sleeves should fit fine.

Really fun hidden role game that everyone should try.
","

  Coup is a really fun hidden role game where you have multiple characters with different abilities they can do on their turn. Everyone on their turn can either take 1 coin, take 2 coins, use their character ability or throw a coup (given you have the coins needed) which causes another player to reveal 1 of their 2 characters....if both of your characters are revealed you're out of the game.The fun part is that no one else knows what two characters you have so you can use any ability in the game as long as no one calls your bluff. If they do call your bluff and you don't have that character then you lose a 1 of your characters. If you do have that character you reveal them, add them back to the communal deck and get a new card and the accuser loses a character themselves.Game is really fun and at the price it's currently at <$10 there's really no reason not to experience this awesome game.

Easy to play, fun, and gets everyone involved.
","

  Bought this at the recommendation of my brother and Amazon's seller rankings as a game to help break the ice with my girlfriend's family.The rules look a bit complicated, but it helped to think of the game as a version of rock-paper-scissors that includes lying and bluffing. That is, for every card there is an opposing character that can counteract it, and you can lie about which card you have. If called out, you're ""challenged"" and must reveal the card. If you prove to have that card, then the player who challenged you loses one of their two characters. If you lack the character, you lose one of your characters. The last surviving player wins.Ultimately, the game is simple and fun to play. More important, everyone gets into it, even after a few glasses of wine. The game worked a treat, and we were all talking, laughing, and waiting for the next twist in game play. With the game being so simple, a lot of the entertainment lies in the twists and turns created by bluffs, challenges, and coups.Lot of fun, and each game only takes bout 15 minutes.

Tons of fun.  Cards are not standard size though.

  I missed out on the kickstarter, but grabbed a couple copies of this game as soon as it was available on Amazon.  It's tons of fun to play, even with only 2 players.  Games are short (5-10 minutes).  Compared to other fun, short games like 

Love Letter

  , there is more strategy.  It also scales up well if you have more people.  It's hard to find a bluffing game that works with less than 5 people (I'm looking at you, 

The Resistance

   and 

Werewolf

  ).The product/manufacturer descriptions do not describe this game very well.  There are 5 different cards (and 3 copies of each).  Each one gives you a special ability within the game.  You are dealt 2 cards for your hand.  The goal is to force your opponents to turn over (discard) both of their cards.  Each turn you can choose to draw money from the bank or take a special action.  Actions include spending money to force an opponent to discard, stealing money from an opponent and taking extra money from the bank.  Cards can also be used even when it's not your turn to block others from taking certain actions.  However, since all cards are dealt face down, you are free to pretend you have *any* card and can take any action you want.  If someone challenges you, you have to either show that you have the card you claimed or you are forced to turn over a card (discarding it).  If someone challenges you and you were telling the truth, they are the one who has to discard.If you were to exclusively play this game for a long time with the same group of people, it might start to get old.  However, as part of a set of games you play on game night/lunch with coworkers/whatever, you could play this for years.  Beginners can pick it up quickly and it slots nicely into small amounts of free time.The game uses a non-standard card size (65x100mm).  If you want to protect the cards from wear, you can use 

Ultra Pro Special Size Card Sleeves

   or the more expensive 

Mayday Games 7 Wonders Sleeves

  .  The cards are fairly sturdy and durable though, and the game comes in a stiff box.  I would consider sleeving the cards anyway, since any card that gets scratched or bent will essentially ruin the whole deck.  The box includes a set of reference cards and cardboard coins to use for money.  To make the game more portable, you could summarize the actions on a piece of paper and use pennies.

Great intro to game night
","

  Our game nights start with simpler games before we get into complicated stuff like Ticket to Ride or Smallworld.  Coup is a great ""opener"", particularly for people who don't normally play games (you know the type, ""Hey do you play games?""  ""Well I play Monopoly sometimes...""  >:(  )Even though it's dead simple to learn (even non-gamers pick it up quickly) it relies a lot on each player's ability to bluff, and to call bluffs.  The basic mechanic is, 1) you can bluff your way into a better position, 2) anyone can call you out, 3) if you weren't bluffing, the accuser suffers a huge penalty, but if you were bluffing, YOU suffer a huge penalty.  So most of the game is spent with people bluffing their way into a better position, and everyone watching everyone else and paying attention to what the players are claiming they have... add in the ability to cover your tracks, and it makes for quite a lot of intrigue in such a little game.One other reason we use this as an opener is because the play time is relatively short (half an hour would be a longer game), and it's so interesting that by the end it doesn't really matter who wins, so there are almost never hard feelings.  The rules are also bulletproof: veteran gamers know that with independent games you're not guaranteed to have a perfectly functional set of rules, but that's not the case here.The art is also spectacularly good... I usually spend part of each game just looking at the art.We have also played The Resistance (same author) and it's as fun, but more complicated, and less fun art - also a great game, with a similar mechanic, but Coup gets played more.I found out about Coup through word-of-mouth and haven't been disappointed.  You won't be either if you take my word on it.

Super fun with the Right Group of People
","

  This is a bluffing card game that reminded my family of the game BS but with a faster play time and a dystopian theme.You'll need a few learning curve play-throughs to work through questions and challenges the rule book doesn't clearly address at first. We kept having questions pop up and there was some conflict with word choice we had to address that became confusing for a few turns. (The difference between ""blocking"" an action and calling out a player needed to be clearer for our game)But even the learning games were fun and everyone wanted to play again. The reference cards are essential until you figure everything out, and are handy for quick reference without getting out the rule book.This sort of game relies on the people playing for fun and challenge. If you have a good group, friends and family, then it is a lot of fun. Though a group of strangers wouldn't be nearly as entertaining. Even if you know the other players, it helps to have the right mix of personalities. For example, a person who hates lying or dishonesty, another who is incapable of a lie, and someone who isn't into joking around might not make for a fun game.Otherwise this is a really good time. Quick play and fun dynamics create a fun time between bigger games or even for a few plays. For the price it's definitely worth it.

Inconsistent color on back of cards
","

  I had played and enjoyed Coup before and thought I'd like to get my own copy and try Reformation. I bought my first copies of Coup and Reformation and the back of the cards were the same color; not even the slightest difference in shade could be seen. I ended up gifting these first copies to a friend and then decided to buy Coup and Reformation a second time to keep.I had seen reviews and posts online talking of this issue dating to since Reformation released, and I'm disappointed to discover it firsthand and that this issue has persisted for this long. For those with keen eyes, the Coup set is light gray with a slight green hue and the Reformation set is simply light gray. I have seen others online say they made contact with Indie Boards and Cards about the issue, and sadly their regular response was that these slight color differences are to be expected on different release runs and that their only recommendation (to avoid spotting the Inquisitor) is to mix the sets thoroughly so other characters from the Reformation set is included, which sounds like a half-baked solution, to be honest. I returned the 2nd copy of Reformation and tried replacing it with a 3rd Reformation set. Again, color difference.I am also uncertain if this color inconsistency is because of the Coup set, the Reformation set, or both. With this in mind, I am posting this review on both Coup and Reformation.I'm tempted to return these sets and try again, hoping to get a match like my first set of Coup and Reformation. It is disappointing that Indie would let this problem go on for so long.Come on, Indie. step up and fix this issue.

Coup Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction
","

  Coup: 2-6 Players, Ages 10+, Average Play Time = 15 MinutesOne might scoff at the fact that there’s only fifteen cards in the entire game, making the content feel rather light.  On the other hand, one could come to appreciate how the game mechanics tie everything together to give it its bang for the buck.  I was admittedly skeptical at first…”$12 for fifteen cards and some plastic coins?  What gives?” Once I actually looked at the rules however and saw just how many actions you could take per turn, I began to see the possibilities both in terms of strategy and bluffing.I have a feeling that this game won’t appeal to people who don’t play a lot of Poker, or any card game for that matter that encourages people to bluff when their back is against the wall. “Coup” works better when you have a lot of people playing, but it can and does function as a two player game just fine.  My suggestion is that if you do end up playing with four or more players, that you secretly remove a card from the deck so as to prevent people from counting cards as they figure out who has who.What appeals to me most is the quick play time, what with the recent changes that have come about in my household.  “Coup” allows me to flex my brain without committing myself to an hour or two to some heavy abstract strategy game.  It also tests my memory a bit, especially when my opponents use three different character actions in one round without exchanging cards…which was the lie?  Do they know that I caught them?  What actions have I taken again and didn’t someone use the Duke recently to block foreign aid?  You see where this is going.  Anywho, I found “Coup” to be great as a filler or something to bring out at parties.  My recommendation is to give it a spin!

The player count is less than in Resistance (2-6 players) but it definitely moves a lot faster. At first glance it seems like the rules are very complicated, but once you start playing you'll see that there is a nice flow to the game, very easy to catch on to. I even enjoy narrating the game, or even just watching and making predictions when there are more than 6 of us. Its also great that there are so many different strategies to play, and definitely very surprising to see how the game pans out. I was very pleasantly surprised with this one! Oh, and if you end up enjoying this game you definitely need to try Resistance (5-10 players). They are very different games, by the way, but similar in a few regards. Both are inmensely fun. I havent tried the expansions, but they seem killer.

  This game is fun when you have like 3+ players. It's easy to learn and isn't luck-based like UNO. I also like how there aren't too many cards so I don't have to lug around this heavy box of cards and then having to shuffle and stuff. I just wish the people on the cards looked prettier because they look pretty ugly. Especially the ambassador and the captain and the duke. The assassin looks like Taylor Swift. Also, why is the Contessa wearing that necklace thing like that? Just put it on your neck already.

  Great game! This was initially shown to me by my partner at a local board game bar and decided to purchase it here because it’s really fun to play. I love that it’s super easy to learn, they have cards as reminders of what each character can do and that it’s fairly small game to carry.My friends and I just all end up lying to each other then seeing who has the most courage to call each other out. Many times there’s 4 of us and somehow we’re always the duke??? There’s only 3 in the deck, haha! Fun stuff.

Put on your polka face!
","

  What a fun game!  It took a little while to get to know the characters and what their special powers are, but there is a cheat sheet provided to each player to help.  Bluffing is the key to the game...you need to have a polka face at all times.  The object of the game is to make your opponents surrender the two cards that each player is dealt....and then you become the winner.  Since your opponents do not know what characters you have been dealt...you can easily (sometimes) dupe them into thinking you are a character that you are not simply by using that polka face.The game is a lot of fun...takes maybe ten minutes a round to play...and you get better with each time you play as you learn to strategize.

  Very fun game. Can be played with a lot of players and each round doesn’t take long. People may think you need to be good at bluffing, but some of the friends who can’t lie to save their lives were being very successful and winning several rounds. It’s also simple to learn game after playing just one round. Maybe 2. My parents struggle with a lot of board games unless they’re classics, but they understand this one east and enjoyed it. Rounds typically last between 5-15 min depending on how many players. Great game for its price and replay value.

One of the few available 6-player travel games that is fun
","

  I bought this game to play while traveling with a group of 6 people.  It is really hard to find a game that is compatible with 6 players and can travel well.  While I think the ideal number is 3-4 players, this game worked out really well with the six.  It also did not take up much space in my bag.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it isn't my favorite games genre; however, I have no regrets in buying it.More details:Just a quick overview of the game.  It plays quickly -- over in 15-20 minutes.  It is a game mostly built around bluffing, calling bluffs, and eventually backstabbing (or not depending on how you play).  Each player starts two character cards.  You are out once you lose both cards. The last person standing wins.The interesting aspect is that not only does each card type grant the player a special ability but that the cards are also flipped over.  Since they are hidden from the other players, you can claim to use a power to which you don't have a right.  Every turn a person has the right to challenge you.  If you aren't using a ability granted by your cards, you lose a card.  If the challenger is wrong, he loses a card.  There are also other ways to attack and defend other players using a card's special ability.  They seem pretty balanced.Overall, it is a fast-paced game.  You sort of get an idea how people like to play.  Some bluff, some don't.  You can also see some interesting natural alliances that form between people (one couple also supported each other, the other one did seemed to always attack each other).  And because the games go quickly, you have a chance for revenge.The gameplay is different with 6 players because the reserve deck is much smaller.  Almost all the card types are out, and you can't switch out as well.  So it makes it really hard to bluff and weakens some of the special abilities.  It is still fun though

Great for small gatherings!
","

  One of the most straightforward games you can get, yet endlessly fun. The fundamentals of the game can be taught in minutes, but the social dynamic will keep the game interesting indefinitely. There are 6 roles, represented as cards, each with their own unique abilities. Players are dealt cards face down with remaining cards in a pool. From there you must bluff, negotiate, and strategize your way to victory. The game is for up to 6 players, and while I find the more players the better, I have played most of my games with 4 players and it does not lose its complexity.This is not a game that you would dedicate an entire night to, as rounds last anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes, but I have ended up playing for a couple hours occasionally. Great game to introduce to people that do not play board games, to get a game night started, or as a casual game.

  My family enjoys this game and we have played several times.  It is hard as the adult to play this game with your kids because you have to target people and that can be tricky especially if you have a sensitive kid.  So far everyone has been fine with that but the adults tend to target each other more to keep the peace :) Would be more fun to play with friends who are all adults.  That said my kids really enjoy the game.  We alternate between this, One Night Werewolf and Exploding Kittens.

Not Much Fun for Only Two Players
","

  The one and only time I played this game was with one other person. It's downright boring as a two person game. It really just comes down to who can lie better and who actually has the better cards. The rounds are super quick with two people- I'm talking about maybe 5 minutes--probably less. It's not very satisfying or immersive when the two person rounds last so little time. The win doesn't feel quite as sweet.Gameplay reminds me of a more complicated version of BS. Perhaps this makes me a simpleton, but I prefer BS.Maybe with more people it could be fun, but I don't think they should advertise this as a 2-6 player game.

  Fun game of deceit with low enough rules so a new player can pick it up, while still having enough to be rewarding to experienced players. There are three copies of each of six roles, and each player is dealt two roles and can use certain powers based on what roles they have, but they can claim to have a role that they don't actually have and -- unless someone calls them on it, which is risky -- they get away with it. The game ends quick enough that even if you get eliminated early, it's really not a long wait (never longer than 10 minutes, if even 5). One small issue with the game is that it's pretty risky to call someone's bluff in general (you lose one of your two lives if you're wrong), but this is integral to the nature of the game. It's not a game with a guaranteed winning strategy either, and sometimes the winner is decided by an arbitrary case of one player killing you instead of another player, leaving that other player to kill him. Overall, the game is addictively fun and requires a good amount of thought to play.

  I LOVE Coup!! I first played it two years ago. It was the last week of uni. The SO were throwing us a campus-wide farewell party of sorts. Most of me mates were drunk, flying, or napping. A bunch of us got together in someone's flat, poured glasses of our preferred drinks, and pulled this out. It only took a few turns to catch up to the others, all of whom had played it plenty before.There's practically no set-up required. There's just enough of bluffing and strategy required to make it fun but not enough to be overly complex. Basically, you won't have to set apart 2-3 hours to play this game. You could play a few rounds and be done in 30 mins or go on for hours. You can play it with just two people but generally, the more the merrier. It also makes way for great banter. All in all, a great game, whether used as an ice-breaker or a bonding exercise.

Coup: strike while the iron is hot
","

  Actual dialogue from a Coup game:""I'm the Captain. I steal two coins from you.""""No you're not.""""Is that a formal challenge?""""No, I just know you're not the Captain.""""Anyone else going to challenge? Ok, I take your coins.""""You can't.""""Why not?""""I'm also the Captain.""Coup is a bluffing game for 2 to 6 players. At its core, it's a simple matter of acquiring coins and killing all opponents with them. The rules fit on a small card: a few ways to gain coins, a couple of ways to kill, one way to steal coins, and one way to change your hand. You have at most two out of five different roles available face down in your hand, and you spend your game trying to keep your hand hidden and alive.The beauty of Coup is that even though you only have two cards with their attendant powers, you can claim to have any power you want. The only way to stop you from exercising your power is to initiate a high stakes life-and-death challenge. Either the bluffer or the challenger will lose a card in a challenge, so the heart of the game is to deduce the hidden holding of the other players, and not let them get away with the brazen bluffs that will turn the tide in their favor.As in poker, but without complicated considerations of hand strength, the quest to go to the level below your opponent gives this game bottomless depth and replayability. The powers are a carefully balanced Rock Paper Scissors, and allow any initial holding, played well, to win the game. Coup also has built-in escalation mechanisms that avoid cyclical positions and virtually guarantee all games drive to a winner.Fast games can take five to ten minutes. A particularly epic game with many players might take an hour.If there is one possible complaint, it's that multiplayer endgame scenarios can get a little complicated. If the last players' holdings are obvious, it's tempting to try to mentally play out the rest of the game before figuring out which power you need to claim to have a shot at winning. This can slow down the game tremendously. You might want to put paralyzed analyzers on the clock.Even though you can probably make your own Coup out of a deck of cards and some ordinary household items, this is a well-made game. The rule sheets for each player are clear and well organized, the octagonal cardboard coins wear well, and the cards are large and easy to read.This is well worth your gaming dollars in the $15 or even $20 range. Obsessed friends paid $50 for Kickstarter editions. I wouldn't go so far, but it comes out in virtually every boardgaming session these days.

  We played this game last night with our niece and her hubby visiting from out of state. It was a blast! They had played before. It was our first time. Took a minute for me to pick up the strategy, but was super easy to learn.Games these days usually require a lot of players to have fun. This game, I feel, is best kept at 3-5 players. Six would work too, just might be a bit much in my opinion. The games goes so quickly that it’s easy to play a lot of them. One might go so far as to say addicting and can’t stop playing “just one more”. LOL it’s a different dynamic every time cuz obviously your cards change.Truth be told...when we sat down with them to play...I thought that it was going to be stupid but wanted to be a good sport. hahaIt’s super fun and I’m buying one now for myself!

  Coup is a crowd-pleaser, there's no denying. This quick, little card game handles 2 to 6 players and can be played in fifteen minutes or less, making it a great addition to game nights. It is best played with five to six playes and it's fairly easy to pick up. It also comes with six handy reference cards to make learning the game even easier.The object of the game is to bluff your way to victory. In a far-flung future where the majority of the population is poor and oppressed, only a select few wield power and wealth. You will draw two cards which you will keep secret from your opponents and you will either use their actions or CLAIM you have other cards instead so you can use their actions. The catch? If someone else challenges you and you can't show you have the character to justify the action you just took, you lose influence. If you DO have the applicable character, the person challenging loses an influence. Losing an influence is defined as you turning over one of your cards face up, thus losing access to one action. If you lose all your influence, meaning both your cards are face up, you're exiled and you lose. Be the last man standing to win.The game consists of 15 character/action cards and a bag of money tokens, as well as the six reference cards cited earlier, making it simple to cart around. Coup was a big hit at my game night, with people liking it a lot or flat-out loving it. It's a great way to practice your poker face, because you'll need a good one to win.

  I purchased this game to try with my game group and family, and I was unsure what kind of results to expect.  Bluffing games are somewhat new to both of these groups, however I had heard great things about this game so wanted to try.  Unfortunately, it flopped on both fronts.  If you know you like bluffing games, as other reviews have stated then you will enjoy this game.  Both groups I tried it with found it a bit mundane, and the need to memorize the role cards to succeed made it challenging to play with people who are new to gaming or don't have time to play multiple rounds.  Overall, I think this game can work well for some people but make sure you consider how many times people will get to play it because I didn't think about the fact that it would be challenging to play with family members given the quality of being easy to learn.

  I knew I was going to love this game from the first time I saw it. First, I love the Resistance Universe and am a huge fan of The Resistance. I also really enjoy card games, fast and easy games, and games that involve guessing what others are going to do and when they are bluffing.The sci-fi premise, unique flavor, and simple but addictive gameplay keep you hungry for more, round after round. The cards feature gorgeous artwork, are well constructed, and look like they are going to last quite a while unless you treat them very roughly.As others have mentioned, it's important that people get into the spirit of the game. If they never pretend to have cards they don't and always play it straight people aren't going to have as much fun. And likewise, people who aren't good at keeping track of what other people are doing or are very shy may struggle here. On the flip-side, if you enjoy the people interaction and don't take things too seriously the game is a blast, and if you are a shy person and stretch a bit while playing it could actually help you become more comfortable acting like an extrovert etc.For the price this game is fantastic. I have no complaints but one wish. I sincerely hope there is an expansion at some point with more roles, because I think that could make the game even more fun, and I just can't get enough of the Resistance Universe.

  This game awesome!  I played with five other people (some of whom do not enjoy games) and everyone was entertained.  The directions are straight forward and easy to learn, all players understood what was going on before we had gotten to everyone's first turn.After each game ended, the players (ranging from teen to adult) were excited to start up another game (which is a rarity in my home).  We played for three hours before we knew it.  Some games last as little as five minutes, while other games lasted more than fifteen.Some people relied on bluffing to win, while other players won games without a single bluff.  There is a great deal of laughter when the revelation of a bluff comes to light.  Eliminated players usually enjoyed following along with the games and making their own predictions.  Eliminated players from games like Bang are usually done for the rest of the evening, as games can go on for hours, but this game is so short and simple a new round will be started before you know it (which doesn't ruin anyone's night).Coup is most certainly a must for anyone with even the slightest enjoyment for games, you and your fellow players will wonder why would didn't pick up this game sooner.

  Delightful game play with intrigue, bluffing, loose alliances and inevitable betrayal, all in 10 minutes or less per round.  This game was a quick favorite at parties with friends and family.  The rules are easily understood, and there are quick reference cards for those among us with short term (card game) memory issues.There are a couple of drawbacks, mostly to the production quality of the game. First, the instructions are littered with typos. Mind you, it does not detract from the meaning but there should have been better editing. Second, the card edges started to fray within two sessions (about 10-15 rounds per session). This is disappointing for me, since the art on the cards is stunning and I was hoping they would last longer.Even with the above issues, I still highly recommend buying this card game (and perhaps laminating the cards so they last longer). The art is excellent, the play is enthralling, and the time spent with friends/family is priceless.

Deception, hilarity, and pure fun -- Guaranteed!

  15 total cards across just 5 roles. Each player starts with two cards face down, much like Texas Holdem. Each turn you claim to be one of the 5 roles and take the associated action. Are you bluffing or trying to sell a double bluff? It doesn't end there. Many of the actions have counter-actions that can, in turn, be bluffed or double bluffed. Lie, deceive, fabricate, misrepresent, prevaricate, <insert synonym(s) here>. Then do it again and again. If you get caught lying, you lose one of your cards. If you incorrectly accuse someone of lying, you lose one of your cards. You can also lose a card via a coup or assassination. Once both cards are gone, you're out of the game. The last player standing is the winner.Coup is fast-paced, easily accessible, surprisingly replayable, full of player interaction and droll banter. It's a social, bluffing masterpiece!Pros:+ Very few games lead to more shouts of ""just one more!""+ Hones and rewards your ability to read your friends+ Proper observation requires lots of eye contact+ Hilarious banter guaranteed making it a perfect party game+ A rare social bluffing game that works with less than 5 players+ Easy to learn and accessible for all ages+ Great bang for your buckCons:- Won't be much fun if you're opposed to ever bluffing- Randomness is obviously a big part of the game- The endgame is often quite predictable

  This is a great hidden identity game. It is a bit complex in strategy but is certainly an enjoyable challenge once you get the hang of the rules and the people you play with. I would say that this is a game where you learn through failing a couple games first and catch on so be prepared for that. The packaging is quite nice and is small enough to viably carry around. It is not much bigger than a set for UNO. Despite having nothing to lock it, the box stays shut too. Great game for those who find strategy games a good challenge.

Cutthroat fun
","

  This is a fun game for 2 to 6 players. The players each get 2 cards, representing a character (ambassador, duke, captain, contessa, assassin etc). These cards are face down and each of them represents a life. When you lose a life you flip a card. When you lose your second life, you are out of the round.The great thing is that lying is possible (and encouraged :) ) and you can claim that your face down card is whatever you want. If you are not called on it, the action goes forward. If you are called on it and you were lying you are punished by losing a life. If however you did have the card you claimed when challenged, the challenger loses a life.The gamemoves quickly so those who get knocked out are not idle for long. It's short and sweet and you can beat the game by being honest if you want to and never lying to anyone. The game is totally worth the money.

  The tiles were not uniform and letters all over the place.  The board is defective.  I wrote a complaint to Hasbro and they claimed this product is no longer in production and wondered if I purchased from a third party.  With paying a premium price, I would expect it to be better quality.

Bring back the Scrabble Deluxe Edition Game (Amazon Exclusive)

  Absolutely hate this scrabble deluxe edition game.This scrabble is cheaply built, split away during games. Plus you have to lug around a big  box. Tell me Hasbro, this newer deluxe is far worst than the previous and how come you cant store the items inside the other Scrabble deluxe.  This Scrabble Deluxe is failure. Go back to the previous version.  I had purchased the Scrabble Deluxe Edition Game (Amazon Exclusive) in December , Amazon please bring back  Scrabble Deluxe Edition Game (Amazon Exclusive) which was better. You could store all everything inside the bottom of the game. And clean up was quick and easy.

  The playing surface is made of two pieces of molded plastic that connect with two pull-out plastic hinges.  When you turn the board so your opposing player can see the letters, the board comes apart all the time and you have to fix it.  The design defeats the purpose of buying this version of the game.  I would recommend purchasing another version with a lazy-Susan type of revolving mechanism.  The game itself is a classic, but this particular version of it is annoying to deal with.

Extremely cheap “deluxe” edition
","

  This was by no means a deluxe edition.  It is very cheaply made with an awkward method of connecting the two halves of the board.  The two halves were not even.  It‘s not a turntable like previous deluxe scrabble editions - the two halves of the board have wheels, instead.  Not a dealbreaker, but not smooth rotation.  The pieces were highly irregular as well, all different shapes and sizes, some patterns not printed in the center, and one piece was just straight-up broken.  Even the manual was poorly formatted and confusing.  I would feel slightly ripped off at paying $20 for this cheap plastic garbage, much less $40!  From what i can tell, all the Scrabble editions made by “Winning Solutions”, “Winning Moves” and “WS Games” are all very cheaply made and overpriced.  Returning it and ordering one of the earlier deluxe editions that were made 20-30 years ago.

TERRIBLE - no quality
","

  This is VERY poor quality - so bad that players can't really enjoy the game.  By no definition is this ""Deluxe"".  This is nothing like the classic products made and sold by Hasbro (or whatever company had it some years ago).  The price is completely unjustifiable.  The materials are all very cheap, and feel, sound and play that way.  Again, players just can't really enjoy the game, because of the distractions attributable to poor quality (such as the board always coming apart).Older versions are available and better, even if used.  You might find them on Amazon, or you can find them on other large auction sites.  If you require a new version, do your research and try to get a look at an opened product before you buy, even in a retail store.  There are older wooden versions, and other better-made plastic and cardboard versions.  If you want the true deluxe, you can find the 'Scrabble Deluxe Classic [or Wooden] Edition' here on Amazon and elsewhere.  It's much more expensive, but the quality is there.  If you want to spend about the same as this product costs, you'd do better to find a slightly used older version, including with wooden turntables and wooden trays and pieces, on an auction site (or maybe on Amazon).

  Not sure what I was expecting for the price, but I would not refer to this as ""deluxe"".  I already had a deluxe board and tiles, and was looking for a more transportable set. While the ridges on the board hold the tiles, the board itself is not a good quality nor are the tiles. there doesn't appear to be much quality control in printing and cutting the tiles.  The letters were not always the same color tone nor were the letters centered in the tile.  I gave it to a friend, as she has children that are learning to play the game.  It is not a set that will last a long time if used frequently.

Just fine
","

  I bought this after having only the classic Scrabble for a few years. I love Scrabble and wanted a nicer board to play when family comes over. They have a very nice board that sits on a lazy Susan and looks very nice.  I was hesitant about this particular model after hearing about it's quality, but the product I received is fine. The letters are all okay and none are broken like other reviews. The letters are also pretty center.  However, they are not as high quality as what another nicer more luxury set would offer.The board itself has a colorful design rather than the more elegant design of past deluxe sets.Overall it's not as nice as deluxe sets in the past. It's okay for the price point, but one day I would like to upgrade once again to a $100+ board when I can justify it.

Good but not great. Still worth buying.

   Pros: Not being on a lazy susan (turning table) but instead having angled wheels makes the game board lower to the table which I like. The raised borders work well and the letter pieces stay in place. The way the board hooks together in the center is easy.Cons: pressing the middle of the board makes it cave in a little. The fact it doesn’t snap together but lay in place is neither a good or bad design.  The cardboard box is the carrying case. Not a lasting design and kinda cheap. The wooden pieces aren’t all printed center and that bothers some people. I personally don’t care.Overall: I think it’s good for the price but not great. It’s built well enough for just home use but travel is iffy with a cardboard case. I’m satisfied with this purchase.

  The game itself is fine.  However, I bought it because the product listing said it came with a carrying case and my plan was to store the game in the carrying case aboard my sailboat for rainy day or evening fun in the cabin.  Once I received the game, I realized they just attached a handle to the top of the game box then called it a carrying case.  Had I known the case was just a cardboard box (which is not a good way to store things aboard a boat, for obvious reasons), I would not have bought this.

  This edition is in no way deluxe, the craftsmanship is incredibly poor. It's clear Hasbro really reduced quality in order to increase profits, the older versions of the game have much better tiles, a board that is more sturdy with an actual hinge and handle, and nice amenities like little drawers to hold your tiles and racks. Even the printing on the board is low-quality, with many smudges in the ink. Hasbro should be ashamed and embarrassed to sell something this low quality.

Flat Surface is Key!
","

  I personally never played Scrabble but have heard and seen it plenty of times. Played it with the family one day and less than a week later we have it ourselves and enjoy it everytime.Product is great and the box acts as a case to carry it where you need to. Wooden pieces feels light and sorta cheap but we are not that picky about it. Set up is truly quick and smooth. Simply pull the small hinges out from one side of the board and connect the other. It would be nice to have some type of lock with it so you wouldn’t have to keep it on a flat surface. We played on carpet and it still spun fine, just remember that my carpet/floor may be more leveled than your own. It did separate a few times from one hinge. Once you finish spinning the board just reconnect and continue. If we were on a flat surface then this wouldn’t be an issue. Board grids fit each piece slightly loose but I expect it to be like this.Overall, it’s worth the buy. Would recommend this to anyone. Price could be another factor but I feel this will last a very long time if taken cared of. Why the 4 stars? Cause if Hasbro could add locking hinges so it prevents or lessen the chances of separating during the game then it would be a well deserved 5 stars.

Hasbro please just sell us a round rotating board like tournaments

  Bought this on sale, would not have been happy at full price, but I’m fine with it on sale.As others have noted, the tiles are printed unevenly (how difficult could that be?), and the board sometimes comes apart during play if people aren’t gentle turning it - especially on my grooved wooden table. It’s hollow plastic so also rattley on such surfaces.What annoys me the most, however, is that Hasbro refuses to sell a *circular* game board like they use in tournaments, which is ideal. With a rotating square board (or worse, rectangular like this one, for reasons I don’t understand), people tend to move their tiles too close during play and they have to move them again for rotation.I would pay good money for one of those tournament boards, although I do understand they are impractical to store for most consumers.

Deluxe-o Oh No! Not entirely what you pay for.

  The letter tiles are made of wood; however, the tile holders are light, bendable plastic. These cheap-o tile holders are not depicted on the cover of the box which I later deemed deceptive.  Your letters can easily be knocked off the plastic rack due to the lack of weight.  There goes your game plan. For the money, I think the tile holders should be made out of wood as they used to be and as you might expect.  I would keep the game if wooden tile holder replacements were provided and I were allowed to simply throw the nasty plastic ones away without having to go to the PO to return them during this pandemic.

Major Disappointment

  I wish that, in my haste to get a turn table Scrabble board, I had taken the time to read these reviews. Doing so would have spared me considerable disappointment when I opened the Deluxe Scrabble and found just about the cheapest piece of manufacturing I have ever seen--especially at the price point. The tiles are featherweight, for starters, and drop off the table unnoticed (I can so attest). The red plastic trays are appalling. The font used on the design of the board looks like it's designed for the preteens, at best. And, finally, while it's true that the board does turn, it involves both hands to send on to the partner without clattering. I will give the board one star, but only because of past, now questioned, loyalty to the game itself. Awful.

","

  I have only played a couple of scenarios in the new Betrayal at Baldur's Gate, so you might take this review with a few grains of salt.First, I'll start with what I really like.The new characters all have a special power, like a spell, or ranged attack, or re-roll mechanic. This gives each character a bit more uniqueness and adds to the already high replayability factor.The D&D theme is well done in terms of the scenarios, events, flavor text, etc. I wasn't sure a thematic mashup of Betrayal and D&D would work, but so far, so good. Unfortunately, you can't read through the haunts without spoiling them, so I don't have enough data to know how well they fit the theme. However, in one play test, the haunt was all players versus the game. There was no traitor, and working together to beat the boss monster gave a familiar D&D feel.I like the way the buildings and streets combine to make a large ""ground level"" map, with a smaller catacombs level. I also like that each level has its own draw pile. In the original, a critical room can often be accidentally ""buried"" at the bottom of the draw pile because of the way the draw mechanic works. This does not occur in the new version.That said, one of my biggest complaints with the various Betrayal games (the original, Widow's Walk, and now this one) is that the scenarios do not appear to be play tested very well, if at all... or even well edited in some cases.How do I know?We almost always have questions about the traitor powers/actions... and not minor questions, but key issues with the way the powers are worded that make the haunt rules overly ambiguous.My wife and I are veteran gamers. We have played all the Betrayal games as well as other traitor-mechanic games like Shadows over Camelot, Battlestar Galactica, Dead of Winter, etc... The design challenge with the Betrayal games is that every scenario has slightly different mechanics for the traitor. Because of this, the game designers need to be extraordinarily detail-oriented when writing up the haunt rules.Due to the age of the original Betrayal, haunt clarifications can sometimes be found online, but not so for Widow's Walk or Baldur's Gate, so you are on your own to interpret the rules as written.For the hero group, the group can generally come to a consensus after discussion. However, the traitor is usually on their own to interpret any potential rule problems or vague wording, unless they want to give away their secret powers or win conditions.I have yet to play a haunt that hasn't had an issue where the text was not entirely clear and required some (varying) amount of interpretation. In almost every case, a single sentence (or two at most) could have cleared up the confusion. A good editor should have caught these ambiguities, but I have the distinct impression the the designers did their own editing... or if there was an editor, the editor was only looking for grammatical issues, and not in-play rules ambiguity. A play test of each haunt should haven eliminated most of these ambiguities.All games have some amount of rules ambiguity, but it is more pronounced in the Betrayal games simply because there are some 30 to 40 different haunts that all may have different issues, and you are not able to know the haunt rules in advance without spoiling the game.This has been a big problem for me in that any win or loss is tainted by the ""Hey, did we play that part correctly?"" discussion after the game. It often takes away some of the shine of a win, or adds to the frustration of a loss. I don't mind losing. Losing a competitive game can be lots of fun. But I hate losing when it later becomes clear that an incorrectly interpreted rule may have changed the whole scenario or player strategy.As a non-spoilery example, one of the haunts had a big monster with some smaller minions. The minions came out first, and the big boss a couple turns later. In the haunt, it appears to state that the minions go away once the boss monster comes out, but a sentence or two later, it implies the exact opposite. Also in the same haunt, the text appeared to imply that the boss monster may be able to attack more than one character given a certain condition, but it didn't explicitly state it. We rules that the minions stayed and continued to attack, but the boss monster did not attack more than once. That seemed to be the balanced interpretation, and we won the scenario... but we may not have one if the boss monster were allowed a second attack. So the victory felt diminished. Given that we had not just one, but two rules clarifications required for the haunt, I was a bit disappointed in that particular scenario.Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike the game. If you are a fan of the other Betrayal titles and you like D&D, you will almost certainly enjoy this mash up. However, my recent experiences with poorly worded haunts has tarnished what would otherwise be a really fun experience.I give it 3.5 stars. It will go up to 4 stars in the future if I encounter fewer haunts that have the same play test problems.

Very fresh take on the original.
","

  My boardgame group has loved my Betrayal at House on the Hill for years.  They welcomed the addition of Widows Walk.Then I introduced them to Betrayal at Baldur's Gate last night.Most of the mechanics from the original games work exactly the same.  There are some nuances that are different though.  Haunt rolls are changed so that now you roll dice equal to the number of omens revealed and once someone rolls a 6+ the haunt starts.Each character has special abilities now rather than just just being better in a certain stat.Rather than upper floor/ground level/basement the map progression is now buildings/street/catacombs.  This isn't as straightforward as it looks.  The doors are color coded to let you know what type of tile you are entering.  (Rather than 1 large pile of tiles you keep each type separate in this game)  Sewer gates/stairs go down into the catacombs.  This leads to a very interesting board layout as the street winds through buildings and the catacombs lay separate.Difficulty level seems slightly higher than the original, at least in the couple rounds we have already played.My only con to the game at this point is that some tiles feel like they are labeled incorrectly.  Buildings that feel like streets and vice versa.If you liked betrayal at house on the hill you will like this.9.5/10

Very fun, but flawed...
","

  There was lots of thought and design that went into this game - it's remarkable in some ways, but falls short in others.OVERVIEW: Betrayal at Baldur's Gate is a Dungeons and Dragons themed version of Betrayal at House on the Hill, with only 3 meaningful changes: 1. There's a minor tweak to the rules governing when the haunt is triggered, 2. The players' characters have built-in special abilities, 3. Instead of a three story house, you're playing in a two story city (streets&buildings on the base level, and underground catacombs below).STRUCTURE:Like the original Betrayal at House on the Hill - the game is really 50 games in 1. It's a semi-structured dungeon crawl game, where each player explores a map that will never be the same twice. You survive light encounters, find items, and attempt to boost your four attributes so you can face whatever challenges are revealed when one of the 50 potential haunt scenarios gets triggered.ACCESSIBILITY:The learning curve is slightly high - but new players can learn it quickly by playing with someone who understands all the rules. The rule book for the game is probably 20-30 pages.FLAWS:Three big ones: 1. The box does a poor job organizing all the pieces of the game, so the flow of the game is constantly getting snagged while you have to sift through lots of indistinguishable little cardboard tiles that correspond to unique events in the game, 2. The outcome of the game feels too driven by random chance, and not enough by the skill or strategy of the players, 3. Betrayal at Baldur's Gate is not compatible with Widow's Walk (the expansion to Betrayal at House on the Hill).TAKEAWAY:This game is a good fit for 3-6 players that want to engage in a highly imaginative, narrative-driven game (could also be played in 2player variant if each player uses two characters before the haunt triggers). There's high replay value because the map/characters/items/haunt scenario will never be identical. However, the flow of the game is fairly choppy, and the outcome of the challenges presented by the game are too skewed by chance rather than skill.If you like the idea of this game, original Betrayal at House on the Hill is probably the better investment, because you can add the Widow's Walk expansion. But if you like the Dungeons and Dragons theme and aren't terribly interested in getting an expansion, you should opt for Betrayal at Baldur's Gate

I broke the game. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who would do the same in my position.
","

  Played it for the first time during a weekend away with some friends. The setting we obtained (as there are multiple scenarios) was one of our party members had turned into the vessel for a goddess of water; the goal being stop her from flooding the mansion and subsequently the town. I had chosen a dwarf and had lost some intelligence from equipment obtained so I was unable to fulfill ANY of the tasks that would prevent this disaster. In true Leeroy fashion I opted for a different solution, which was to murder my wife by relentlessly pursuing her over the next 3 turns. I survived 3 life or death save rolls and was able to bring the monster to peace before anyone could even complete a single objective.This was a problem as we could not determine whether or not what I did was technically legal and if anyone really won the game, as the rule book states the demon uses the vessel as their method of navigating the game, but does not seem to anticipate anyone jumping the gun in the first 3 turns to fight something with ludicrous stats... and beating them each save. Without a vessel, the game was unable to proceed and no clear indications as to whether I broke the game out of sheer luck and ignorance.TLDR:I broke the game my first run through. Had a blast doing so, despite the hour long debate that followed with the implications about what a horrible person I was to murder my own wife instead of saving her. 10/10 would recommend to anyone who would do the same in my position.

If you like Betrayal and House on the Hill and you love Fantasy or Dungeons and Dragons or Forgotten Realms, this is a winner.
","

  This is a great spin on Betrayal at House on the Hill.  It is set in Dungeon and Dragons': Forgotten Realms city of Baldurs Gate with a horror twist.All of the original game's Haunts and Omens and Items and Events have either been twisted, re-worded or replaced by ones that fit a fantasy setting.The biggest difference is that you are exploring a city, not a a house.  So it is set up in ""2.5 layers"".  That is to say, before you had Main Floor, Upper Floor and Basement.  Now you have City, Buildings, and Catacombs.  So the way they connect is similar = door to door, but you keep three stacks of areas, and pull for a color coded door (instead of a lit window with text). This works fine with one exception - there are ""wide"" alleys that can connect to normal sized doors.  And well, that just looks odd... but it works.There are 2 or 3 less ""empty hallways"" in this game tile set, so most every room has an Event, Item, or Omen.The Omens are fun, some of then quite clever or creepy.  The items are very DnD, and typical of what you might find (including a humorous 10ft pole).  And the Events are brutal and rewarding and entertaining as in the original game.

Nice theme change and update for Betrayal.
","

  I will say I loved the original Betrayal at House on the Hill so this review is largely biased. I haven't played this a ton because my group played a lot of the original so we are on to different types of games but I will say the Fantasy theme suits this game very nicely.I will mostly talk about what is different from the Original + Expansion. There are only 2 levels instead of 4 (expansion adds 1) which I think is a positive change. Its much easier to fit the board on a table when there are fewer levels. I like that each character has its own ability along with the change of stats. It makes each character feel vastly different. The few haunts I've played have been really fun but its hard to compare haunts if you haven't played them all. The haunts have at least fit well with the theme so far.Note: Every betrayal game has HORRIBLE inserts. I almost feel its necessary to replace them with your own. I built my own for the original + expansion and I bought a wood one for this version. It vastly increases setup and ease of gameplay. If you buy the original + expansion it will not fit in the same box without removing the insert. I recommend trying the game and if you like it buy a new insert.Overall if you are trying to decide which betrayal to get I would probably recommend this one over the Original + Expansion for mechanics alone but I would go with the theme you think is most applicable. If you have a fantasy group get this one but if your group isn't as fantasy geared I would buy the original. The original theme is simply a haunted house which is familiar to everyone.

Great Game
","

  I love the original Betrayal at House on the Hill and I was a bit wary of this, thinking it would be the same game but with minor reskins. I really like this game though and they have made enough changes to make it feel different.1. Instead of building a haunted house, you are building a city. You have the street level where you have various alleys and streets, and you also have building that can become interconnected. The other level is the catacombs. You can drop through sewer grates to escape into the catacombs. Overall the map feels very different from the haunted house map and that is enjoyable.2. Each of the 6 characters have a special ability that they can use (like the Rogue can move through occupied areas without suffering movement penalties) and that gives each character a more unique gameplay.3. The theme feels different enough to not just be a reskinned version, as dungeons and dragons is a well established lore.All in all, get this game if you're a fan of Betrayal at House on the Hill, if you're a fan of Dungeons and Dragons, if you're a fan of both, or if you're just looking for a fun game to add to game night.

Not as good as the original

  This game is ok. It doesn’t have the fun factor of the original. There is something about this version that is less appealing. When we played this game at my game night not a single person really enjoyed it. We all decided that we will just keep playing Betrayal at House on the Hill instead. My friends play D&D so I was surprised no one was into it.I think that the idea of the game and the execution is good, it just wasn’t for me and my friend group.

Seriously cool game

  This game is awesome. Heavy-duty printed cardboard tokens and room tiles, and cool plastic cast character pieces, in the shapes of the characters themselves. Game play is about an hour, a little more depending. It's super fun, especially when the haunt begins!! 2 modes of game play, starting play, and the haunt, once it's revealed. One player (usually) turns traitor, as chosen by the game guide. There are 50 different haunt scenarios, so no two games are alike for at least 50 game plays! Need at least 3 players though to play. I bought Betrayal at the House on the Hill first, and loved it so much I bought Baldur's Gate, because I used to love playing Baldur's Gate on PC. Seriously, you need to buy both of these games. You won't be sorry!! Plus, they'll make more when they know they're popular!!

Great Next Game after Betrayal
","

  We loved betrayal and have played at least a dozen games with various people and seen a lot of the different haunts. Baldur's is made by the same company, and has very similar rules. Less horror scary, more mystery feeling. There are also a couple minor rule changes to help with Betrayal's weaknesses, but overall, it plays the same. We have no issues playing Baldur's one night, then Betrayal another as they are still different games with different haunts and such. I'd recommend buying both.

  The second I saw that there was a variation of Betrayal (one of mine and my wife's favorite games), we had to have it! I am SUCH a huge fan of the first one and we play D&D every week. Do you need to know anything about D&D to play this game, absolutely NOT! You can never have even heard of the D&D game before and this is STILL an amazing board game! Definitely one of the BEST BOARD GAMES! We learned it within 3 minutes of playing! Super easy to play! Hopefully they come out with even more variations. And for those of you that are D&D fans, why is bad stuff always happening to Balder's Gate? Like, at a certain point, you should move no? Seems like the worst possible city to live in the D&D cannon. It's like if you lived in New York in the MCU universe... just sayin'

  This is the perfect game to add to your collection if you are a fan of cooperative fantasy tabletop games.  Set in the Forgotten Realms (Dungeons and Dragons) city of Baldur's Gate, your party uses their special abilities to explore (build) the city while you investigate a growing evil.  Avalon Hill did a great job of capturing the ominous feel of their first Betrayal game and infusing it into a new world of possibilities.  Many of your favorite D&D villains and traps are just one unlucky dice roll away.  A few minor changes were made to the original game's rules that have made this version play more smoothly than it's forerunner.  The marriage of survival horror and fantasy roleplaying is flawless.I took ""Betrayal at Baldur's Gate"" to a game night with my Dungeons and Dragons group last week and it was a HUGE hit!In the end, it was I who had conspired to lead my hapless group of friends to Baldur's Gate...and I killed them all.............

  Let me preface this by saying that I play/own the original Betrayal and the Widow's Walk expansion and absolutely enjoy them.The quality of the board pieces and tokens is still fairly solid. The sliders for the character cards seem to fit much better than the ones we have for the original Betrayal. Some of the Haunts are still written in a mildly ambiguous manner, but we worked through those issues as a group and house ruled them.  All in all, I'm giving the game a 4/5 because it still needs work in clearly writing out the haunts.

For those of you familiar with House on the Hill, it's exactly what you would expect- the same game, but with more of a heroic fantasy feel, and with the odds stacked a little more in favour of the heroes than the traitor, at least from the three times I've played it so far.

  I actually think it is better than the original betrayal but that might be my love of Baldur's Gate causing a bias coming through. Everything from events to items and locations have been changed and now the characters have abilities and none of them are ""crappy."" All of the abilities are useful in certain situations.

  A fantastic fantasy/D&D variation on Betrayal at House on the Hill. Many new ideas, such as the unique character abilities, add some refreshing flavor. Story-immersive, quick to learn, and every round you play is totally unique. Great to have this as part of my game collection!

Baldur's is Worth Gettting Even if You Already Own House
","

  Great game. Ironically, a group of friends and I played it the other night for the first time instead of our weekly Pathfinder game. We ended up with the haunt in which your character is actually a DM running a D&D game! Hilarious!This game is very similar but so much different than Betrayal at House on the Hill. Baldur's has enough elements that it feels like a Fantasy RPG, while House feels like a classic Horror game.

  The game is well thought out, and a brilliant sequel to Betrayal at House on the Hill. Maybe if there were little baggies or more compartments to organize all of the different pieces so I can spend less time digging through the chips, or sorting at the beginning of the game, that would be good. For anyone who has never played before, be ready to spend hours playing the game. Also plan on playing with people who are ready to pay attention because there can be a lot to keep track of.

Fun, just consider buying more markers ahead of time
","

  This game is a lot of fun, it's a great party game that helps people get acquainted or you can tease your long time friends with. It's fun for 2, maybe 3 rounds a night but realistically that's a decent amount of time if you're not comparing yourself to the serious board game people. I first played it a year and a half ago and someone had said that it's a ""great game but you could easily make it yourself"" I brushed this off because it's true of a lot of board games, where the maker of the game  shoe horns in unnecessary items like a timer, board or buzzer to make it a more complete package (even though these things have no effect on the fun of the game or could easily be replaced with an app) Anyways I brushed this off, I didn't want to take the time to make my own white board rolladex and recreating the experience with spiral notebooks, pens and a word generating app would feel too cheap. My problem is that out of the box two markers didn't work, and sharing markers really slows down the game, I felt throwing in an extra couple markers to make up for drunken misplacing or them being DOA would have made up for the $30 price point. Again this game is fun, it's low stakes, quick game that's a great icebreaker. I highly recommend picking this up, just consider buying extra dry-erase markers (maybe with finer points)

Didn't Enjoy This Game
","

  We love playing games at our house and enjoy a pretty wide variety of game types. I saw this game and bought it based on the good reviews. I had expected it to be similar to ""Win, Lose, or Draw,"" a game I used to enjoy playing in the past. Unfortunately, this game was not nearly as fun, and really more of a dud for us and our guests. It doesn't initiate any communication/interaction between players, except at the very end when each person goes through and explains their boards. No one really seemed to enjoy it and passing the boards around got old quickly. The game can also get back-logged easily, while some players wait for others to finish drawing. We didn't like any of the proposed scoring methods, so we opted not to keep score. All and all, the game is okay, but needs something to make it more engaging and fun to play. I'd recommend watching a YouTube video of gameplay before deciding whether or not it's something you'd enjoy.

  I bought this game for Christmas and it was a huge hit! No fighting! No winners or losers, just rip roaring fun! The more players, the more fun! Our group was made up of 7-8 people ranging from ages 10 - 80 and even the teenagers liked it! The more sarcastic or snarky their guesses, the more fun for everyone!  We are not a raucous group, but at times we were crying we were laughing so hard from silly pictures and guesses in this game. If you have a competitive family and often have individuals leave or quit because someone is ""cheating"" or thinks it's ""not fair"" then this is the game for you! Because each turn builds off the person to your right, there is no pressure, no competition, and no down side. The worse you can draw, the better it gets! Play a round or two if you don't have much time, or go round and round for hours!! The only complaint I would make is that the 10 year old didn't always understand the word she got, but even so, she could pick another card. My niece brought it to her friends house to play and the fun continued on and on....

Fun for the whole family.
","

  I purchased this after playing it with several co-workers. It's honestly a great game that works well with a wide variety of people. The instructions are fairly easy and the fun is looking to see how people interpret your original drawing. It's best played with a large group of people, as the more drawings and interpretations you have, the wilder and crazier the guesses can get. You can play it with less, although it can sometimes be hard to keep up depending on the crowd (and amount of drinks). It's also easy to get people excited in the game - I played this while on vacation with my boyfriend's family. I only had about six people playing the first night, but we had so much fun that people came over to watch and during the second night we had eight. We had a child playing with us that was about seven years old and although we had to help him with spelling, he absolutely loved playing because it's something he can play with adults that isn't an out and out kid's game.My only quibble with the game has to be with its point system - it seems to be fairly complicated, enough so that I've never bothered to use it nor have others that I've played with. It's much more fun to just pass around the books and compare everything once it's done. The pads and pens are OK - one of my pens was dry when I received it, but that's kind of par for the course with anything that comes with markers and has the potential to sit around for months in a warehouse. You can use most dry erase markers with this, so it's easy to replace.

  This is one of those games that I frankly couldn't understand what the big deal was the first time I was set to play it.  I have played many party games over the course of many years and I'm generally not a fan of the ""drawing"" games, so I was prepared to just grin and bear it.By the time I was done with my first game, I was crying from laughing so hard.  This is a great ""we're laughing with you"" experience.  Sure, winning is great, but honestly, everybody is a winner in this game because it's just so darn entertaining.  This is a wonderful game for getting people to let their guard down a bit, and if you have kids that are focused on whether or not they are winning or losing, this is a game that will help them see you can just have fun.  And yes, kids love this game. It is as kid-friendly as the group of players is.I can describe this as the old children's game ""Telephone"", with a drawing twist.  But that is a serious undersell.  It doesn't sound like it would be that entertaining, but trust me it is!This is sold in 6, 8 and 12 player editions.  I would suggest that you decide which one to get the same way you buy a tent.  Get it a little bigger than you think you need it.  Once it becomes known in your playing circle, you will have no problem getting everyone to play.

So much fun!!!
","

  This game is so much fun! It's a combination of the old telephone game and pictionary. Each player has a dry erase marker and pad and every round a word or phrase is picked from a card drawn. You then sketch the word/phrase and pass the pad to the next player. They in turn guess what is drawn. After guessing the pad is passed again and the next player has to draw what was guessed. This continues until the pad arrives back at the original owner. At that point you go through the sequence from the beginning to the end. It is amazing how the word/phrase changes as it makes it's rounds. Wonderful belly laughs for all. This is a great family game and can be played by all age groups.

I will definitely recommend buying this game because it lightens up the environment and provides a quality laughter time with your friends and family. Also, for any small team event, I would consider adding this game as an ice breaking game.The game comes with all the necessary items that you need to play the game with, and even if you run out of any of of the items, you can purchase it easily from a departmental store, such as markers, sand timer, dice, etc.I use a marker cleaner instead of the cleaning cloth provided for keeping the dry-erase surface clean and in-tact. I plan on using the cards from other games such as taboo to incorporate variety in words, once we play this game plenty of times to be able to guess the card words. Also, I noticed that they have a ""after the dark"" edition as well, which should be fun too!! Have lots of fun playing this game!!

One of the most fun games I've ever played despite some quality issues
","

  This will leave you in tears of laughter. It's the best game to come along in I don't know how long. Play is simple, and no matter how good or poor an artist players are, if they can scribble on paper, practically anyone in your group can get involved regardless of age. It is appropriate for all ages in that it is clean, but the very youngest children will probably not often  understand the word or phrase they will have to draw if you're thinking of including them. I think children as young as 8 are able to play without it being too challenging; if they get a word they don't understand, tell them to choose one of the words the know. There are some issues with the low quality dry erase markers and the tiny microfiber cloths each person receives to wipe their book clean. If you leave the cap off too long, say during one complete round of play, the marker tip dries up a bit and won't draw. I made the mistake of putting the cap on and giving it a couple of shakes only to have virtually all the ink become deposited in the cap, making a terrible black, inky mess that resulted in throwing out the pen. You'd think they could include higher quality marking pens for what the game costs. Go ahead and purchase some decent quality dry erase markers to keep with your game and throw the original ones out. Don't bother using the tiny cleaning cloths. They will quickly become covered in dried marker residue and not be very effective. Have a box of plain tissue on hand instead. Make sure all the pages in each booklet are erased before putting the game away or the marks will be very difficult to remove and leave behind a faint stain. We only use the timer if there is anyone being a meticulous artist and repeatedly holding up game play. If all the contents of the box were better quality, I would have rated it better for value, but as it stands, the game only gets its material value from the cards and booklets. I still highly recommend this game, though, because it is hilariously fun to play!

An Awesome Twist on the Telephone Game
","

  Telestrations is so much fun - the bigger the group the better. This game works best when you have 8 or close to 8 players, just because of how the rotation is set up. The game consists of 8 dry-erase drawing tablets and markers, and a set of double-sided playing cards. Each player chooses a card so that they know what word or phrase they are starting with. You draw the item, then pass your tablet to the next person. They guess what you drew, then pass it on. They draw the guess, then pass it on. And so forth until it gets back to you, and you can see how far from your original word that the guesses traveled. This isn't set up as a competition game, but rather a cooperative game. So there isn't a winner, but it is an absolute blast to play. We played with ages ranging from 8 years old to 72, and everyone loved it. It's a nice break from fierce competition on game night, and a fun way to spend time with family.

  One of the best party games out there, especially if you have a ""darker"" or more adult mindset, though that's not at all necessary to find the laughs and fun in this game. The only complaint is that the markers wear out somewhat fast and are a bit too thick, creating sloppy artwork and making any sort of small detail-work overly difficult, which is unnecessary in a timed situation, which is how this game is played anyway. I keep having to buy dry erase markers from the 99Cents Store to replace the ones in this box.

Fun for the whole family (including teens and young adults)

  We learned about this game from cousins - huge game nights with a range of kids through 20-somethings. Everyone is laughing. For some, puzzling out it more fun than the drawing, but it's great to see all the varieties of thought. We got this and immediately played it out of the box - two families - adults and teens. Everyone gets a card and according to a die roll you get an assigned word or term. Depending on the number of players you either illustrate that term, or pass it one. You continue passing the booklets around only looking at the last drawing or guess at the term before you take a guess or draw from the previous guessed term. This is the game ""telephone"" but done in drawings and guesses at the drawings. Once your little book makes it around back to you, each person shares what happened with their word. It's exciting when the group stays close to the term, like ""playground"" and funny when it goes way off track...""bat cave"" to Halloween.

  Tons of fun. This game is easy to learn and produces endless laughs. It can be played with formal scoring, or just draw pics and have fun. That's what we did. Everyone loved it.You're given a word. Draw a picture to describe the word. Pass the tablet to the next person. They have to guess the word based only on what was drawn. They write that word and pass it to the next person who has to draw that word, and so on. By the time it goes around the table, you'll be on the floor laughing at how far off the guesses and pictures have become and seeing where things went horribly wrong. Easy and fun. Booklet pages are whiteboard coated for use over and over. Comes with markers. I'd recommend cleaning with whiteboard cleaner before they go back in the box so they don't stain.

  If  Pictionary had a baby with the telephone game, you get Telestrations. No drawing skills necessary. Using dry erase markers  levels the playing field for both artists and non-artists alike. The box says for age 12 and up, but if you can read you can definitely play this game. My 7 and 10yr olds love playing this game.You will definitely want to use the wipe cloths provided to clean the books every time, otherwise the piles from your fingers will ruin the markers. We learned that one the hard way. And if you forget to wipe out the whole book baby wipes work just fine, just make sure the pages are dry before writing on them.This is, now, one of my family’s favorite games. It makes us laugh so hard that our belly hurts afterwards.

  I saw this game when a friend posted a picture on instagram playing it. I was immediately intrigued and came to Amazon to read reviews and promptly knew I needed this game. We have so much fun playing this game! We all laugh so much we are in pain every time we play it.  I definitely recommend getting the 8 player version. In most stores you can only buy 6 player but the extra couple players can really make a difference with the end result. My entire family enjoys this game so much I keep it in my car so that we can play it wherever we are. I even have several friends that have bought the game since I got it, and it is often a requested game to play. My 9 year old niece loves to play it so it is also a good game for kids, as long as they can read and have basic understanding of what things are. I only have two slight complaints. 1. The markers quickly dried out and I had to buy new ones. 2. The lamination on the books is not the best quality and is peeling a little. That being said I still absolutely love the game!

It's great for all ages, we had kids from six years of age to adults 70 years of age. Its super easy to play and not a lot of thinking involved. There's no score keeping (unless you want to) no beginning or stop time so you can play one round or 10. The more people the funnier it becomes. Think telephone and Pictionary all in one.

  I wish I bought the 12 person version of this game, but it was released after I bought the 8 person. The best part of the game is at the end of the round going through all the pictures and guesses and making fun of your friends and family for their poor guessing and drawing skills. I do find that when mixed with alcohol people can have a REALLY hard time following the process. I find myself having to constantly direct people on what to do. Like ""Flip the page, pass the book, read the words, now draw"" etc. But that isnt the fault of the game, its my brain dead family of drunks that cant follow along.

My mom had a stroke and is cognitively disabled, but she is able to play this game with us since it is so straight forward.This spiral-bound pads in this particular box were a little wonky. The holes for the spiral were punched with too much of a margin. There was too much of the paper inside the spiral so it was impossible to flip the pages.

  This is a super fun game, and a perfect one to play when you are to ""shelter in place."" This is a very easy game to learn: directions are printed on the whiteboard booklets that are passed out to each player. Because this is based on Telephone, booklets are passed around as each player tries to guess the drawing. Laughs abound when the  original booklet is passed back to the original player. The only downside is that the markers do not last all that long, so plan on having extra white board markers in your cupboard.

  This is a great game for a bunch of friends just wanting to sit back and be silly. If you've never played it, it's a graphical take on the old ""telephone"" game where you whisper a phrase to the person next to you and they pass it down the line, then you compare what the first person said to what the last person heard. In this case, you're drawing the word or phrase and the next person has to guess and then the next person has to draw what they guessed, so on down the line. The results can be absolutely hilarious. The dry erase markers are a bit cheap but it's not hard to find replacement markers at the local drug store. Also, one of my books was put together in the wrong order which made it confusing the first time we played it.

Great family game!  Everyone loves it.

  This is such a wonderful game for family game night we've played with kids as young as 7 and adults as old as 75.  Easy to learn, but we changed the rules a bit- we allow players to chose any phrase or word on their chosen card to illustrate.  We also never keep score- It's so much fun to walk through the various illustrations and laugh, by the time we've shared everyone's, no one cares what a score might be.  (Eliminates so much bickering as well!) EIther way you play this game is a hit.

  Recommended to me. I ordered it with fingers crossed; Game Day was two days away! It arrived as everyone arrived.

  I originally played the game with my sons family over the holidays.  They received it as a gift.  We played with ages between 72 and 7 years.  Other than being lenient with the timer, with the younger ones involved, we found it easy to play and a lot of fun for all of us.  I bought one as a gift shortly after I played and now bought one for my own household for when we have family or company over.  It is a good icebreaker and does not take a lot of talent to do the drawings.

Hilarious game for the whole family!
","

  The rules are simple so it's easy to get playing right away. The first time we played with 8 people aged 10 to 66 and we laughed so hard our faces ached after. We played again with a group of 8 aged 5 to 45 and it was a bit tough for the 5 year old but everyone still had a blast. I absolutely love the game. We tried it with a group of 4 tonight and laughed to tears. We only used the timer one round and I don't think it's necessary unless you have someone you're always needing to wait for. Wonderful concept, easy and super fun to play.To play, each person has a little spiral book with whiteboard like pages. Everyone draws one card that has a word like ""castle"" or a simple concept.  With an even number of players, each person draws their word and passes it to the next person who then writes their guess of what the picture represents, and that continues until it gets back to the original owner.What makes this game extra special to me is everyone does something every round. You get to actively participate the whole time. Also awful drawers aren't really a drawback because their awful attempts add a whole new level of hilarity. We found this a great family game and look forward to playing again!Wishes: I wish I'd gotten the party pack so I had 12 pads. I'd like more cards. I felt like we repeated them too quickly. I'd happily buy card or pad expansions.

  If you are looking for a huge amount of laughter and fun with your friends and family.......this is the game! I was introduced to this game by friends and our mouths hurt from laughing and smiling so much. What a great concept executed nicely in this board game. After buying it my family and I have lured several friends over with offers of dinner and a “board game”. They have all arrived hungry but not real jazzed about a board game. They have all walked out of here exclaiming this is the most fun they’ve had in quite some time! There are two versions. The other one is the ADULT version and comes in a black box. My review is for the family version. Read the description carefully and make sure you are getting the correct one. Have a blast!

A great twist on Pictionary and the Telephone game
","

  A great twist on Pictionary and the Telephone game.  My artistic ability is nil but it's still fun to see what others draw and guess.  The markers are very cheap.  Two of the markers were dried out when we opened the box for the first time.  The tips of the markers are very thick for the small size of the drawing books.  We use small dry erase markers we have around the house.  The booklets get ""stained"" easily, too.  After each time we play, we take wet paper towels and clean the pages.  Do not use windex because it will ruin the pages!  My friend did that with her game and now one of her pages she has paper taped to it and they just change out the paper each round.  The little eraser cloths get filled up quickly and it's hard to erase everything on the page.

Extremely fun party game that's all about having fun and not really about scoring points or winning
","

  After my friends introduced me to this game, I just had to get it. Every time I've played it, it has really not been about winning or scoring points (although you could easily do that). As a matter of fact, the worse people draw and/or guess, the more fun this game becomes. It really does become a challenge to see if your word can make it all the way around.It's a great party game and for that reason I would recommend you get an 8 player version or higher. The more people, the more fun the game.The game itself is well designed and arrived in good shape. The only negative for me was that it came with 7 good dry-erase markers and 1 that was missing a cap and was dried out. The cap was not in the box either so it must have been a manufacturing mistake. I did not return the game or complain about this because I have plenty of dry erase markers at home.

Great game but markers don't work
","

  We bought this game to bring on vacation.  We played a few times with 7 adults and found it to be great fun.  Unfortunately, the dry erase markers that came with the game do not work well.  The game comes with 8 markers.Two didn't work from the beginning, and one stopped working soon after.  This put a damper on our fun, as sharing markers really delays the game.  I would suggest that if you buy this game, consider buying a multipack of black dry erase markers at the same time, which will, unfortunately, increase the cost of the game.  So, while the game is fun, it ends up being more expensive than it seems.  It's too bad the manufacturer hasn't supplied a reliable product.

Very fun for all ages, the more players the better

  Our family loves this, for all ages, even if you can't draw (even better if you can't, as it's more fun that way!).  The 8 player version came with pens that the tops didn't fit on the ends of the pens, that was not good, so we bought some different DRY ERASE pens that were better.  We also have the 12 player version and those pens were right.  You will want to get some dry erase cleaner to clean the cards after playing a few times - as you use a cloth to erase after each round, and like all dry erase things they don't come completely clean (until you use a cleaner).  The cloth cleaners that come with the game are too small for serious players too – so get some better erasers at school or office supply store and you will enjoy the game more.So what are you paying for? Cards to write on, and a deck of cards that will give you works to draw, a board, dice, etc., and a lot of fun – trust me, it’s worth it (shop the sales, online, and you can get this game for a good deal)

  I play this with my daughter and 2 grandchildren and we all love it.  We don't bother keeping score because we're having too much fun to care.  And forget about the 12+ age suggestion.  My granddaughter is 7-1/2 and my grandson is almost 11.  Some of words/phrases are beyond the kids, so we just let them pick any selection on the card, whereas the rules say to throw the dice and pick the choice that corresponds to that number.  You can save that rule for the 12+ group.

  What can be said that already hasn't.  A very simple game in theory, you draw a picture on a small whiteboard, pass that picture to a neighbor who guesses what the picture is and passes the answer to the next neighbor who draws the answer provided.  So if the person started by drawing a violin and it goes through a series of drawings and guesses you hope the last drawing is a violin, but it will probably be a rocket ship or a giraffe or something.  No real points or winner in this game, more of a social game to get a group of people talking and having fun.  Great for parties and families.  My family loves playing this game together.

  The classic Elementary school game, Telephone, meets Pictionary and SO much fun ensues. The game is easy enough for any sized group and it is so much fun to go back on the cards and see where things went awry. It's not appropriate for children just because some of the cards you draw are a bit more advanced and sometimes more adult, but I'm sure that kids could play if a parent filtered through the draw cards first. Definitely a must have for game night!

  Just as the reviews we read said!  Brings out the craziness of even the stiffest holiday guest!  All ages over 5 (unless you have a little Einstein in your midst) seemed to have the same connection to the game.  It was a little confusing to sort out at first, and we all read and reread the directions a second time with the equipment all distributed in front of us to help catch on to the rules easier.  We all thought it would have been a little easier to use if the markers were not quite so fat and a lot thinner at their tips.  This would also create a much smaller mess to clean up after each game.  This is a wonderful game to allow children and adults to play together and be equally fulfilled and happy.

  This game is great.  It's quick to play a round and people can drop in or leave in between rounds without issue so it makes a great mixer game.  It's great that the worse  you (and/or your guests) are at drawing, the more fun you'll have.  Other games are too dependent on scoring points as a result of passable artistic skills.  This is more like ""Who's line is it anyway"" (can I reference that on Amazon?) where the points don't matter.  It can, in fact, be more fun to lose spectacularly.

  I have found this obviously works best with a minimum of 5 and the more the merrier.  Kids as young as 7 can pick it up but spelling out their guess is the hardest part for them.

  The game is really fun! We played it with a bunch of adults and had a blast. Then played with our family of four. Not as much fun as with eight players (it goes really fast). I then played it with a friend and our combine five daughters who are grades 5 through High School and it was fun. We bent the rules a little and let the girls pick any word off of the list rather than rolling the dice and making them draw the corresponding number. The kids loved it!Super bummed that only 2 of the 8 pens worked!! We had to share pens the first time we played (which sucks the fun out) and then I bought wipe board markers for the next game.

  This has to be one of my favorite games to date.  We played with family a few nights ago, and before the night was over I had already ordered from Amazon so I would have my own copy of the game.  Think TELEPHONE and how quickly things can get off base when passing a whisper from person to person, and then add the fact that its not a whisper, but a guess on a drawing or a rendition of the previous person's guess.  When you get all the way around you have 4 drawings and 4 guesses of what your drawing and word was, and it can be darn funny.  We laughed until we cried many many times the night we played.I highly recommend this game!

Hilarious, Phenomenal Family / Party Game

  The game concept is simple: Write down a word or phrase. Draw that word or phrase. Pass the drawing to the next player, who writes down a guess. Pass that guess to the next person, who draws THAT word or phrase. Repeat four times. You score points for the best drawing, the best guess, and if the correct word or phrase survives four rounds (eight players) worth of ""telephone."" This game came highly recommended, and I picked it up for Thanksgiving with the family. We laughed until we cried. Absolutely hilarious! Some of the phrases on the cards just beg for a disaster, and others are categories, blanks (make up your own starting word!), and the like. I cannot recommend this game highly enough, not only because it's good for all ages and easy to play, but because it self-adjusts to the crowd. Lots of little kids? Lots of stick figures and cute times. Lots of adults drinking around the table? Lots of really, really hilarious and (if your family is like mine) borderline-inappropriate cartoons. All in all, a wonderful product, well-packaged and well-executed. Everything is dry-erase, so set-up and tear-down is a snap. More copies of this are being purchased as we speak, and we will definitely be providing it as a gift for a few people this holiday season. Five stars across the board for hilarious family fun.

Some fundamental changes in this version
","

  Some fundamental changes in this version that I don’t like. They added an Event deck in an effort to mix things up which I appreciate in theory but every card in it is a “take that” card that makes you take money from other players.  This is a big change from the earlier versions of the game where you played against the game and your budget with no real “take that”.  For playing with younger players that allows for a semi-cooperative experience and is much less aggressive than this new version. They also did away with Savings accounts and its interest and only have Loans now which I didn’t care for as not having that removes a good opportunity to teach kids about saving vs spending in their budget. I returned this version and am keeping my older copy.  It’s a good attempt at refreshing the game but is not for me.

  Awesome game to help kids/teens learn about finances and unexpected costs. Also shows them ways to make money. Simple to play for young children 7 ish plus, but has enough details to keep up with a teen.Every child should play this game to get familiar with how to handle money properly. It's not an end all be all cure to teach children about money, but is a great tool to teach them financial strategies. :)Personal Experience:My 7 and 8 year old love the game and beg to play. My 5 year old plays and we help him along. He likes it too.My 7 and 8 year old could easily be banker. The first time we played the 7 and 8 year old ended up broke and both cried. We paused the game, and explained that this is how some people live...they just don't have enough money to pay all their bills. We (my husband and I) said to them that money and bills are not as easy as we (mom and dad) make it look in real life. We advised them to look for money making opportunities and play it out to the end. They did, and now both enjoy the game now that they know how to be more responsible with money.My 7 and 8 year old have even brought up about spending money in real life situations now. That makes me feel like I did something right.This game was a really good investment.

  Ok, so when I was a kid I remember playing Payday. So when my kids decided that we needed to add Payday to the pile I was ok with that. The game arrived quickly and was good... it just wasn't the game I remembered. The cute little quirky mail cards used to include little postcards and fun things - but in this version those cute little quirky things are replaced with markup cards that are really no good for anything until you sell an item. They are really minor complaints, and the kids don't care. But if you are a fan of the old game this one might be a bit of a let down.

  Played this with my mom tonight. I had watched a video of how to play beforehand, and I have played the video game so I had a pretty good idea of how it would go. Still, I thought it would be a lot harder to explain to my mom who hasn't had any experience with the game or area control games than it turned out to be. We had no problems figuring out how to play, the game loop is very fun, well written rules and the few problems we did have were easily found right away in the rules. The artwork is exactly what you would expect, functional and does the job just like the video game. High quality parts and some nice little details like the ""death"" dice has little red blood splatters on it. We both had so much fun and I can't wait to play it again with more people! I have a feeling this is going to end up as a top favorite for me on game nights. :) 10/10

  LOVE this game!  My husband and I play the ipad version so we were curious to find out they had a board game.  We have played the board game now quite a few time with just us two and a few times with friends, once you learn the rules the game is a blast!  Our first game took about 3 hours, while we read the instructions and figured out what was what, but after the first game we were able to play each additional game within 1 hour and 30 minutes.  It is so much fun!

  Just played session 1, 3 players. Took about an hour. None of us knew how to play but it took us 1 turn to get it, set it up, follow the instructions step by step once and you are good.The game is awesome! You get to steal countries from other players, very cut throat, the simple play makes it go fast that I didnt even notice the play time as it went by. The companion app is nice too, with a leader board for those competitive types (ME!), The ambient music is just the video game sound track, there is a die roller, which is rather pointless. And lastly a random disease name generator! That is truly fun!

  Our family loves playing board games. I bought this to take to my sister's house and we played a round. The directions are a little bit hard to follow, but we figured it out by playing the game step by step with the instructions and then played a round without them. It was just as fun as the video game! We all loved it. You definitely need more than 2 people though to play or else it really doesn't last long. We will be bringing this to all the family gatherings for sure!

  It may not be as fun during the current CORVID19 outbreak, but in general - it's fun. The quality is good, the rules are clear and simple. Can be played for up to 4 players, or singleplayer (which is very unusual for the board games). I played this game on PC and spent good time. The board adaptation is as good as the PC original.

If you like Pandemic?
","

  This is a really fun game unlike Pandemic the players play against each other. It's nice to work with everyone in curing a disease, but sometimes it's more fun to win by eliminating everyone else. In fact, once one player can't play anymore the game stops. If you see you have and advantage and can knock out a player earlier then you can do that. There are a lot of different ways and variations in playing Plague. The material is solidly built and should last a long time.

  I had played the classic version years ago, but with young kids complicated board games are a little off the table for now. This version was great for me and my big two (6 years and 8 years). They picked it up quickly - the 8 year old won the first game even against both parents. There's still enough strategy to make it interesting but the winner is mostly the one who draws the right cards at the right time.I know some young kids are ready for the full version early, (and great for them!) but for our household with 4 young kids, we just don't have the time and focus to devote to a long and complicated game. 20 minutes and simple gameplay is about all we can handle before the toddlers tear the house apart.I would say if the YOUNGEST in the house is focused and able to handle longer games, just get the classic version and adapt for them. But in our situation this one is the winner for the next few years.

5 year old LOVES it, as do mom and dad
","

  My wife and I started playing full Ticket to Ride years ago on XBox and the iPad.  I've been excited to get this for my oldest son since I first saw it.  Does not disappoint!Simplifies the game greatly (i.e. no points on ticket cards), and my 5 year old is already learning some beginners geography and strategy.  It's still advanced enough that my wife and I genuinely love playing it (especially compared to boring Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, etc...).I'd even recommend this over the full version for most people.  While we haven't played the full Ticket to Ride besides using XBox/iPad, I can imagine the process of keeping score without the assistance of the computer would be annoying.  This doesn't have any points concept at all, likely making it a much more laid back experience.

You Want This Game!
","

  Let me start out by saying that we are huge fans of the original Ticket to Ride. My husband and I play all the time but our 6 year old wasn't quite ready. I had been going back and forth on the kid version for a while but decided to try it. I am so glad we did. It is so much fun! It is the same idea as the original but the game play is much easier to accommodate the kids. We play with our oldest often and us parents are having just as much fun. For newbies to Ticket to Ride, it's a game where you collect train routes and the first person to complete 6 routes wins. It is a blast! This game is a great intro to strategy without being overly competitive or confusing. I highly recommend to kids even as young as 5.

Quality All Across the Board
","

  This game is excellent.  Where to begin.Just picking up the box you can tell the quality.  It is HEAVY!  The components in this game are great.  The construction of the board is one of the best I have ever seen.  It is thick, has sturdy folds, large (easy for people to crowd around), and has some nice visuals which are important for children to use if they cannot read yet so trying to complete a ticket is able to be done by a younger child.  The plastic train pieces are detailed, and the game comes with extras just in case (with kids you are bound to lose some.....possibly even to them playing with the nice pieces outside of using them for the game because they are that nice) and each color comes with its own zip-lock baggie.  The card are thick, appealing, and high quality with a nice sheen, and the organizer in the box fits everything perfectly.The game play is simple yet competitive, where you need to strategize and possibly try to block your opponents ability to create a route to complete tickets (the objective of the game) if you can figure out their goals.  This game can be played on so many levels, even as a quick game with adults (if you want to have more competition, you can play with a modified rule set which is awesome.  You can basically use the ""express"" version rules to increase difficulty so the game can grow with the children's ability to provide years of entertainment!)  Younger children can even play it and be competitive against adults as well because the game has an intuitive rule set.This game is a win on so many different levels that I wish other games were made and designed as well as this.

Fun for kids, directions are a bit complicated
","

  I bought this for my 8 year old nephew.  He has been playing it with his 6 year old brother and his parents.  The directions were not that easy for them to follow, and they have made up their own directions to simplify it for the kids, so when I tried to play following the actual directions it was a bit complicated and led to some misunderstandings.Anyway, I am sure this is a fun game for kids, but maybe it could have simpler game play and directions, especially if the age range is 6 plus.

  This is a decent game for kids. My kid learned to play it at age four but has gotten better at understanding the rules and strategies now at five. However, like the original Ticket to Ride, it still involves having a lot of cards in hand, which can be hard for little ones. Also, the game is supposed to use pictures and words to help them keep track of their routes but the pictures on the cards don't always match the pictures on the gameboard. I think this is a overlook on part of the game designer. We buy a lot of games, and honestly this one doesn't hit the table as often as others.

  I bought this game as a gift for my son's 6th birthday and we have been playing ever since. This game has some flowes (instructions could be more detailed and all text is in one direction, so only one player faces it right, also names of towns can be obscured by trains, and there is nowhere on board to put cards so not every player can easily reach them) but in general it is fun and engaging. I think this game is suitable for children who at least can read alphabet letters and have patience and/or like board games. This one reminds me of Candy Lane, but in a much more advanced version.

  Great game for young kids.Each city (on the map & destination tickets) has a unique image along with the city name so reading ability is not required. Kids just have to match the images on the cards with the images on the maps. My 5 and a half year old enjoyed it - we immediately played a second game right after the first. And my wife and I mildly enjoyed playing as well, which is more than you can ask for in a children's game.Game play really is similar to regular Ticket to Ride, just watered down. And it does play much faster, which is good.

  I've played and really liked the original TTR, and had been looking at picking it up and playing with my daughter using modified rules for kids found on boardgamegeek.com.  In the end, I decided for the children's version for my just turned six year old.It's simpler and a smaller scale, but still very engaging.  My daughter quickly picked up on the game, using her wild cards well, using existing track to connect new routes, etc.  Bottom line is that she loves the game, and the box and board itself are much more appealing to a kid.  It's a sharp box.We really enjoy playing this, and has been fun to play even as an adult.  It's such an engaging and stimulating game, and I enjoy seeing my daughter's brain work and solve the puzzle of the routes.I can't recommend this game enough, especially if you already like the original TTR and want to introduce it to your young one.

After a few plays we are definitely ready to move on to the adult version of Ticket to Ride.Reasoning for my lower star rating is because we received the U.S. version but the stock photo on Amazon shows the European version.

The game setup is nice and what you remember from childhood
","

  The game setup is nice and what you remember from childhood, if you played this growing up. My main disappointment is on the questions for kids. So many of them revolve around pop culture, specific to TV shows, music, and movies. Really? Why can’t questions be about more than that, or ask about more recent historical events rather than the name of Hannah Montana’s third boyfriend. The kids didn’t enjoy it that much because of that. Admittedly we don’t watch a lot of TV but even if we did and they knew the answers, it might make me question what they are “learning” versus what they should be learning. Lots of better games out there to play as a family than this one such as Ticket to Ride or Pandemic. Save your money.

  We're having fun playing as a family, but they've really dumbed-down the questions for this version. My kids (12 & 14) can handle many of the ""adult"" questions, and the kid questions are often ridiculously easy. Also they're often centered around the same thing, like the TV show Glee. Who came up with these questions? Why were they so obsessed with Glee? Why do they think kids watched Glee? It would also be nice if there were more question cards. There are only two small packets (one for kids and one for adults), and we're already seeing the same questions, even though we've only played three times.

  Depending on the age group of your family will determine how well you like the game. I dont agree with the game for all ages.  We played over Christmas in teams and the 5 year old was only in charge of  handing out the pie pieces and putting the questions back in the holder. Until she quit from boredom. The 10 and 12 year old team did pretty good with some of the kid questions. The 7 year old was teamed up with 82 year old pop pop and we switched between kid and adult questions each round. I dont think either one of them cared much either way. There was nothing quick about the game if you follow the rules. We changed it up to speed it up. First ditched the board. The team got to choose what color question they needed for their pie when it was their turn.  If you got a yellow, pink, blue etc  question right you got that color pie piece. Each team only got 1 question per turn. The first team to fill up their pie with each different color wins. That still took over an hour 1/2 to play that way.

  My husband and I have six children between 4 and 16. I remember playing Trivial Pursuit with my aunts and uncles growing up but it was a pretty frustrating game for the kids. I thought this ""family edition"" would be fun for everyone and it is ok but I'm not sure how well it will hold up once the novelty wears off.So far, I've played with the media-savvy 11-, 14-, and 16-year olds several times. My 4-year old likes to roll the die for everyone and give the card to whoever's reading the question and put the wedge in if the answer is right so in that regard, it's a win because she feels like she's playing right along with everybody else.The 14- and 16-year old, in particular, are torn between whether they want to do the grownup cards or the kid cards. The 11-year old definitely wants the kid cards even though a lot of them are super easy for him. With my less-media-savvy 10- and 12-year olds, I think the kid cards might be a little more challenging.Even with four or five people playing, the game moves pretty quickly which is a good thing. It usually takes around 30-40 minutes for a full game.Some of the kid questions off the top of my head:* What Leonardo Da Vinci painting is known for its mysterious smile?* Which of the following is not one of Mario's cousins: Luigi, Yoshi, or Wario?* What is the name of Spongebob's pet snail: Larry, Barry, or Gary?* What is the name of the high school on Glee?* Deltoids, Trapezii, and biceps are examples of muscles, bones, or viruses?* An ankylosaurus can be identified by the horns on its head, a club tail, or because it's the size of a chicken?Some of the adult questions:* What investment banker admitted to running the largest Ponzi scheme in history?* What author is responsible for both Jurassic Park and ER?* What Twitter aficionado was married to Demi Moore?* Which famous composer had 20 children? (this was multiple choice but I don't remember the choices)* Katniss Everdeen is the protagonist of what novel?For both the adult and kid cards, I could do with fewer questions about TV and celebrities because that's just not our thing. Overall, though, we're having fun with it.

Good, but adult cards are too easy.
","

  This Trivial Pursuit game is modified for sped-up game time and age-appropriate questions, but the adult cards are too easy.On this board, every square adds a pie piece to your game piece, making for a faster game for younger ones with shorter attention spans.This game has two sets of cards—one for kids and one for adults. My 6-year-old can get less than half of the questions in the kids’ set without help, so I’d guess that that set is probably best for 8-10-year-olds.  The adult set is maybe best for 10-15-year-olds (just guessing; I don’t have a lot of kids in that age range in my life). Neither set is great for grown-ups. The grown-up cards  are significantly easier than regular Trivial Pursuit, with a large minority of the questions being true/false or multiple choice questions.I suppose the easier adult cards were also designed for faster gameplay, but if you’re a fan of Trivial Pursuit who wants your young child to have a chance at winning, it isn’t going to happen with this game (although, as a dyed-in-the-wool nerd, I did find the pop culture questions challenging—there are many kinds of intelligence and keeping up with pop culture is apparently not one of mine 😂).  If you want to give your child a shot at winning, I recommend that you buy this version AND an adults-only version of Trivial Pursuit, and use the cards from the adults-only version as your adult cards.  Unfortunately, that makes this a rather expensive game.On the other hand, if you want a game that your tween and younger teen can play together, then this might be the perfect thing.  Or if Trivial Pursuit isn’t your cup of tea, but it is your child’s, and you’d just as soon that the adult cards were easy to get it over with, you may appreciate this game unmodified.

AWESOME
","

  We have played this game so many times now!  It moves along much better than the original trivial pursuit because you don't eatin control of the board by answering correctly, play moves on whether you're right or wrong.  Makes for a nice time frame.  Modifying the rules to fit what you like works well here also, we have friends who play it a couple different ways.  Our main group ages are 47, 42 and 17-  we mix the cards up so that it just the luck of the draw whether you get a really easy one, or a really hard one.  That makes for lots of laughs.We have also played with age groups ranging from 11 to 50.  It is the most fun when there are adults and kids mixed up.  We tried it with all adults and it just didn't seem to do as well.  But for families with kids/teenagers/young adults/adults, I HIGHLY recommend it!

Family Game Night

  This classic-style Trivial Pursuit game is perfect for Family Game Night.My two daughters (first and fourth grade) even play it together.The questions are elementary school-friendly, but are challenging for as high as high school.Example questions are:Which pop singer calls her fans ""little monsters""?Which Greek's body was invincible, except for his foot?What is the everyday name for sodium chloride?The game follows the classic Trivial Pursuit fashion. You move your empty pie around the board, collecting different colored wedges.

  They have changed the game play to the point where it's a bit flat.  There's no roll again if you get one right. There's no wedge piece spots.  You get a wedge for answering any question in that category. You aren't allowed to go backwards.  It's just weird.  I guess we could just use The old rules but we would have to alter The board. Also the board is cheap.  We'll play it occasionally but we're disappointed in the changes.

  If you like the original trivial pursuit and are looking for an updated version... this is not it. It's a quick-play version of the original game, and the questions are hard. Most of the kids questions are so hard that the adults couldnt answer them. The game (from start to finish) took maybe 10 minutes, and now it will forever live in my closet because the chances of playing it again are slim to none. Only giving it 2 stars because if you take the new questions and mix them with the original game and use the original game board - youd be gold. Shipping was fast.

For example, the first kids' question we pulled was ""Who is the Big Red Dog?""Other than that, there was a pretty good mix of questions, and the game play is the same as with other Trivial Pursuit versions.

My Son LOVES This!
","Trivial Pursuit Family Edition Game

As a longtime Trivial Pursuit lover, I have MANY different versions of this loved game.  Recently, my son has wanted to start playing.  Since most of the versions I have are very difficult, he was frustrated by not knowing the info (he's only 9, and I have genus editions).So, I went looking for a TP we could play together.  Enter Family Edition.  The questions for him are hard enough to be challenging for him, but he still knows enough of the answers to level the playing field.  The only down side is that there aren't any new cards to bulk up the set.  We've played it so much we're circling back to questions he's already learned.As gripes go, that's really minimal.  Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase!

We have owned lots of versions of Trivial Pursuit through the years (Genus, Genus III, Genus IV, Genus V, Millennium, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Silver Screen, and one or two more I don't recall), but this has the fewest question cards of any of them.  The kids enjoyed it, though, and the scaled down game play (getting pie every question) makes for a faster game.

So when we get a question about something they couldn't know, we choose a different card.The nice thing is that you get a pie for every space.  In the traditional game it's only on the end of the spokes.  This quickly made sense to us, because kids wouldn't be able to play for 2 hours.

  This is a fun family game in the style of regular Trivial Pursuit.  You can play this game as teams or individuals, and the concept is simple for younger kids to follow.  The game comes w/ adult level cards and kid level cards.  Though the instructions say to pick a level and stick to it, you can change the rules and play both if you'd like.  We have chosen to play as 2 teams and start w/ the adult level cards.  If the kids feel that the question is too difficult, we give them the option to choose a kid card instead.  Changing the rules a little has made this game very adaptable for younger kids and adults to enjoy.

It is similar to the traditional Trivia Pursuit that I remember from my youth but it has been modified to speed up the game a bit.

An Amazing Update Over the Original
","

  Dominion had me hooked when I first played it. It is an incredible and fun game. After 8-years, the designer has gone back and removed some of the weaker cards. By replacing these cards Dominion is even more enjoyable than it already was. Someone new to the game should start here with this Second Edition. The removed cards really won't be missed and what is added really improves things.In addition to removing and adding cards, the treasures and victory cards now have artwork which is awesome. There is a trash mat to put your trashed cards on. Cards have improved wordings to avoid confusion. The rule book has been revamped and is easier to understand. Also, instances of he, his, him, etc. have all been replaced with the gender neutral ""their.""As a huge Dominion fan, I can't recommend this second edition enough to someone planning on giving this game a try. And, hey, if you have all the expansions, there is even a separate upgrade pack you can buy with the 7 new cards. So, you don't have to buy the game all over again.

Good improvements to a great game!

  Dominion is one of my favorite games! I have played literally hundreds of games of Dominion and still find it to be very enjoyable.I am happy to see this second edition as it demonstrates that demand for this game is still pretty high, and the changes they made in this edition all seem to make good sense.Especially if you don't plan to get any expansions, I think the new edition will stand on its own even better than the original.CHANGES IN THIS SECOND EDITION1) 6 Kingdom Cards (sets of 10) from the original edition have been removed (Adventurer, Chancellor, Feast, Spy, Thief, Woodcutter)2) 7 NEW Kingdom Cards have been added (Artisan, Bandit, Harbinger, Merchant, Poacher, Sentry, Vassal)3) Artwork on the ""base cards"" has been updated (Copper, Silver, Gold, Estate, Dutchy, Province, Curse).4) The Rulebook contains some clarifications and wording improvements.5) Some of the original Kingdom cards have been reworded to be more clear and precise. (Three cards received minor functional errata: ""You may"" has been added to Moneylender, Mine, and Throne Room)While I'm sad to see Adventurer and Thief removed in particular, the new cards are fun and I am looking forward to playing more games with them. (Of course, since I still have the originals, I'll still be mixing them in at home anyway :) )I think the new base card artwork looks nice, and is an improvement from both the original edition and the current ""Dominion Base Cards"" set. (Rio Grande Games has said that future printings of the ""Base Cards"" set will use this second ed. artwork)You can see the new rulebook and card text on RGG's websiteAlso, if you have an original edition and only want the 7 new Kingdom Cards, there is an ""Upgrade Pack"" available that contains only the new cards. I thought that was a pretty great thing for RGG to do, as it basically gives original owners a bonus ""mini expansion"".

I own almost all the Dominion stuff, should I buy this too?
","

  You should know a couple of things about me:I have all the previously released Dominion games and expansions.  Including the promo cards.  The only thing I am missing is the ""Base Cards"" set.I wondered, like many of you, is it worth it to get this after having all the rest?  Well, I think yes.  The base card artwork has the best of both worlds in my opinion.  Nicer pictures/designs but still has the large numbers printed on them.  This is what kept me from the ""Base Card"" set.  Where the copper had a nice picture of copper coins, but no giant 1.  This adds those on top of the coin art.  A nice touch.  The new kingdom cards should be great.  Realistically, once you have as many cards as are available across all editions, I don't think 7 more is going to make or break the whole experience.  But they do seem interesting to play with.The trash ""mat"" is a bit of a disappointment. I'm a type A person, and didn't mind the trash card.  The mat is a thin cardboard type, but much thinner at first look than the mats in Seaside or Adventures.  The edges of the mat stick up a little bit at the top and it doesn't lay flat.However, the cards are nice and flat.  My set of Adventures is a disaster.  The cards bow so badly they barely fit in the tray.  The rest of my card sets are fine and this is no exception.  The printing on the cards seems to be a little more refined and better color than my other Dominion set.  I purchased the first edition last November, so it's not all that old.As for packaging, some of my Dominion sets came with some crazy damage to the plastic tray and inlay cards.  The inlay card for this set was in the rule booklet, so no damage there.  The card packs bounced around some and ripped and dented the tray a bit, but it should still hold the cards. I do like how the inlay card was protected.  A couple of my other expansions had the inlay card damaged and ripped to the point that some serious tape was needed to keep it somewhat whole.If you already own the 1st edition would I recommend this set?  If you were going to buy the upgrade pack, I would say just get this whole set.  You will get the Trash mat (kind of cool, see issues above) and the new base cards (very nice as noted above, and those can wear out a bit since you use them every game).  You also get the rule book.  Which is NOT included in the upgrade pack.  Also, then you have the clarified wording on a couple of cards, which I don't think matters much, until it matters in a game against an 11 year old.  If you are worried about the duplication of much of the game, take out the discontinued cards, keep them for yourself for posterity, and give the rest of the game away to someone to introduce them to the game.I don't share this view on the Intrigue upgrade.  I don't think it worth it to replace the whole box there.  Just get the upgrade pack and deal with the missing rulebook.  But this one, I think it's worth it.I didn't get paid for my review, I paid full price for this and all my Dominion games and cards and enjoy playing them with my son.  Also, I think this is my first review on Amazon, but wanted to help my fellow gamers out on this one, since the game is familiar, and there is some information out there, but maybe not quite enough.

Best deck building game EVER!
","

  This is the best deck building game EVER!!I am in my 20's and have only recently been introduced to deck building games, and instantly fell in love.DOminion and the DC Comic deck games are my favorite, but Dominion provides a larger variety because the cards used change.The game its self comes with several possible versions of the game.For example, the game is plaid with several action card decks to draw from, but Dominion comes with twice as many action cards. So, no game is exactly alike. The rule book comes with various options of which action cards to play with for certain kinds of games.This game is dynamic!I first played Dominion at a bar with board games. After a few times I fell in love and bought this second edition. The cards are beautiful, more colorful than the first edition. (I attached some photos to see to see the cards)It says that the game can be played in about 30 minutes... for me it takes closer to an hour with 3 players. It also probably depends on what type of game you play (which actions cards to choose to play with) But because we are still learning, maybe we go a little slower, constantly re reading what the action cards say/do.At the end of the game, who ever has the most victory points wins.

Perfect gateway deckbuilder!

  Dominion may have its haters, but I am not one.  This is an EXCELLENT game if you are a new gamer, new to deck building, or just want something a little lighter (but still thinky) to play.  The lightly medieval theme can be a plus when you're playing with people who don't like fantasy, sci-fi, etc.  (Those people can be very hard to please.)  With the variety of cards available, you can tailor the game to your audience and always keep things fresh.  Want a lot of interaction and back-stabbing?  Play with Witches and Militia and other attack cards.  Want a peaceful game?  Play without attack cards.  Want a longer game that encourages people to build up a huge deck?  Play with Gardens!The possibilities are seemingly endless, especially if you add in expansions.  The game in itself is fairly easy to teach if people can remember A-B-C-D.  You play an Action (one only), then Buy one card, then Cleanup and Deal your next hand.  If you're lucky, you'll play cards that give you +1 Action or +1 Buy, allowing you to play more actions or buy more than one card.  The order in which you play your action cards can require strategy, as you want to ensure that you can play as many of them as possible each hand.  New players may need to reveal their hand for their first few rounds to get advice, but they usually catch on pretty quickly.

Great 2 player game, very replayable, not hard to teach.

  This is the best two person game I've played since Splendor. (Also great with up to 4 people, but who am I kidding. I'm not that social.) I love that there are a billion expansions should we get sick of the set of cards that comes with this base set, but with the ability to change out action cards to make the game different every time, I'm still not craving new cards after about 30 runs.It's also easy to share this game with friends. Even those non-hardcore board game friends will pick it up relatively fast. The only downside is how intense the game setup looks, it can scare people off to see 16 piles of cards covered in text on the table.

Not a dumb game, but not one where you need hours of learning before you can play... a new player can be up and going in < 5min instructions and fully in the game, playing, trying strategies, fully immersed and enjoying it from the very first game!Card artwork:  very nice!Balance of strategy and luck:  perfect!Good to play with 2 player:  VERY GOODGood to play with 3-4 players:  VERY GOOD!Good for adults:  Amazing!Good for 12 years old kid:  Amazing!The fact that there are 8+ optional add-on sets of cards that you can get, making this game a seemingly ENDLESS sets of combinations which makes the game feel like a new game every time.  The mechanics remain the same but the cards and their values and attributes can be different depending on what set of card you use to play.I can't recommend this game enough!Background:  We are a gaming family.Our best games this year have been:  (we got many many more but these are the very best).And now, Dominion is probably at the top of our list!

What a fun game. Never-ending play possibilities
","

  What a fun game.  Never-ending play possibilities.  I made ""placemats"" with ""A"" (action), ""B"" (Buy), and ""C"" (Clean up) spaces.  I also added ""D"" (discard).  And I drew a space for the ""deck"".  This made it easier to keep everything in order as we learned the game.  After we learned how to play we don't need the placemats but we still use them.  Our friends enjoy this game also and we play it again and again.  It did take a little time to learn it, but once you play it once, you'll enjoy it so much more after.  Follow the suggested layouts first to get the hang of it before playing random layouts.  This game is just awesome.  Take the time to learn it and it will become a favorite.  Not for small children although my 8 year old grandson plays it ok with just a little help.  I would say 10 and up would be more appropriate.

In Pandemic times, this is a great family game
","

  In Pandemic times, this is one of the best ""family"" games. I taught my 8 year old and he was able to understand the simple game mechanic (it has been used in many, many other games, e.g. Marvel Legendary). It's a short game, that kids like and is challenging enough with enough variation that it won't be the same (especially with changing the cards). Only caveats with playing with kids is 1) they have trouble shuffling, 2) cards will get sticky. The rules of the game are simple, but the font and directions in the rule book are harder to read. (Compared to other similar games). I suggest you watch a video on how to play. There are an insane amount of of expansions. I suggest Prosperity, because kids like playing with lots of money. Enjoy!

Great game; excellent replay value; easy to learn, moderate to master.
","

  I am a moderately serious board gamer and have a monthly group at home (serious) and a weekly lunch group at work (somewhat casual). The first time I played this I immediately purchased a set for myself and have regularly played it. It's pretty easy for new people to pick up, although they're unlikely to win until they've played a few times to understand useful strategies. The ability to pick a set of cards each time you play gives it a really high replay ability, and you can tweak the sets to get your favorite balance. Tons of great expansions. If you pick cards that don't have any inter-player effects you can finish a game in under an hour, which means this is part of the rotation for my lunchtime game group at work. Even with a bigger group and inter-player interaction cards it will definitely finish in under 2 hours; we frequently play two rounds with different sets of cards. It also travels well because you can pick out a set and leave the box at home.

  We have gifted this game more than any other. We routinely give this to friends particularly friends with kids. We have taught kids as young as 9 and adults as old as 85. The game is easy to set up with no complicated board, rules and pieces. It can easily be taught while people play which alleviates boredom and short attention span problems. There are multiple possible choices of games which makes it great choice for an evening or a complete family vacation. And play moves fairly quickly with most games ending in 30-60 minutes. Everyone loves this game. People learn the game and the basic big money strategy quickly. We often give people expansions as well with Prosperity and the duration cards from Seaside being favorites. I highly recommend this game.

  This is a fun game that is very modular, it can change a lot from game to game.  It can be a bit hard to learn a deck-building game if you have never played one, but this is pretty approachable entry level game.Die hard fans may complain about the new edition removing some of the old cards, but the old edition always had about 6-8 cards that none of my friends ever played with because they just bogged down your deck and didn't add much to the game.  The cards in the second edition are mostly the same, but several of the low-utility cards have been replaced with more versatile cards.

We were on an average of fourteen games a day, and let me tell you, it's hard to respect your intimate partner after ninety-five back to back games of Dominion, especially if you only stop to sleep, phone the police and frantically negotiate with the team of international jewel thieves laying siege to your panic room while they try to get you to give up the combination to your jewel safe.Great game, though.

Worth Every Penny

  I played this game one weekend with my mother-in-law and she became hooked. It's really competitive, very fast-paced, and nothing beats stringing together a series of card combos (on the flipside it sucks when an opponent does that haha).If you don't want to devote 1+ hours to a board game then this is the game to pick. It's a deck-building game and since there are a near infinite amount of card combinations, you don't have to play the same game twice. It's customizable and you're able to attune it to your group's need.Worth every penny.

  This is an excellent game, but I'll use my review to talk about the construction quality.# Pros #* High quality outer shell on box.* Cards are well made, thick cardstock. They can take a lot of abuse.# Cons #* Card wrapping is poor, a couple of the decks were already partially unwrapped in the box, causing them to acquire some scuffs on the edges during the UPS ride.* Inner plastic molding designed to hold the cards is cheap. It was bent and broken in several places, but manages to do its job after I bent some edges back to their original place. I'll probably be looking for something else to store the cards in.

Even without taking attack cards into account, you are competing with others for limited resources, and I know that the actions of the other players definitely influence my own actions.I've only played around 10 games, but I have a feeling I'll be playing this game for a while after this.

This particular copy we bought as a gift, for another friend who joined us and also loved the game.  Our daughter was about 8 when she started to play...she didn't get all the strategy at first, but she still really enjoyed it.  It takes a little bit of effort to learn how to play, like all games, it's better if someone teaches you while you play, but it's fun and varying each game.  Lots of fun.

Decent game, poor storage organization
","

  This game makes for a nice change from regular Monopoly with the game being both team-based and focused on territorial control over pure wealth.Players form even teams and go around the board claiming free tiles, stealing them from other players, or locking them down by cementing control. Team members share money and properties. The game ends once all properties have been claimed and one team has the majority.The game itself goes pretty quickly with properties bouncing back and forth and having spaces that take a player to the nearest unclaimed spot. As players share resources, discussing strategy is important as to stop overextension (as running out of money can start a brutal chain reaction). Out first game stayed rather even to the end, with it ending with a score of 9-7, a llama victory.Where the game really fails is organization. The components include character pieces, dice, a property deck, 2 chance decks, a set of control tokens for each team, and some money (in two denominations, $100 and $500). To hold all this, you're given a basic bankers try for the standard monopoly game. This means besides the money, which only needs two of the slots, nothing fits right. And to further top it off, you can't keep it in the tray as the box is too short to allow the cards to remain upright in the slots, forcing a person to either throw everything together (either in the tray or loose in the box) or have a box that is unable to be closed all the way.

Team Unicorn FTW!
","

   Super cute! You are divided up into teams. Instead of buying properties, it's most titles like ""Most Fluffiest"" to win game. The tokens are plastic Unicorn and Llama pieces in pastel colors. It's an Amazon exclusive so maybe that's why it's pricier than your average Monopoly board game and why I took away a star. Fun for young and young at heart!

Fun family game
","

  This is a really fun game. I'd say it's best for ages 7+ The were a few things that weren't explained well in the rules, but we were able to decide the rules ourselves and move on with the game.  Compared to original monopoly, game play is faster and more competitive, players are sorted into teams, and there were lots of laughs as chance cards include fun ways to get ahead or bring the opposing team down. We found that if teams aren't even there's a slight advantage to the team with fewer players, as their tokens will pass Go more frequently. I think next time we will modify by using the same number of game pieces per team and having the odd person out choose between the teammates tokens on their turn. Overall we enjoyed the game a lot and will definitely play often.

Fun enough.
","

  It’s kind of a weird version of monopoly. I mean, I’m not sure what I expected since it’s llamas vs unicorns. My daughter wanted it for Christmas so I (I mean Santa) got it for her. The game goes fast so I don’t feel like I have to pull my hair out trying to finish the game.The game ends when all the “properties” are bought. But the properties are properties like the original version, they are traits. Traits like “Coolest Room Decor” or “Most likely to Save the Day”. So you can “buy” and collect traits, but that also means you can take traits from other players. Each trait switches hands super fast. At first I didn’t like it because I kept thinking of them like properties from the original monopoly. But you just have to think of them as traits because that’s what they are. Think of them as the “Most likely to ...” from the high school year book. If you aren’t popular one week you’re not cool anymore and the next person gets the glory.

Not Regulation Sized Cheap Representation of Monopoly

  I was disappointed in this product. It is not regulation sized. The player pieces are cheap plastic, and the 'hotels' are simply cardboard rectangles with pictures of rainbows. This may suffice for children ages 5-10, but certainly not for teens or adults. (Yes, even adults like llamas and unicorns).

Loves Unicorns and/or Llamas.... this game is for you!
","

  My daughter is into both unicorns and llamas and was delighted to receive this game. We have played a few times so far. It is easy to learn. Similar, but different to monopoly. Such as you are not buying and then adding houses/hotels. You work with only two values of money versus the multiple in Monopoly. I like how it is simplified so children can be the banker and still keep things moving at a decent pace. Lots of opportunities to incorporate math and reading into play. Encourages team building when you have multiple players. Provides positive attributes and relatable content for purchasing such most huggable or best room decor. My son played, but at five he tired easily and had no interest in finishing.

  The product box came damaged extensively in an undamaged Amazon box, which means it was damaged before shipping. It was “punched through” to the inside playing piece container. The game itself was not damaged. I used gorilla tape to fix the box so pieces wouldn’t get lost. The game play is fun for the kids. Kind of silly but hey it keeps them entertained. 2 stars for the careless nature in which I was sold this item.

Fun Team Version

  This version of Monopoly is quicker than standard Monopoly and you're divided into teams. The team approach makes it easy for younger kids to get in on the Monopoly fun without having a clear understanding of the game. If they can roll a dice and count, they can play! The rules are a bit different than monopoly and money only comes in 100s and 500s. It is a simplified, but fun, version of Monopoly.

Room for improvement but overall a light fun family game
","

  We're all about the family games in our household, this one was added at Christmas for our 10 yr old children. The game play itself has some of the traditional Monopoly game play (chance, free parking, pass go, go to jail, etc) outside of that the game play is very different than the original, and much lighter (good for younger kids). The only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars is due to some of the rules not being clear (for example, one of the chance cards lets you move any player from the other team to the space you're on and they must follow the rules of that space... but it doesn't say what that looks like for Jail, if you're in jail and call someone to that place are they just visiting or do they go to jail with you?) Just a few little things like that - overall though, we had a lot of fun playing this light game as a family.

  This game was pretty confusing. And NOT for an odd number of players because you don’t take turns around in a circle. There are two teams and you take turns by a llama player going then a unicorn player going. So odd number of players is weird.

It was very easy for my 5 year old to learn, and it is helping my 7 year old build critical thinking and strengthen her adding skills. The game breaks you up into unicorns vs llamas, and we find it better to do one adult and one child per team. The game board is smaller (8x8 instead of 10x10) and it’s claims that the game ends when all spots are purchased, so it it a shorter game to keep the littles’ attention.

  For first game with an 8 and 11 year old, I took out only the 22 North America cards.  We played with 7 cards each.Before starting, I did a quick overview - how many continents are there?  Can you name them (Oceania was less well known than Australia as continent name) ?  How many countries (wow - LOTS)?  Then looked at the 4 facts on each card, pointing out what M (million) and K (thousand) meant.  Looked over the map.  They were ready for the entire set by the end of the first small game.  We briefly looked at a map of the world that showed the names of all the countries.  Biggest take away for 8 year old - how really tiny countries can have enormous populations.  If I move to using the challenge facts, I'll start small again - beginning with North America.Their mother told me that night they couldn't stop talking about the game.

Good, fun learning tool -- just add your own tweaks!

  Our family recently purchased The World Game. This review reflects us (three adults) having played it several times.We'd say it's fun in a learning-is-fun kind of way. The cards are well made, and included with the set is a map of the world of good, sturdy paper.One of the nice things about the game is that you can modify play in a variety of ways. The rules as provided, while fine, need not limit how you want to approach learning about other countries. For instance, we initially began playing with a mix of cards representing countries from all over the globe...pretty challenging unless you're already good at geography, which we are not (yet)!So instead, we'll work on countries one continent at a time.But that's just one example of how you can do your own thing.Also, we've noticed that the game's creator listens to suggestions from players. He fulfilled the wish of one online commenter by sending a pdf of countries in alphabetical order with their corresponding numerical designation on the game's map. We got that list when we purchased the game. And actually, we made our own list too, arranging the countries in numerical order so we can immediately find the name of any country on the map. Another addition we intend to make on our spreadsheet is primary languages spoken (data we will obtain through our own research).So, obviously, there are lots of ways you can expand on The World Game if you like. It is a cool little learning tool.

  I’m a huge geography nerd and wanted to try this game out to see if it could challenge me, and I absolutely loved it! It’s a great study and learning tool if you really want to refine your geography skill. The game itself is quite fun and I loved that you could play with pretty much anyone regardless of how good they were at geography with the use of game styles that can be altered per person, for example my gf is not good at geography so I would only ask her what continent the country was at, inversely I’m good at countries but am not so good at capital cities. Like this we had a very fair game where I was beat. Liked it a lot and would recommend it especially as a learning tool for geography teachers and professors. I would also say that they should have an expansion pack for physical geography and such, which would make the game even more challenging!

The geography flashcard set I was looking for
","

  First, the product is solid. Great design, well-crafted, and sturdy. The cards themselves are durable and high quality, and the foldable map insert is designed well.Second, the game itself is fun and made such that you can play a 5 minute game or for hours. I've played it with my 9-year old nephew and my parents. You can make it as competitive as you want.But as a geography trivia nut, you don't need anyone else to play the game to enjoy it. The flash cards are just fun to flip through and quiz yourself. It's a great learning device and fits the bill as exactly what I was looking for.

Helpful supplement and fun for kids

  I bought this game to supplement my middle schooler's understanding of geography and the larger world. She loves the Top Trumps card games so this was an easy sell even though it's ""educational"" and not just for fun. There are different ways to use the cards to help give your child a better sense of the world and geography. I've found the game to be a great jumping off point for conversations. She asks to play it so that's a good sign! I gave it four stars instead of five because it'd be nice if there was a bit more information about the nations on the cards. There were also a couple of errors with the numbering and the nation's they match up to on the world map.

  I bought this game for my 8 year old grandson.  He loves it!  I had to buy another copy for myself so that I can study and be able to play with him (and perhaps reawaken a few old brain cells).  We visited Temple Square in Salt Lake City, UT, where the young missionaries serving as guides all have a flag on their name tags showing where they are from.  My grandson was able to recognize all the flags...even Siberia!...and amazed us all.  Upon returning home I ordered a second set for myself.

Fun Learning Geography

  My 9 year old is hooked on geography. He loves these cards and its games. Cards of good quality. There are at least several ways to use these cards one of which is plain old flash card method. Each card shows flag of country, country name, capital city and country facts. Card info corresponds to a map included with purhcase. The games offered vary from a sort of ""war card game"" where a player chooses a fact they think will trump other player's cards to idenitifying country by flag, continent, etc.We paid 25 bucks, which is a bit steep in my book, but everything seems to be getting more expensive these days. As mentioned, product is of good quality and its hard to put a price tag on stirring a child's fascination to learn. In this respect, priceless.Highly recommend

  Simple game with cards representing all the world's countries. Definitely don't need to know tons about geography as you will learn as you go.

  This is one of the best educational board game!  I have bought it to my 11 years old son, to extend his geography knowledge and sense of the world. It really helps him to orientate on the map and have better understanding of countries location.It also gives knowledge about population of every country and flags. After playing a couple of times he can name the good number of countries by their flags.It is very good for adults too - you will refresh your internal geography  database and even learn something new.Pros:Very good polygraphic quality of every piece - cards, map, box.  The box is very solid - you won't break it even if you step on it. Every picture is very colorful and bright. Cards are thick and also look sturdy.The game itself is very interesting and enjoying. You gonna learn a lot playing any variant of the game.194 cards with flags, capitals, population, highest point and number of neighboring countries.Detailed, well marked colorful map for easier navigation.Cons:Nothing come up to my mind

  This game is Awesome!  Basic game is like the game 'war' played with real cards, but the information on the cards makes it a challenge and takes strategy to learn the countries in play and how they relate to each other.  My daughter (10th grade) and I are in a race to see who can memorize the capitals and flags faster (194 of each).  I think she would have enjoyed this at any age because there is enough chance in who gets what cards so no ones' feelings are hurt, but enough strategy that there are possibilities for increasing the odds of winning.

  This is not a game we bought for kids. My spouse and I bought it to complement our collection of other board and card games, for something different for us to do sometimes.  If you want an occasional 5 - 10 minute distraction and learn or be reminded of country names, location, and flag then this could be fun for you too.

  It’s basically a small deck of cards with (4) facts like area, population, highest point and the total amount of neighboring countries.  It doesn’t even list the neighboring countries.  The cards do show a flag and the capital.  I wish I realized it was a deck of cards and not a “board game” as advertised in the title.  For the cost, I would have expected more of a Trivial Pursuit type board game and not a deck of playing cards for the most part.  It’s certainly not worth $30.

  One of the best games ever! Don’t let the amount of pieces in the box scare you. If you’re not good with following directions on paper, watch some YouTube videos on how to play. Once you get the concept, you’ll want to keep playing again and again. The expansions are so much fun once you play a few rounds of the standard game. I strongly suggest playing a few rounds without the expansion so you can grasp the concept of the game before adding in new rules. It will be much less complicated that way. This game is great regardless if it’s 2 players or 5...the more players, the longer the game play. Everyone in our group has different strategies and everyone has won at least once...so what works for one, may not work for another or what worked for someone during one game, may not work in another game. This is one of our top games, though, and we’ve played a LOT during our game nights with friends.

With a random layout and using  zero, one, or both expansions, it's never the same game twice.  It plays extremely well with all player counts.All of the components are very good quality with one exception.  The cardboard money doesn't seem to hold up really well.

  Istanbul, ganador del Kennerspiel des Jahres es un excelente euro medio, realmente recomendable; este big box trae sus dos expansiones siendo excelentes para aumentar la estrategia del juego y el precio de lo mejor — es como si compraras el juego base y por muy poco más (100-200 pesos) obtengas las expansiones (o que compres las expansiones y te regalen el juego base); es una excelente compra, ya sea que estés explorando  en juegos de mesa ( y hayas jugado unos cuantos) o ya tengas recorrido en ellos. Si tuvieras dudas, puedes comprar el juego para tus dispositivos (iOS o Android) y por poco dinero comprobar la mecánica y dinámica del juego para animarte (o no) a comprar esta versión que vale cada Lira!!

  We have owned Istanbul for quite some time and when we found there was a version with 2 expansions we jumped on it. Basically cheaper and more convenient to have it all in One Big Box. The standalone Istanbul is one of our favorite on our boardgame nights . Have only played this once and can't wait to get the chance again.

Same gameplay, not the same pieces as original
","

  I bought this for my daughter for her birthday with fond memories of my own pretty pretty princess game from when I was a kid. Mine had a jewelry box and the crown was round, this has no jewelry box so pieces aren’t contained at all in the game box, and the crown is the cheap plastic tiara kind attached to a headband. And in my original game the black ring had a slightly different shape than the other rings (made it feel more sinister!” In this all the rings are the same except color. All in all if I didn’t know what the game used to be I probably would have loved this, but I was disappointed in the changes since my childhood. My daughter on the other hand loves it just as much as I did when I was little!

  This was my absolute favorite game growing up in the 90's and now that I have a 4 year old I of course bought it for her. She LOVES this game and plays it daily. Unfortunately, it is not the same game I grew up with and after less than a month  the board has already broken. There is no case to store the jewelry in so it is just kinda lose in the box (the original game had a case to store jewelry, a mirror on the lid, and you could store the crown around the outside of it. ) The earrings are the worst and the little clip repeatedly falls off. Durability wise it's awful but the game itself is still pretty much the same.

  This game was so very much fun twenty years ago for our daughters.  They both played it, dawn to dusk for a very, very long time!  They enjoyed it thoroughly and always got it out to play when other girls came to play, or they could convince the family to play ""Again!"".  We were careful to keep track of the multiple jewelry pieces when we went to put the game away.  Not having all of the pieces is how our copy began to be used less and less.  We did find a few children's jewelry pieces to substitute as a few of the originals were lost.  Our girls loved it and when I bumped into it recently, I purchased it for our granddaughter.  I'm hoping she'll love it just as much as her mom and aunt did!

Disappointed, Cheap Plastic
","

  UPDATE: every single earring broke. I’ve repeatedly fixed them and some have permanently broke. Not worth it. I DO NOT recommend purchasing this - jewelry is poor quality. I had the original game from the 90s; this game fails in comparison. Most importantly, the plastic is really cheap and the earrings broke after first use. Every color earring clip broke. It does pop back in (which I’ve done several times) but it’s very disappointing. The crown also seems like it won’t last long. My daughter loves it so we’ll keep it. But I wouldn’t spend more than $5 on this (I regrettably spent more).So, would I recommend it? Yes if it’s $5. If it’s more, don’t waste your money.

  I bought this for my 1990s kid nostalgia:In a nutshell you all have a necklace, earrings, a ring, and a bracelet. There's one crown to fight over and the ""bad black ring."" Whoever gets all their pieces including the crown (and without the black ring) is the winner.I got this for our daughter on Christmas because it was a game I loved as a kid. The board and all the pieces of jewelry looked the same...Except for the main piece: The CROWN! I was quite disappointed in the cheapo Dollar Tree looking tiara they through in there instead of the pretty crown from the 90s version. And this game had no round, bejeweled jewelry box either. Be prepared to just lay all the jewelry in the center.Bottom line--its the cutest little game for girls/kids/whatever. It played just like the original! HOWEVER if you are buying this for nostalgia purposes, be prepared to be a little disappointed in the crown and missing jewelry box. I don't know if they wanted to go a cheaper route or what, but our tiara broke pretty quickly. If they make more with all the original pieces I'd buy another!

  If you enjoyed the original board & pieces from the 90s, this newer version is sure to disappoint. I miss the mirror jewlery box that you'd decorate with stick-on jewels, and the built-in spinner on the opposite side of the mirror (there's nowhere to put the jewlery other than on the board, and no mirror, and the spinner is a separate piece). I also miss the round crown with the stick-on jewels (but the tiara is cute), and the circular shaped board with the classic illustrations, and how the jewlery box and the crown fit in the center of the board (they instead drew a circle on a square shaped board). That said, it's the exact same game from the 90s, and the jewlery, other than the crown, is the same. It was gifted to a 3 year old who absolutely loves it and will enjoy it just fine. I still think it is a rip off version of the classic, cheaply and lazily made, but I'm glad it exists again!

Disappointed in the quality of this revival of the game pretty pretty princess

  I was so happy to buy this present for my daughter for her birthday. Unfortunately the earrings broke the first time we tried to open them up. I know this is a throwback version of the original game but my family had an original game for about 10 years and this one purchased here lasted Not even through one game round. I am sadly disappointed in the quality and if you’re familiar with the original game it has a different crown this one is cheap and will break easily. I wanted to return it but unfortunately I missed the return window but it is not worth the money or the time because it’s hard to explain to a six-year-old why her earrings clip on earrings are broken and she can’t be a pretty princess without them

I checked every few years to see if they were remaking it once I became a mom myself, but it was always a rare sighting on eBay where the going price for an original edition was in the hundreds. Yikes.Then suddenly, could it be? Hasbro has reissued the game with all the simplicity, glorious plastic jewelry, and glamorous fanfare I remember. The jewelry seems roughly the same in quality, but the game pawns are flimsier and the spinner and board are made out of pretty lightweight cardboard. My two year old snapped the board in half the first time I coerced my sons into playing.BUT I DONT CARE.

The board is thin, playing pieces flimsy, there is no longer a plastic jewelry box to hold the pieces in and the crown is a super cheap plastic tiara. I would personally rather pay a little more to have a higher quality product. If you have never seen or played the original version these things won’t bother you.

  I gave this sweet game to my niece for her birthday and she was thrilled. She's into games but was just turning 4, so it's the perfect game for a princess to incorporate games and dress up!

Same game from when I was a kid
","

  This game is exactly as I remember from being a kid and my three year old daughter loves it! The crown is different from what I remember, but in a good way, as it seems more durable and fit on my adult head. Other than that,  it's a great simple game that's exactly as I remembered from when i was a kid.

  Bought this in the 90's for my first daughter and was happy to see it was re-released and bought it for my second daughter. Within 3 times of playing it the ear rings started breaking and not because of her. The adults broke them trying to get them to work. Fun for kids, but very cheaply made!

  I use to play this game when I was young so when I saw it re-made I bought it for my daughter. Kinda disappointed the jewelry is made really cheap including the crown, it feels like if u bump it to hard it would break the earing latches as cheaply made and break very easily. I remember this game being sturdier now it’s super cheap

  Purchased for my daughter after she played the original Pretty Pretty Princess game at a relatives house. After searching for the game, the original one can only be purchased for $100+I love my daughter, but c'mon, paying that much for a board game sounds ridiculous. So I found this one on and it is everything the original game is. Everything is included except for a small storage container that the original one has to store so the jewelry. But that can easily be purchased at a dollar store.My daughter loves the game and the pieces are pretty durable considering her playing this game daily.

Possibly the funniest kids game I've ever played
","

  I review about 1 out of 50 things I buy but given how expensive games are and how hit or miss they can be, I wanted to come on here and give this game two giant thumbs up. I got this for my youngest daughter (10) for Christmas but we never ended up playing it before our older daughters went back to college. It's set up like apples to apples so you should have at least 4 to play. This weekend one of our girls came home for spring break and we took advantage of having 4 people at home and I'm really glad we did. We laughed for hours and played 6 games in a row, which is a miracle for us. We have all girls and they loved this but I can see how this would be an even bigger hit with boys. Lots of bodily functions mentioned on the answer cards with plenty of hilarious questions to take full advantage. The only thing I would say is that your family has to have some appreciation for bathroom humor or you won't enjoy this game. Its not a game you bring out and play with other people unless you know them well.

Okay for ages 6-10 yo

  I bought this as a gift for my sister, BIL and their four kids for Christmas. I wanted something fun and easy to play with a large family on game night. My nieces and nephews are 10, 12, 14, & 16 yo. While the youngest seemed to like it, the older ones got bored with its attempts of gross humor quickly. While it aims at being appropriately inappropriate, it just seems cheesy. - like the cards try too hard. I wish I would have picked something else.Most appropriately inappropriate for kids age 6-10yo who still find this potty humor funny.

Laugh So Hard You Cry
","

  Got this to play with the family over Thanksgiving because I have enjoyed playing Cards Against Humanity with adults before. The group consisted of two adults (one early 30's, one late 30's) and two kids (boy 11, girl 9). It was clear to see the difference in humor between the adults and kids, but that did not stop any of us from laughing our heads off. We must have played for a few hours, honestly I am not sure because we just kept going and going, laughing more and more. There were small giggles, loud laughs, unstoppable laughs, and literally tear induced laughs. This is a definite keeper for our family gatherings. Can't wait to play it again!

Family* fun card game (*may want to review cards for your family)
","

  Bought this for my family and then another for a friends' son's birthday because I thought they would really enjoy it, too. If Apples to Apples is too tame and Cards Against Humanity is too much for your family this is a great middle ground. As with CAH, you may want to review the cards prior to play to determine whether you think they are appropriate for your family and friends considering your personal opinions, age of players, etc. Simple game to pickup (especially if you've played either of the others mentioned). Can be played rather quickly or for quite some time if you want to make a night of it and not get bored. No expansion packs that I've seen but I'm sure if you wanted to you could mix in cards from other games or even make your own. Lots of fun!

  Bought this for my brother's family as they have 3 kids stuck in the house for the foreseeable future. It arrived early on a Sunday (way to go Amazon!) My s-i-l called last night and said it was a huge hit. Laughter to the point of tears, and fun for all the kids, 9, 10 and 13. She said lots of poop jokes, but they all loved it. Great stress relief, I'm sure. She described it as Cards Against Humanity for kids, which I also saw in the reviews, so probably a good description.

  Yes, this is a rip-off of cards against humanity, but one that works for and appeals to kids.

  Absolutely the best family game I’ve found for our family. We had family members between the ages of 4 to 65 loving this game!  I wanted a game to play with the entire family during thanksgiving. I was looking for something somewhat clean, and silly, but not too silly that the adults would hate it. EVERYONE loved it!  By the end of the night, my 8 yr old nephew loved it so much he was begging his parents to buy one for him.  And the next day, my 4.5 year old son was asking to play it again at breakfast.  It’s definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it to anyone with kids. The big cheese dance is genius.  I don’t know how this would work with 2-3 players, but it’s great with 4+ players especially of multiple ages.

  My 7 year old loves this game. She does need help playing it, since her reading isn’t on the same level as some of the cards. It gets lots of laughs and is very PG. The potty humor answers always get the biggest giggles. If you are an adult this game isn’t as hilarious or entertaining as Cards Against Humanity but this game is a good clean version. There are no expansions for it yet but I may buy a competitors version and combine them to get more variety as we. Have played several times and have almost gone through all the cards.

Fun Game - lots of poop
","

  This game is easy to learn--everyone understands the rules after just one round, which is why this game-play format is so popular. This is a fun game to play with younger school-age kids. They need to be able to read. Lots of poop and fart jokes are included. When we played with another family, kids over 12 weren't nearly as entertained as those aged 6-11. We went through beforehand and cleaned out a few ""inappropriate"" cards (this is standard practice in our house). With these cautions, I do recommend.

  My 9 yr old daughter likes the game. I personally think it could have been designed better. A lot of the answer cards don’t match well with the fill in the blanks. You have to alter the answer for it to make sense. There are blank cards for writing your own answer, which I guess helps with this situations but you don’t always have a blank card in your hand. I think they should also provide a dry erase marker for the blank cards. We don’t really play the game correctly  because you need 3 people. We just draw and take turns matching up questions and answers.

  Not only does it include an electronic banking system (which is faster and efficient) but the game's rules are modified. For example, there are no hotels, and each purchased property gets 1 house. The rent increases any time any player lands on the property. Instead of Chance & Community Chance Cards, there are Monopoly Cards (basically the same as the former) and Location spots that allow you to pay to move to any space on the board -- you can go to a property you want to buy, a property you own to increase the rent, or move to a space near Go so you will collect on the next turn.Whereas the original version took me and another player 2-3 hours to complete, this version took about 50 minutes on our very 1st time!I love this game and this version, and definitely recommend it. The rules are straightforward and the electronic banking system calculates everything for you.

  My kids (12 & 14) were so excited to get this game for Christmas.  I have to say that it has it's positives and negatives.Pros:* much, much quicker than the old game.  Takes about an hour to play.* much harder to 'cheat' as the computer does all the work for you.Cons:* Only 4 players* takes the learning of 'math/money' away from the player.* hard to tell who has the most money unless you are the 'banker'.  wish everyone had their own banking controller to see where each player is at financially.* when you 'mortgage' your properties to pay a debt to another player the other player automatically gets your property.  I  wish you can still hold on to it but just not collect 'rent' until you paid for it again. Or at least it should go back to the bank until someone lands on it to buy it.* Way too much work to keep track of how many houses are on each property at any given time.  The houses move as people roll the dice on the board.  Maybe there could be pegs in the board to keep them in place.* no more Railroads or Utility companies.* the player's ""bank cards"" are cardboard.  One of ours is already bent.  These really should be plastic as they are used for EVERYTHING!* you no longer have to buy houses for your property.  When anyone, including yourself, lands on a property that is owned it automatically increases the rent.Interesting concept but needs a lot of work.  I gave it 3 stars because my kids love playing this game.  I would have given it 1 star.

  A lot of fun but very different from regular monopoly. Games are much faster and you dont have to think about how much money you have or buying houses. The game automatically does it for you. In regular monopoly you need to own all the same color to build but this moves your property up levels regardless of how many people own the same color properties. We find ourselves playing the original monopoly much more often than this.

Very fun and a great addition to regular Monopoly.
","

  It took us a little bit to get used to how this game works. But, once we figured it all out, it was really fun to play! It's different than your standard Monopoly. But, the game moves along faster and you don't have to keep track of your money and such. It's really pretty fun! It doesn't replace standard Monopoly. But, it's a great addition.

Bad Version Do Not Buy!!!!!
","

  Hated this version!!! All the fun is lost when you have to futz around with the scanning device. We have played the other version with the credit cards but this one is different. The cards are cardboard and the game pieces are cheap plastic. There are only 4 game pieces which is weird. The scanning device screws up a lot which basically stops the game till you read the manual and try to solve the problem. Annoying. This version has no railroads or utilities either which is strange.The device ends the game for you which is not fun either. Basically a no go in my opinion.

Would like traditional Monopoly with some of these rules to shorten timeframe.
","

  I can't decide if I like this or not. On one hand the game plays much faster than traditional Monopoly, but on the other hand when playing with younger kids it hard to avoid confusion having to do everything through the handheld device. I think I'd prefer these rules to shorten traditional monopoly but with a manual/human banker. This seems like a novelty that wore off quickly the third or forth time we had to try and undo something on the handheld. At one point it froze up on us and so the game was just over...

This game is horrible
","

  I didn't mind that this game wasn't like the old Monopoly.  I thought it might be easier and fun to play with the bank card machine, but it was a mess. It was annoying to keep swiping the cards, and if you didn't do it in the right order it got all screwed up. Everything went downhill when we realized the machine wasn't keeping track of who owned what property, and I was VERY careful about which card I swiped when a property was purchased. The money wasn't right either. Payments for rent weren't showing up on the accounts. Also the houses fly everywhere if you're not careful with the dice because there is nothing to hold them down.  I thought this would be easier and more fun to play, but it just caused a lot of tears and frustration. I do not recommend this game.

Simplified, fun, and easy
","

  There are so many versions of Monopoly, and we always add a handful of house rules when we play...This version however, with the electronic bank that keeps track of each player's account as well as the cost of rent on each property, really simplifies the whole thing. You just tap the property card, then tap the player's credit card, and rent or purchase price is automatically deducted. The chance cards add some fun changes, plus there are location spaces on the board where you can pay to relocate anywhere on the board, which is very useful. There's no trading option (that we could tell) and we didn't have a chance to try the auction feature.All in all, it was fun, more simple than our usual Monopoly games, and I actually liked using the electronic gadget rather than paying ""cash"" and making change all the time. The little house pieces are completely wasted in this version, and should have just been left out since the electronic device keeps track of every property's price. A different marker system for the board would be useful, since the houses bounce around and don't stay where they're supposed to be.

Too modern not as fun as original
","

  This game was okay. The modern aspect of it with the banking card seemed cool which made me want to buy it but once I played it was confusing to figure out and I just felt the whole game I was just tapping my card on the unit rather than the original monopoly I'm used to where we exchange money and are more interactive and into the game with physical money. Taking away the physical money was a mistake. With this version it seemed a little boring as an adult and I didnt feel like I was actually playing a game with buying and selling property, rather just sitting back and tapping a card when it was my turn. It took the whole fun out of counting your money and buying property. Way too modern for me. Some games are supposed to be left as classics. Stick to the original if you ask me.

A faster game for Monopoly lovers...
","

  My kids are board game Fanatics... the problem is they like to play all hours of the day including right after I get home from work. 😧  I'm all for a good board game but traditional Monopoly game tends to be a 2-hour + game.  This is an introductory four player game with easy to follow instruction & traditional visual elements. What I like this version is the physical money is gone ( cuts down on the cheating!) clean up is a bit faster and its little bit more organized to set up (ALL THE LOST PIECES! 😭)Original Monopoly has been a little tricky for my 7 year old to understand.. he gets bored after about 30 minutes and I'm usually stuck finishing his side of the board. This version has a credit card to use  and is all electronic . There are some sound effects and he is very excited to swipe his card to collect his $200!  An average game Monopoly ultimate banking takes us about 45 minutes to an hour which is awesome when you're dealing with small children who have a short attention span. I definitely recommend this game for kids who are eager to play Monopoly but feel overwhelmed by the multiple pieces, money management as well as event cards. This levels the playing field for all players so that everybody feels like they have an even chance to win, not just the hardcore Monopoly strategist.

Faster, cooler, but only four players.
","

  So this is a pretty good game, and actually it doesn't seem to last as long as normal monopoly because when you land on a place you either have to buy it or auction it, the money is kept track of with the little computer card reader provided by the game.  It keeps track of everything, money, properties, how many houses on each property etc.  The cards are rather fun (no community chest cards, just chance cards) and when you scan the card(s) it does all the guesswork for you including taking money from one player in order to pay another player. The property rent prices are STEEP...for example if you land on Atlantic Ave, ( I think) and it has five houses on it, rent will set you back around $1300.  But don't worry about not having the money to pay, if you don't just scan your card and it will deduct the amount you owe the other player as well as you having to sell one of your properties to pay the difference.  It keeps track of who owns what properties, so there is no cheating when it comes to the bank and how much a player is supposed to pay, etc. There are no utilities or railroads, instead, there are 'location' spaces that enable you to pay $100 to move to any property in order to buy it.  Get out of jail now costs $100.  Overall it's a good game, the only thing I have a complaint about is that it is only a four-player game.  I was super disappointed when I saw that because we are a family of five so someone either has to sit out, or double up with another player.  Like I said, great game and I'm glad Monopoly has evolved from the initial game which last entirely too long.  It would be nice to have more players.  Another good Monopyly game is Monopoly Speed.  It literally last 10 minutes so you can play multiple times without getting too frustrated.

Should be called ""UN-Monopoly""
","

  Game moves quickly and electronic sounds are funny; however, there is no point to the houses and it doesn't make a difference if you have 1 or all of the properties of a particular color. Also, it's hard to keep track of how much money you have unless you constantly look at the electronic monitor. The 1-5 ""levels"" on each property should have ridges to hold the houses (just as markers) so you know which level rent the property is at and so the houses don't shift all over the board when you roll the dice or when anything moves.  It's fun, but not as fun as the original. Easier to play and less challenging. I just bought properties, sat back and collected rent as players landed on my property and as rent increased when I landed on my own property. There is also no ""free parking"" pot of money. The challenge cards are pretty funny.

  I purchased this monopoly board game for my ten year old daughter and I to play together.  I thought for her first monopoly a digital would be so much easier.  However; after messing with it several times I realized the instructions were not as easy as we thought.Once we finally learned how to use it, it became my daughter's favorite game.  She much rather play with this one than the original one which I also purchased after this one because we were struggling on how to figure out how to play it.  I think overall;  I recommend this item because once you get the hang of it you can play more than one round of game because it goes a lot faster than if you were to  play the regular traditional monopoly game.The machine that adds up each players money, properties etc is so convenient and easy to use now.  It keeps track of everyone money and therefore makes the game go by faster and accurately.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

bit of a learning curve but lots of fun.....
","

  There's a bit of a learning curve at first but once you get the hang of it, there is a lot of fun to be had. The family gathered around for a day of board games and this was one of the new ones we tried. I like the fact that the bank keeps track of everything. Each player is assigned a card and matching token, and once you start buying properties or paying rent to others the bank adds, subtracts, and keeps track of how much you're worth and which properties you own.  No more trying to calculate how much rent is owed or how much change to return. For those who like the paper, this might not be their cup of tea but I would still suggest giving it a try. My dad is 82yrs young, and an avid monopoly player from back in the day and even he loved it. Oh by the by, always remember to compare prices when you have the chance, I bought this here from Amazon.com because it was the best price compared to stores nearby.

Neat Idea, Too Many Steps

  I originally thought I was buying the original electronic banking version of Monopoly, but this game uses various cards that have different scan images that are used to scan on the infrared little scanner box that comes with the game. It is confusing at first but a great idea. I think there is still some work that needs to be done to improve this version of the game because it should be quick and not as complicated when playing the game. It is very easy to forget to switch a player when scanning a card to play and it ruins the whole excitement of getting good and bad community chest/chance cards between players.

Sharp bright colors, bank machine working well, bank cards seem sturdy, playing cards averagely so.

A great, quick, and streamlined version of Monopoly.
","

  There is a lot of fun to be had with this game if you are one of those casual Monopoly players that want a different way to play while also having a great electronic banking unit keep track of all your money and property values for you. But there are some rule changes to some of the core mechanics and other new stuff to be aware of.- You CANNOT trade properties with other players, unless game effects do otherwise.- When in jail, you DO NOT collect rent from others or raise the rent. It is a MANDATORY rule in this version.- There is no utilities or R.R.s in the game. There is a new go anywhere space if you pay 100. Doing this, you DO NOT pass GO.- Event cards replace community chest and chance cards. They vary in different effects.- No houses or hotels can be bought. Instead, you use a house on the property when purchased to track rent levels that increase from other players and even you landing on them. They also increase when all the properties of a color set is purchased, even if it's a split Monopoly. (Ex: Player 1 has two orange and player 2 just bought the 3rd orange. That will cause all the orange properties to go up one rent level. Two levels if it's a solo player monopoly.) and event cards that can also raise or even lower rent.- When in the negative, you sell your properties for face value to the player you owe money to. The rent level stays where it is. (If you owe the bank, it'll remove the rent tracker)- The game ends when ONE player goes bankrupt (indicated by a siren horn from the unit) and then totals up all player remaining money and property values. The highest amount is the winner.Pros- Banking unit is very easy and fun to use. Keeps track of everything really well.- No need for a banker. Everyone can be involved.- Less game components to worry about losing.- Plays quicker than a regular game of MonopolyCons- Device will need batteries (3 AAA) and a screw driver to remove the battery door.- Only up to 4 players instead of the usual up to 6.- Mover tokens are a cheap plastic.This version of Monopoly is really great for those who want to play a quicker game while an electronic device keeps track of everything for them in-game. So for the Monopoly purists, this is definitely not the version for you. But give it a try when you can. You may be surprised.

No more excuses to not play Monopoly
","

  I used to always say no to Monopoly. It is such a long game, someone's always whining about not having as much money as someone else, and someone has to do double duty and play banker. This iteration takes most of that out - the game usually doesn't take too long due to the nature of rent increasing just from landing on the space, you aren't constantly reminded visually that your sister has way more money than you, and the computer does the banking for you. There is a little bit of a learning curve - I still have to ask the kids which button to push for certain actions. It is a good conversation starter about how spending money via a card feels different than using cash and how we can lose track easily without a visual representation of how low our account it getting.

  While my grandsons (aged 10 and 12) loved the game, I felt all the financial thinking was taken out of the game.  The challenge of seeing cash accumulated.  I never once looked at how much money I had in the automated machine because it would tell me when I was broke.  In the ""cash"" Monopoly the fun was in watching the money and actually seeing yourself go broke.  I am sure it is a generational thing since nowadays plastic money is the way to go and no one uses cash.  Better to get Dave Ramsey's game which teaches a more financial side of things.

  This game was hilarious. We played it at a Thanksgiving gathering with 20 family members ranging in age from 7 to adults (no age necessary). We never laughed so loud and argued so much about who started singing first. We also argued about whether it was a song or not. Of course it was friendly arguing. There was one team that was doing the best due to my partners Dad, she was 7, but his partner was her grandpa and he was bragging about how well they were doing. She said to me, ""I don't think Grandpa should be bragging, my Dad is the one that knows all the songs"". Out of the mouths of babes. One comment is that we liked the Spontuneous cards so much we were using them more often, rather then just when you landed on the clef.

  Unlike most people, it seems, I have always enjoyed monopoly and it’s ability to bring out the worst in your friends and family. This version is great, too. Not only are you not cleaning up all of the money at the end, but the unit does everything for you. I played last night for the first time after it arrived (yesterday, as well) and it was the quickest game of monopoly I have ever played. Even with reading the instructions, it only took about an hour. For the weak of heart, this version is ruthless and I lost properties due to rent like four times. I would get ahead, then destroyed by rent again and it was a revolving door of “I've got this!” And “There’s no way I could win at this point” until I met my own demise after about six/eight rounds around go. If you’re on the edge, just buy the game. It’s totally worth it.

He got onto playing Monopoly with my wife and I (our youngest has now joined) and it has brought a lot of fun into playing games together.This was the next logical step for him, and I know he's going to love this as he has been asking constantly for it.Packaging was in great condition.Here's to many hours of fun!

  However, I must state my disappointment in the quality of the pieces.  The ""men"" and the card-swiper are made of pathetically cheap plastic.  One would think it would be simple to exchange the men for any other objects, but it isn't so simple in the high-tech version of the classic Monopoly game.  We'll see how long it lasts.  In the meantime, as i stated in my header, the kids are enjoying.

  This game is amazing! We play it almost every week for game night. It’s super simple to assemble and super easy to learn. Makes the whole paper cash a thing in the past. You can actually finish the game in one sitting instead of trying to count cash and figuring out who wins. The automatic teller tells you who wins and when someone goes bankrupt also notifies you. This product would be an amazing gift to gift to someone. Definitely gift able item. The board game definitely is thick like any other monopoly board games.

Barely thicker than cardstock...

  The actual game board is barely thicker than thick paper. Im not one to complain and write negative reviews. I purchased thinking it would be like the regular thick cardboard game board of my childhood. But they've gone cheap.

Not at all what I was expecting, expected a half way decent version, price should be a clue.

  I guess our expectations were a lot higher than they should have been. Saw the box and it was the same box as when we were kids except now it is so cheap. The board sits flat on the table so marbles will just roll off all the time. The board is made out of cardboard that is thinner than a cereal box and it is folded into quarters with a slit down half of it to fold better. This allows for the board to spread when trying to play allowing marbles to go all over the place.Spend the extra money and get a better version, not even worth attempting on this one.

The Board Is WRONG! This Is NOT Pahrcheesi, But A Bad Immitation!
","

  Besides being cheap and flimsy as other people have said (and the pieces are tiny), more importantly, THE BOARD IS DESIGNED INCORRECTLY; it shows incorrect Safety/Home zones -- and they're colored, so there's no mistaking that.Here's a link for the original board: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00134MJWE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1. I grew up with this very same board, which is great. LOOK AT THE IMAGE. The picture shows the yellow pieces in the Start zone. There's one yellow piece in the Safety zone, which is to the left of -- and AFTER -- the Start zone. That's the way the game's played!This game presumably has you only go three quarters of the way around the board, because the Safety/Home zone is BEFORE the Start zone.If you can afford it, spend the extra $14 on the REAL game. and disregard this one. You can always keep your eyes on the lookout for a used board....

They measure 1.72"" x .86"" x .23""  Good dominos - great for the price
","

  Actual dimensions are 1.72"" x .86"" x .23"", which is very slightly below (about 1/32 of an inch smaller) than1 3/4 x 7/8 x 1/4.  These are the only wooden dominos I've seen except for a set my parents have had since the 1970s.  Comparing these to those, the '70s set seem a little bit better, as my parents' are made from harder and heavier wood (almost feel like metal), with more defined engraving on both the front and back, and more clearly painted dots.  This Pressman set is more what I would expect a wooden domino to look like if I had never seen ""really good ones"" before.  And both sets are about the same size, which puts them in a tie for the smallest dominos I've ever used.  And if you want lightweight, these are very light.  The cardboard box is oversized (4"" x 6"" x 1 5/8"") - the dominos just rattle around in it loosely, which detracts from them being well suited for traveling.  You could pack the dominos neatly stacked into a box that is 3 1/2"" x 1 3/4"" x 1 1/4"".  If you made a box like that, this would be an awesome travel set or even a pocket-sized set, which is what I intend to do.  They're nice.  And they are consistent enough that I don't expect to be able to recognize specific dominos from the back unless I were to specifically try to learn that.  I feel nostalgic about them already and am very happy I bought them.

I don't know if this is the same brand of way back when but it sure does look like it. Nor do I know the price of back then. Oh and the Box is also made of a thinner cardboard as well. But it all good. This is our 2nd one like this because of moving and other people not respecting other ppls things. But we will enjoy this one with care just as much as we enjoyed the other one.

JUNK... Woodgrain Clings & Makes This Game Impossible

  The traditional pickup sticks from when I was a child were lightweight, thin, perfectly rounded, perfectly pointed plastic that was really fun to play because you could actually pick up the sticks without others moving. These “new and improved”, ahem, wooden sticks just simply don’t work. Regardless of how well-sanded and smooth they are, it is nearly impossible to pick any up without moving others because woodgrain clings to woodgrain. Mayyyyybe if they were much smaller and lighter weight they would work in wood, but these make the game impossible to play properly. Junk.

  I bought this item with plans to teach my children how to play checkers, chess, and backgammon. Because the price was so low, I will not be as upset when they inevitably lose pieces. The pieces are cheap plastic, but will easily serve their purpose. The board however leaves something to be desired. It is so thin, that I expect it to be torn after a very short period of time. The board appears to be thinner than standard poster board. Instruction page that comes with the game is fairly acceptable except for the backgammon instructions which are pretty vague. With all of this said, I still feel it will still work for teaching my children how to play all three games, and we will purchase another more durable and expensive set as the get older and more responsible.

  I was in NYC recently and visited a Greenwich Village boutique that had a wonderful wall tiled in dominoes. I was completely taken with the look, and decided then and there that I would do the same when I returned home to Tucson. After some experimentation, I chose black dominoes with white dots and began searching for the right ones for my project. To tile the backsplash area of my kitchen, I wanted to use double-nine dominoes for the variety it would produce in the pattern overall. When I began shopping around, I quickly discovered that many of the cheaper imports have no quality control and half the dominoes in any box were unusable, either because they were chipped or because of overprinting. I realized I should just head to Amazon, and found these Pressman dominoes which are absolutely fabulous. They are each the exact same size, and not a single one was overprinted in all the boxes I ordered! While I realize this may not be a traditional use for these game tiles, I couldn't be happier with the results!

  As a child pressman checker/chess/backgammon boards were all over.  They were good little starter sets and were made just as well as other kids games.  Alas this is no longer the case.  Here are my problems with it:- The box it comes in is to thin and it has those cardboard sharp edges.- The game board is way thinner than the old ones and seems like slightly thicker than poster board (like another reviewer said).  I looks like they printed a sheet with the squares on it and then glued it to the cardboard. Cheap, cheap.- The checkers are cheaper plastic and not as substantial.  They are easily knocked around.- The Chess pieces were ok and again not substantial so easily knocked over.  My set was incomplete. I was missing a black knight and had an extra bishop.- The board is not slippery so the pieces do not slide nicely.- The board and pieces are made in China.  Not that China makes all bad things, but it appears they bid this out to the Cheapest bidder and it shows.I normal do not write a lot of reviews, but if you are like me and remember the original pressman boards this will disappoint.Hope this helps

Very Flimsy Board
","

  My 9-year-old could not move without knocking other marbles over most of the time. The board was too flimsy for his spazzed out hands. While I never knocked any marbles loose, my 13-year occasionally did as well. Unless you have really steady hands, the marbles will roll when you move. It makes it hard to play on this board. Because he moved them almost every turn, I recycled the board after one game making the board a waste of money. As the marbles have some value, I did not rate this 1-star. These are not high quality marbles as expected given the price, so you'd be better off purchasing marbles separately and trying to get a better deal if you are only purchasing this for the marbles. If you are purchasing for the board, good luck. You're going to need it.

Whether you want to buy these will depend on what you want to use them for.Details:Size: Quite small, ~1.5"" x 1"" (they are slightly larger than this on both sides, but I don't remember the exact quarter/eighth amounts)Color: for all reasonable purposes, black. This is all right for me, though I would have preferred if the dominoes were the color pictured.Material: It might be wood? through the black paint/stain you can see what looks like wood grain, but they don't Feel like wood. Maybe that is just due to the paint (or what ever they used)?Quality: despite being small not quite as I pictured them these feel like they will be sturdy dominoes. I set them up and they all balanced fine and made a typical domino chain. They do have a quieter sound when falling, which is nice.Back: The back does have the pressman logo on it, so if you want a blank back these aren't for you.Overall: I like them.  They aren't as perfect as I would like, but they are $3.  If I wanted super nice ones I would have gone for the other wooden domino set that costs $30.

  Somehow I thought there'd be a third set of pieces for the backgammon board. It indicates the checkers pieces are for that, too. I suppose it does nicely about resourcefulness. Smaller and separate pieces would have suited me personally though since we have a different, little board collecting dust. Well, you win some...The chess pieces aren't too bad. A bit on the light plasticy side, functional though and are sized pretty well. They'll probably fall over if you're trying to play in a moving vehicle. Yet for a table game that you simply want to play or teach chess with and aren't worried about ""quality,"" this is for you. Also comes with checkers that do stack (woohoo!) and a pair of dice, plus a list of other games you could try with these pieces. For roughly ten dollars on technically three games to start, I'd say this is a nice deal.The board is durable so it is flimsy, but it's not completely flat either. Cosmetically, a whole corner had a line of white that looked like the paint was scraped off. I'll upload a picture when I get around to it.To recap, a perfectly fuctional chess, checkers and backgammon set. I like the color scheme. On the plus side of being cheap, you could play with this until your pocket is ready for a more 'solid' set.Can't complain. Nothing missing or broken on arrival.[edit 7/14/15 -- Cat keeps knocking down the game pieces when we leave it on the table. So we know now he jumps up there regularly during the night.

  I like the size of the sticks and my older granddaughter loves them. I would also heed the recommendation that this is not for younger children 3 and under...the sticks are very sharp and could literally cause a problem if poked in an eye or other body part.

  I bought this to use a cheap checkers/chess set to use with a kid I do autism therapy with. Obviously given the price this is a pretty bare-bones set (hollow plastic pieces, thin cardboard, etc.), but it gets the job done. The kid and I managed not to damage the board or pieces (and had fun!) so it'll probably work fine for you if you just need something cheap. Unlike other cheapo sets, this one is actually about the size of a normal checkers/chessboard. Great for broke public school teachers or people without the highest expectations.

  I wasn't sure if my wife would like backgammon so I wanted a cheap game to introduce her to it. This is perfect for that. It is a cheaply made game, but accomplishes the goal of learning the game.

Love everything about it... except the game itself
","

  This game was definitely made by fans.  The Delorean.  The Clocktower.  The fading picture.  It's all here.  Unfortunately this game is super swingy.  I've played plenty of difficult dice chuckers, from Elder Sign to Pathfinder Adventures, but this one seems exceptionally punishing.The game manual itself recommends that you spend early turns doing side objectives in order to build up extra powers for future turns.  Extra powers=more actions per turn.  The problem is, everything in the game (except for movement) is done with a dice roll and there is a 1/3 chance that you roll a Biff, which not only fails whatever it is you're doing, but also causes Biff to set you further behind.  So in the crucial first turns of the game you can complete challenges and gain 1 to 2 extra actions for future turns or you can fail the challenge, waste your turn, still be stuck with the starting 5 powers, have the trouble card messing up your game because you failed to clear it, AND have Biff set you further behind.Even fighting Biff is a dice roll, so if Biff is causing too much damage and you try to stop him, you can roll even more Biffs.  This can lead to a completely unwinnable situation within the first several turns. I had a two-player game where it ended with the love meter at -4 (the lowest it can go, you need 13-15 to win) AND the Delorean still in the starting space (we did get the 3 car parts at least).  That is not just losing the game, that is elderly grandpa fighting Mike Tyson levels of obliteration.  It was not even close.I've been trying out different house rules to figure out the best way to play it because the theme and components in the game are fantastic.  If you're a Back to the Future fan, pick this one up.  If you're looking for a good co-op game, try Horrified or Pandemic.

  I am a huge fan of both Back to the Future, and table top board gaming.  I am no stranger to games that are made out of an existing franchise.  Sometimes it is done very poorly, and sometimes it is done well.  This game does a good job!  When you turn a story into a game. You have to capture the essence, while not making it a boring game.  It can't be too word for word the movie, and it can't stray too far from the source material.It is clever to have Einstein and Jennifer join the group so you can have a 4 player game, and not have it restricted to 2 (Marty and Doc).  Unique abilities with each player make replay a must.  The randomness of the challenges, and perks you can acquire can really make the game a nail biter.  Our first play through it was down the wire.... and we lost!  I still had so much fun.  The board is a very cute representation of Hill Valley, even complete with pop up clocktower that doubles has a dice tower!!!! So well thought out.I love that as you continue to fail your main objectives, the iconic family photo begins to show Mary's family disappearing in a clever way.The components are nice, the Delorean is detailed, the character models are unique.  This game has a great art style that is it's own but pays a good homage to the artistic direction of the movies themselves.AND I CAN'T FORGET The rule book is disguised as the comic Tales from Space featured in the film!Even the board has a nice visual queue when opening for the first time as you get a nice shot of the flux capacitor.All in all this game is fun to play, follows the narrative well, and is a great cooperative experience for you and your friends/family.  Working together is what makes this game great!

  Bought this game as a gift for my husband for Father's Day. It was a BIG hit and we had such a fun time playing it as a family.It's cooperative, so you're all on the same team working together to get George & Lorraine to fall in love, the DeLorean fixed up and into position in time for lightning to strike at 10:04pm, all while dodging Biff and his gang who are out making trouble.It's super theme-tastic, and we were up on our feet shouting at the dice by the end of the game.

Requires house rules
","

  Theme alone is 5 stars. Combine that with excellent components (also 5 stars) and you really feel like you’re in the movie!Well you would feel like you’re in the movie if the film ended with Marty failing and disappearing out of existence in 1955. Gameplay is a 1 star. It is incredibly punishing for anyone that isn’t insanely lucky (which I’m not). The first play through (2 players) ended with the love meter at the starting spot, the delorean almost to Doc’s house (halfway to where it needs to be to win), and the only accomplishment being that we collected all 3 parts. Our second game (3 players) ended 3 rounds before the endgame when everyone quit because realistically there was no way to achieve a victory - we were just too far behind and every roll just set us back further. I don’t think this game was playtested for balance, and that is a shame because clearly a lot of time was spent on components and theme - it does such an amazing job of honoring the film.Without house rules this game just isn’t fun. We tested house rules like rerolling one biff, or when you acquire a power tile you can immediately use it, which helped the experience.I hope there is a second edition at some point with a rule adjustment, I love Back to the Future and good strategic co-ops, so I want to be able to love this game. Fingers crossed.

  What’s not to love about a Back to the Future themed board game? The components are fun, and although it may look daunting to infrequent board gamers because of all of the different pieces, it is not that complicated. We highly recommend the advice of the game makers - complete the opportunity challenges first thing.  You need the extra power tiles and items help, too.  Focus on the love meter and get it moving, and keep an eye on what is coming up on the time track.  It’s true that luck of the die plays a significant role, but efficiency in accomplishing the two main tasks (moving the love meter and moving the Delorean), rolling extra dice (for the wildcard lightning bolt), and active coordination and sharing power tokens in clutch moments, really help. We played three times and won each time, without resort to House rules.

Back to the Future in a Box!
","

  Sure, my headline is the most cliche, clickbaity thing you can think of. However, I truly feel transported into the movie when I am playing this game. This coop board game will get you and your friends and/or families high-fiving when you complete a challenge, but flipping the table when Biff comes over and messes you up.The lovely designers of Prospero Hall have knocked it out of the park with this one. I have played Jaws before and knew when I saw this new release that they would do the IP justice. I had just watched the movie a few weeks before playing the game so my Back to the Future fervor was at an all-time high.First off, the game is pretty simple to learn. Your character has several ""power tiles"" at the start which tell you what you can do on your turn. On all the starter ones, you can either move or use a dice in a ""challenge."" You'll be running around the board trying to gather parts for the Delorean and ensuring Lorraine and George stay in love before time runs out. What's not to love?Well, good ole Biff is running around trying to ruin your plans. And oh man, if you hated him in the movies, you'll hate him even more in this game. Everything you do, he is there ready to reverse anything you've done. Whenever you do a challenge which typically involves helping George and Lorraine or trying to pick up the parts, you can roll ""Biffs"" on the dice which will move him towards George and/or Lorraine. When he gets to their spot, he will drop their love on the love meter. You need to keep this high but he will be constantly lowering over and over again.I don't want to go over all the rules, but I'll say for the price, the components are really good. The art on the cards is not just movie stills, but instead are custom images made for the game. I haven't assembled the Clock Tower dice tower since I heard it is a little fragile, but everything else is great quality. Pick this up if you are a Back to the Future fan!

  In the last year 2 games have come out that have been affordable, kind of by the same people, and have become my favorite games. Horrified was the first and this is the second. The components are great, rules are explained well, game play is fun and easy to learn, and somehow they've made the theme come alive. The game has you allocating dice to challenges while avoiding Biff who is on the board and moves around trying to take away your progress.Note that this can be challenging, especially for people who do not play a lot of board games. IMO I still think that if you do fit into this category and find it difficult and you keep losing I would hang in there. I believe that the game is so sound and fun that even non-gamers wil get better at it and find winning doable.

  Neat game that captures the up and down edge of your seat type feeling which was constant throughout the movies.  The artwork is really great also.  Having watched the movie as a kid it was a neat little adventure “back in time”.My only beef, and thus the four star rating, was the poorly designed clock tower dice tower which is kind of a pain to set up and make use of due to poor design.  Midway through our first game we just stopped using it.  I guess at this price point some corner cutting is to be expected on a board game with this many components but it’s unfortunate something like that is ever noticeable.

Not only a good Back to the Future Game (finally) - but a great co-op game!

  This game is an absolute blast- let me tell you why.  First off- game is well designed with player powers- and power tiles that turn into dice rolls/allocation or other powers (like rerolling the dreaded Biff dice rolls- or more movement).  The game takes place in 1955- and the kitch-art is awesome- and the look and feel of the game just oozes with theme.  The four main characters to play as are Doc, Marty, Einstein, and Jennifer. (i know Jennifer & Einstein weren't really there in the film- but it works in the game)  They are all super different with asymmetrical powers- and each really lends themselves to securing victory by either moving the DeLorian, helping George and Lorraine fall in love, or scare Biff away.  Cool small opportunity cards pop up over the town- allowing you to level your character up- and the cards bring up some of the best moments in the movie!  This game is a 5/5 for me- but warning - it's not a cake walk! I've won only once out of five games- but when you win- it feels awesome.

  We love cooperative board games. And the theme of this game is a perfect fit for cooperative play. You work together to get George and Lorainne to fall in love and get the DeLorean to the starting spot before lightning strikes the Clock Tower. It's a dice rolling game, so there's an element of luck that makes every game turn out differently.The first time we played, we cruised to a victory. But the next time, we were failing everywhere. And it always has us wanting to play again.See our full review on The Board Game Family website.

  My spouse bought this version for the nostalgia factor. There's a big, screaming white notification on the right hand side of the box, letting you and everyone else within 25 feet know that this is ""Retro"". Hasbro can rest assured, even without the tacky badge, nobody will mistake this product was made before planned obsolescence was normalized.Yes, the tiles are wood, but as others have stated, the board is sub par. It's similar to a glossy magazine cover glued onto cardboard. Pretty standard for a new board game, but disappointing for a product you're spending a little more on for a tactile flashback. On opening, the graphics were already cracked at the center seam. There is no way this board could withstand more than 10 gentle opening and closings without cracking the seam to the point of it needing tape. The tiles are unvarnished with printed lettering. Not sure if that's a feature of the original version. The tile font doesn't look like what I remember as a kid--this version looks more like the lettering in the Agway logo, but thinner. But I may be misremembering.If you're avoiding more plastic in your life, this game is a good choice. But you're not gonna wow any Boomers on Christmas morning with this.

I ordered the retro set because I figured it would be compact and no frills but it came in a massive box and was just ridiculous. Very disappointed.

  The box is MUCH larger than it needs to be - bigger than the contents.  Letter tiles are thinner and smaller than they should be, don't fit the board right - the company is saving money where they shouldn't.  Make the box smaller.!!At least the price is right.  I would rather pay another couple bucks to match the way it was originally marketed.  We had a set when I was a kid, tiles fit the layout beautifully, felt substantial in the hand.

Caveat Emptor

  ""Let the buyer beware""  it's my own fault for not looking at the reviews before buying this . This ""retro"" version is weak tea to the original at its best - as mentioned by many others, the board is flimsy, the tiles are out of very cheap wood, the font is TOTALLY WRONG, and the tile holders ?  None of classic appearance of the originals. The only thing similar was the color of the box  ... and it, too, was sub par.  I'm keeping it as a reminder to ""look before I buy.""

Massive Price Spike
","

  I purchased this very version of Scrabble (1949 Retro Edition) from Amazon for $19 in November 2019 on a whim. Today (3/31/20) I just was looking to purchase another set for my mom, who lives across the country so that we can play remotely, while both in COVID-19 lock-down. I was shocked and not surprised (in hindsight) to see the price had more than doubled with a range from about $45 to $65 for a single copy, as this has suddenly become a high demand item as so many of us are home bound.  Crazy times.  Wishing you all good health and spirits as we work through this global crisis.

Nothing Retro About This

  In 1949, games like this were Made in America, by American workers. The tiles and racks were solid wood, with a good heft to them. The board was sturdy and made to last.This ""Retro"" edition is none of that. Made in China, and everything looks and feels cheap. My forty year old Scrabble set still looks good. In five years, this piece of junk will have fallen apart and be in a landfill.Very disappointing. If you expect ""Retro' to signify craftsmanship and quality, you won't find it here. Find the cheapest set you can. Don't waste your money on something pretending to be better.

Classic Scrabble with some Quality Issues

  There's not a lot one can say about ""Scrabble"" in general - it's a great game which has been around for ages.I bought this particular edition for the ""retro"" aspect.  Unfortunately, quality control is evidently not a priority.  The letter tiles are not uniform, and the game board itself feels as if it will not last very long (folding and unfolding). A big deal? Not really, but it does detract from the experience.

  The tiles with the letters were not 'finished' with a coating.  A lot of the game is the 'feel' of the tiles.  With no coating on the pieces, some of the game action of smooth feeling tiles is 'missing'.  That may sound silly but it's a part of Scrabble!  Advertised as a 'retro'  version, the expectation was finished tiles like the retro version had.

this math teacher recommends
","

  For what it's worth, I have a B.S. in pure mathematics, a fellowship with Math for America, and I've been a high school math teacher since 2000.I see many parents doing flash cards and workbooks with their child and it makes me a little sad. We all want our children to be mathematically proficient because we know how many doors it opens for their future. However, unless your kid loves flash cards and worksheets, I would try to introduce more mathematical play to them. After all, math is as much an art as it is a science and--towards that end--it's important that they see the connections in math. This game allows them to do that, as well as see some of the visual patterns amongst one- and two-digit products.If you like this game and are looking for other math games, I recommend Prime Climb (for ages 7 - 13, but it's fun for adults, too) and Tiny Polka Dots (for ages 2-9).  If you're looking for other board games that have math, but are more game-y than math-y, I strongly recommend Santorini (similar to chess, but my kids like it way more) and Stone Age (great for teaching division; also, just a great board game).

  Perfect scrabble game. No more worn out boxes to deal with. Has everything I wanted and more. Excellent quality, love that everything is stored into one piece & perfect for traveling. I included pics below to show everything you get and how easily everything stows away. I also included the fold to show the quality of the strap. It's very sturdy and feels strong when opening and closing. It stays closed without a clip-it's that strong-yet not so strong that it's hard to open. Love that the letters nestle into each square on the board so if someone bangs into the board, they'll stay in place. Of course the turntable is an amazing feature, but it's also on wheels so if you need to pass the board to the other end of the table, it's no problem. I highly recommend this version of scrabble!

  I purchased this game for a family get-together. When the players had assembled around the table someone suggested counting the tiles, before beginning the competition. I opened the SEALED plastic bag that the tiles came in and found one ""I"" and one ""E"" missing. This is ironic given that the trademark on the box is ""Every Letter Counts."" I ran out to a local store and purchased a less expensive edition, if you call $18.99 less expensive, and cannibalized its bag of tiles. It was an expensive competition, at least for me.

  Forget about looking at the board upside down or getting the tiles shifted when you are trying to rotate your regular game board! This edition solved the problem!! We usually sit at our kitchen table that is made out of slate with a rustic wood panel across the middle section when playing this game as a family. You can imagine the table’s surface is very uneven. However, this game board rotates on this very uneven surface perfectly! And I absolutely love how each tile sits in its little slot now, so the tiles don’t need to be realigned. I’m a little OCD and it bothers me if you put your tiles down and don’t align them perfectly on regular flat game boards ;) This board won’t let you do that! Also, the little drawers on both sides are very functional.I’ve read other buyers’ reviews about poor quality of tiles. Well, there’s no difference between the quality of these tiles and the quality of other inexpensive versions of Scrabble tiles. Unless you’re used to buying $200+ Scrabble game boards, the tile quality won’t be a problem for you ;)

Count your blank tiles before starting.

  My family loves playing Scrabble.  Having the board turn and the tiles protected from slipping out of place is great.  The reason this receives four stars instead of five is that the wooden tiles are not of the same quality of earlier Scrabble games (they miss the varnish).  We learned as we played our first game with the Deluxe Edition that we'd been give extra blank tiles.  This worked to my advantage (we didn't check the tiles ahead of time) in our first family game as I kept drawing blanks.  Finally my daughter-in-law counted the number of words on the board with blanks, there were five.

  I have played Scrabble since I was a kid, but sadly, a few years ago, my old set got ruined (I was taking it to Speech Therapy patients in my car - the box got ripped, tiles lost, etc.). I had some friends coming over who wanted to play Scrabble and I had enough points on my amazon.com rewards card to get this for ""free!"" It is AWESOME! First of all, it has it's own all-in-one carrying case with a handle - no box that's going to be crushed. Two drawers slide underneath the board to contain your tile holders and tiles. The wheels underneath the board work seamlessly to turn the board with ease. The interlocking (raised) board keeps all of your tiles in place! It is awesome! The only negative I can see is that the tiles aren't made of that nice heavier, wood that they were made of in the past, but that's not a huge thing and definitely won't keep me from playing. I say this is SO worth the extra money to get this set over the traditional set! Oh, and I WON! ;)

I didn't realize that the squares on the boards were recessed so the tiles STAY PUT and won't move even when the board is bumped.  That, right there, gave it the five stars.  LOVE that feature.The rest is also 5 star worthy.  The soft bag to keep the tiles in has drawstrings to help keep it closed, and the two storage bays underneath have plenty of room for the holders and the tiles, as well as things you may want to keep to track scores.It folds up easily, sits flat when opened, and even has small wheels on the bottom so you can spin it around so whoever wants can see everything ""right side up.""Best Scrabble board I've ever seen.

Great Game Board, but the tiles ruined it for me!! Do NOT give this as a gift!

  This is a terrific game board! I wanted an extra scrabble game to keep at a second location and this looked like a good deal. I love how the tiles stay in place when you turn it to the other player or back to yourself. It has built-in wheels that help it swivel and raised ridges so the tiles don't slip out of place. I hate it with a regular board how the letters slip and slide around when you turn the board, or even place a tile where it touches another tile and they both shoot off at an angle. And it folds up nicely for traveling.What irritated me no end was how shoddy was the printing on the tiles! Given such a great game board, and a medium premium price, you would kind of expect the tiles to be of a certain minimum quality. Now I read the evaluations that mentioned this, but I figured how bad could it be? In reality, and maybe it's just my personality, but when a tile is printed so the bottom half of the letter is on the top part and the top part of the letter is on the bottom part, it is quite distracting. I finally spent about $12 bucks to order a set of tiles separately from another vendor.Given how great the board was, and how disturbing the tiles were, I would have been better served by upgrading further to a more expensive set. However, if you are willing to buy this set for the game board, and willing to use your old tiles or order a new set of tiles separately, it's a good deal. For me, I regret it. Too much effort! And certainly NOT something I'd ever give as a gift!

  Well I've been wanting one of these for years... Initially I thought the tiles would be locked into the squares on the board and secured so it wouldn't fall off even if it were turn upside down but that's not the case . The board secures the tiles  but they can still fall off.  I like that it has the two drawers at the side to hold the bag with the tiles and the racks so yo have a lesser chance of misplacing and losing them. The quality of the board is top notch too and I was fortunate to get all my racks and all my tiles. Finally, there's I a lil bonus piece of literature that i think is very useful and that is the pamphlet that comes in the drawers with all the playable two letter words. That is truly a gift.

  So you may have noticed there's a Scrabble Diamond Anniversary Edition, and then there's this Amazon-exclusive Scrabble Deluxe Edition which, I might add, is WAY better than the current ""Deluxe"" edition in brick-and-mortar stores. But you may ask ""What's the difference between this Deluxe and the Diamond Anniversary Edition?"" and that's a really, really good question.The answer is: Not much.In fact, if you press the stickers on the sides down a bit you'll see that the plastic on this board actually has the logo for the Scrabble Diamond Anniversary Edition embossed into it, with a Scrabble Deluxe sticker pasted over the top of it to hide the previous branding. Yes, kids, this is a Scrabble Diamond board with new stickers.What else is different? The tiles. In the Diamond Anniversary Edition the tiles are black with silver letters embossed into them. In this set, the standard wooden tiles from classic Scrabble are in play. The wood tiles are *slightly* smaller than the black ones, so they sit in the grooves on the board just a little bit less snugly than the black tiles that this board was designed for, but not so much that it noticeable or a problem if you've never played the Diamond version.The racks are the same curved red rack from the Diamond version. The bag is a standard felt-like bag. The manual's actually pretty nice and detailed with some great information, variations on play, and suggestions.So basically, Hasbro mass-produced the Diamond Anniversary edition, and made a deal with Amazon to sell this version as a ""lesser"" model for a lower price, but the only thing ""lesser"" about it is the tiles. If you're really a stickler for a complete Diamond experience, I suppose you could buy some black and silver tiles separately for another fifteen bucks, but I don't see the need.I had the Diamond Anniversary Edition (lost it, though) and I have this Scrabble Deluxe Amazon Exclusive edition,  and I'm here to tell you that if you're spending over a hundred bucks for a Diamond set, you're either a crazy collector, or easily duped into paying way more for nearly the same thing. This IS the Diamond board with a sticker on it.So how does it play? It's a great Scrabble set. The board spins by way of some wheels on the bottom (no, not a turntable, actual little wheels) and it's a smooth experience that makes game play easier for everyone around the table (though it likely won't spin on carpet.)  The whole thing folds up for storage, with two plastic trays built in to hold the racks, scorepads, pencils, tiles, bag, and manual (scorepad sold separately, of course.)It's pretty easy to carry around, though I wouldn't call it totally ""travel"" sized. I wouldn't try to play in a car unless it was a very smooth-riding vehicle and the road had no chance of bumps. For travel it's best to have a magnetic set, which this is not. But for bringing along to places where you have a stable surface to play? Yeah, it's pretty handy.Bottom line: This is the Scrabble set to get if you want a turntable, don't want to spend a hundred bucks, and don't particularly care if the tiles are special limited-edition colors. This will do just fine.Five stars, no question.Update: As another reviewer notes, the tiles with this set are a bit lower quality than the tiles with the standard set. They're perfectly usable. They are all present (in my set, anyway) and the letters and numbers are legible. If you don't like them the easy solution is to swap your tiles from your previous standard edition (come on, you know you had one before buying a Deluxe edition!) or buy another set separately. They're inexpensive. However, I see no reason why most people wouldn't be perfectly happy with the tiles included with this set.

Glad that I read the reviews

  This version is a really good value in build and design. The board: folds in half and is sturdy with very good attention to detail in design and colors. Definitely a better option than a new flimsy board. Plastic yes but sturdy. The tiles remain in place. And you can turn the board. Retro colors are 50/60/70’s at least to me. Hold off on getting extra tiles, ref other comments as you want to see the board in real life first and perhaps choosing or not another color besides natural. The tiles in mine, I do not see as stated in reviews, any defects. Hard case for carry, if you don’t like this, I still think the play board itself is really nicely done with this choice. Glad I read the reviews about the newer one and the retro 1940’s one too. We are inclined to find used games in very good condition for build quality and nostalgia. Other new nostalgia versions are too expensive and do not have the same build quality of older versions. This version is a really good choice for a retro looking one attention to detail and the tiles stay in place. Happy Gaming!

  The tiles are uneven sizes, the board is pretty crappy quality...but we do enjoy being able to swivel the board around and store tiles in the little drawer.

  This would be perfect except for one very important thing. The double and triple letters and word colors are the wrong colors!!! This is so important! When you're planning your strategy and you think that you're getting triple for a letter or a word -you discover that they haven't adhered to the regular approved colors and hues for these squares. This happens often until you get used to the coloring of the tiles. Please go back to the regular colors for others who buy this game.

Once you have played with a board like this that keeps the tiles in place, you won't want to go back!
","

  I used to own the deluxe anniversary edition, which I loved. I lost it in a move and have missed it ever since, until I found this version. I had been searching for an affordable version to rival the edition I lost, and this is it, hands-down. The separation between rows keeps the tiles from going everywhere and you absolutely won't regret the extra $$$ for that benefit alone. The rotating board is wonderful for those who like to see the words from their perspective. You do need a smooth surface for the wheels to rotate the board. I like how it folds for storage, which the deluxe edition did not do, as it was more of a display piece. Next to the very pricey alternatives which are made mostly from wood and look a bit more high-end than plastic, this is your best bet for the added features. We really love it, from the preteens to the grandparents and the beginners to the experts!

More fun than I remember
","

  I initially ordered this for my classroom but we ended up keeping it for ourselves! My mom was always a ginormous scrabble fan and I thought, I'm going to get this for my students because it's spelling practice in a fun way plus you use all kinds of brain power coming up with word combinations. I got the deluxe version because it has those grooves so pieces can't slip around. My only complaint is that this game looks a little tacky. I think the one my mom used to have wasn't as plasticy looking. And that gripe is only because this game stayed in our home and  we are not giant fans of bright plastic. If this had made it to my classroom it would have fit right in :) anywho get scrabble you guys! It's fun for family game night and it sneaks learning in there too.

This is the One!
","

  Bought our first Scrabble game back in the 70's; we used it fairly often through the years.  Never really liked the fact that if you bumped the board the letters would skew. Fast forward to 2019.  Finally decided we'd had enough; I started looking at the alternative setups.  While the travel version had the raised lines to keep the pieces in place, it was too small for our tastes.  Then I spied this one.  BINGO!  It has wheels to let you rotate the board.  It has 2 drawers: one for the ""letter sock"" and one for the 4 letter ""trays"".  My wife likes the old wooden letter holders and I prefer the new curved ones, so we swapped out 2 from the old game then gave it to a young married couple.  They are teachers and are loving it.  Just keep in mind that the board can rotate; keep your beverages and letter holders out of the way.

  Tiles are crap. Letters do not align, which drives me nuts. Wood quality is balsa like, rough and unfinished. Stamped, not embossed.

Glad I Purchased It
","

  Was hesitant to purchase due to some negative reviews about quality. Comes in a plain brown box. No quality control issues with my board or tiles. All the tiles were present in the correct amounts. All easily readable with some minimal variances from one tile to the other. The letters are printed on the tiles, not etched into the tiles. The board is solid and turns on its wheels easily. The two drawers stay closed when turning or carrying the board (which folds in half, play side in). Easily carried. Room in the drawers for the tiles, the rules, the stands, and enough room left over for a small pocket pad of paper and a pencil. Glad I purchased it.

  A must have! I love that the case itself opens into the actual playing board and each letter fits in a groove to prevent shifting. The hide away drawers to store letters and chairs in between games are also a plus for me.  As well as the wheels on the bottom.  This allows each player to spin and view the board from different angles.  So happy with my purchase.

Great implementation of a classic game!
","

  This is a great packaging and implementation of classic Scrabble. I love the design of the board.  It is ""gridded"" with ridges to hold the tiles in place, which is great for locations where there are vibrations (think boat/car/RV). The drawers are very handy for storage, and my favorite feature - the wheels! The entire board, when placed on a hard, flat surface, will rotate easily on the built-in wheels. This is great for passing the turn to the next person and allowing them to read the board head-on. When unfolded, the board is stable and can be picked up on one half without the second half overextending and folding down. The board opens and closes easily, but stays closed when it needs to and there's a built-in handle for carrying. My one complaint, but barely worth mentioning is that it is a bit bulky. Not great for travelling on a plane/train, but great for RVs, boats, or just going over to a friend's house for a game.

  Build quality is not great.  I can see this breaking if dropped once.  However, the board is nice.  The chip inlays make it nice and clean rather than the chips being everywhere and constantly fixing them.  The trays are cheap just like the board, but they are curved.  Overall this is maybe a 15.00 product, but the concept is nice.  They are definitely ripping people off on price.  I would not buy this again or recommend it, unless they dropped the price.  I’m taking stars because the build quality is horrible considering the price point.

Great Scrabble Board

  My 11 year old daughter started playing Scrabble at school. She loved the game and asked to get one at home. I wanted one where the letters would stay in place.  I remember the boards of my youth and one small bump sent everything sprawling across the board.  This has the spaces for the letters to remain in place. The storage areas for the letters and individual player letter holders is a plus.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is for the quality of the board, the trays for the letters aren't as high a quality.  The 'old school' wooden trays were better.

  I ordered this for my daughter as a surprise after she started playing scrabble last week in the cabin we stayed at for vacation. Ordered it so she would have it the day after we got home. It arrived today and we immediately opened it only to find that there was a “N” tile tapped to the outside of the plastic bag all the tiles were in. The “N” tile has a corner broken off and it was taped to the bag to keep it together. I got out counted all the letters hoping it was just an extra piece for some reason but it wasn't. So now if anyone draws that tile everyone will automatically know that person has a “N.”

  I bought this set for my mom and she absolutely loves it! All loose pieces fit nicely in the compartments under the board. The rollers make it perfect for multiple players and when finished, it folds in the middle providing handles to carry it without loosing any pieces. The letters on the tiles are bold and easily read. Small grooves in the board keep the tiles in place. A felt bag holds the tiles which helps when table space is limited. I choose this over the wood set because of the negative reviews and it was a lot less expensive. Would definitely buy again.

  I noticed that this was recently updated and the newer version had mixed reviews to say the least.  I chose to buy this version, the older design and find it to be perfect for us.  The board is well built with a sturdy hinge system as well as conveniently mounted drawers to hold the tiles and tile holders.  It folds up to a small enough size to make it easy to pack for trips away from home without sacrificing precious cargo space.  The tiles are digitally printed so yes they could be improved as they may fade over time, but for now they will do.  I'll say recommended for 50 points.

Tiles kept in place, but when board rotates, it will knock over tile racks at natural distance.
","

  One major flaw is that the natural distance the tile racks are placed near the board, where you think rotation will not knock them over... is actually too close.  It's just a really bad design flaw that wasn't needed.  Further, the clips that hold the contents on both sides of the board don't hold until they are slid all the way in... when you think it is hinging on, it is not, and you'll let go and it will drop.  It is really, really bad design.  In both cases, it signals that you can act in one way, to be slapped in the face later.  Functionally, everything works, but it's not elegant by any means.

  Really there isn't anything NOT to like. It's an old school Scrabble board incorporated into a 21st century kit style, ready-to-play board that stores all the necessary pieces, rotates, and secures the tiles in place inside the slots on the board.If I were to gripe about anything, it would be the price, or perhaps the plastic tile holders---indeed the entire plastic case/board. But if people are paying it (including myself), it must be worth it! It's certainly better than a cardboard box and board that wears over time.If you like Scrabble, this is the version to get!

Light and easy to carry.

  Case is light and easy to carry, uncumbersome. Love that you can carry it anywhere and it keeps everything orderly inside the little drawers.  Just two things I'm not crazy about.  First, the red plastic racks are plastic and a bit short, which are perfect if you play with 7 tiles, but if you also like to play with 9 tiles, the racks are too short.  Also, the bag that holds the tiles.  It's a a bit small and the fabric is thick and rough so it does does not close properly when you pull the cord, so the tiles tend to fall out of the bag.  The bag also does not have Scrabble printed on it, which tends to be a nice touch.

Very nice scrabble game. Liked it so much I bought a second one.
","

  This is a very nice design for this scrabble game (ASIN: B00JMCJGZC model # 16807F01). The board is hinged in the center and folds open to play. Since there are so many other reviews about it here on Amazon I'm not going to go into a lot of details about it. I will say that it really spins smoothly on the wheels built into the bottom and when folded open to play the board is even and works well. The tiles drop into ridged spaces for them so they don't move around when the board is bumped or rotated. It all folds up into a neat package when done with the tiles and tile holders going into two drawers on the sides of the board. It was a present for my grandson. I liked it so much I just ordered a second for my wife and I.The main reason I'm reviewing it at all with so many other reviews already here is to warn others about a similar version that is absolutely terrible.Do not be fooled by the ""there is a newer version of this game"" which points to the ""Scrabble Deluxe Edition Game"" in a red box ASIN: B00IFWSO94 Model# A8769 also by Hasbro. That version looks very much like this one BUT the board is two separate halves that ""fit"" together. It is also supposed to rotate and lock the tiles BUT the rotation is poor. The two halves don't line up properly with one half slightly higher than the other and in the one I got both halves were bowed. One bowed concave and one convex. What a mess. I had to return it (and was only given store credit...grrrr). In fairness I did NOT get that one at Amazon (why not is a very long story for another time).

  This set is compact, with all of the necessary parts (tiles,holders) stored inside the frame of the board. It works well on a flat surface and is easy to rotate. The tile squares are recessed to hold the tiles in place.  It's a bit too big to use in a vehicle unless you have an RV and it must be placed on a flat surface if you want to be able to rotate it.  Also, the tiles can fall  out if it is bumped hard enough.  But for home or indoor use it is a great way to play Scrabble without having the tiles slide around.

Each turn you need to move, battle, use some items, and make the dungeon with APs (Action Points).My most favourite thing to do is (drum roll please) SLAYING MONSTERS!!!!!! My fave item is The Blade Of Death. I created The Blade Of Death (NOT with The Ring Of Creation LOL) with the spare item tiles. Spare item tiles are tiles to replace worn-out items/monsters or… create your own! If The Blade Of Death is your only item +6 to battle roll. If it is your last item (inventory full) +11 to battle roll.I wouldn’t change anything about the game. I love the game as it is so there is nothing I don`t like. It`s a good game because…you…can…kill…a…DRAGON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!- S. aged 7 &11/12

  I bought this game mainly for a one player dungeon crawler game. Once I saw the free extras you can get from the gunpowder studios; extra characters, magic items etc I thought the price reflected what I was getting and I wasn’t disappointed, the game is easy to play yet can be challenging and there are extra quests on scrolls to use where you have to rescue someone, escape the flood and there are 8 others.Best thing is that it doesn’t take long to set up and the game won’t take too long to play. I’ve enjoyed using my old Heroquest character figures and I love the mixture of monsters which you fight as you pull them out of the bag.

  Such an easy game to get into and a lot of fun. Wander in and explore, collect loot and get out if you can get past the dragon who wants his ring back. You can solo it, co-op or all for yourself. Good bit of fun and great for kids getting into board games like my 10 year old son.Some newer rules online at the makers website which explains a few little things better but apart from that a good game.

Fun family game

  I have 2 kids who have the mental capacity play this game....relatively...a 9 and a 6 year old.  While, at least one of them, aren't great at forming new words with the letters given, with some help, he does a pretty good job overall.  It's a great little game to play as a family and I like how they can stack tiles and change the words without always having to add new words.  My only qualm (and this goes for most games in general) is you would think the game would fit back into the box right?  Well, it does but it's a bit bulky and the lid doesn't go on all the way.  If the box was made like an inch or 2 thicker, it would t be a problem.  Otherwise, great game!

  I was hesitant to get a newer version vs. jumping on eBay and getting an old one from the 80s/90s (whenever it was).

Tiles Hard to Stack
","

  My husband and I have been playing almost daily games of upwards for more than 25 years.  I wanted to replace the tiles since the letters have become hard to read after repeated use (and sometimes washing).  Unfortunately, the version that was the same large tile design as our current set only had 64 tiles rather than 100.  I got this 100-piece set not only because of the quantity of tiles, but because they were described as interlocking.  Unfortunately, the tiles are small and really hard to stack because they have four small pegs which have it fit into holes.  The stack of five tiles tips over frequently while trying to fit the pegs into the holes.

Love the game...but cheaply made
","

  I’ve enjoyed playing this game for years, and wish I had the old version of it bcuz it was made better. My dislike is totally cosmetic; and I admittedly have a low tolerance for this.  The board is supposed to spin somewhat like a lazy Susan however, it’s cheap plastic and is more than I want to tolerate. I put the board on an actual spinning lazy Susan. The Upwords label on the face of the game, popped out almost immediately. I glued it in and it came out again...leaves a hole open in the box if you can’t make it stick. I finally used shipping tape to keep it in place.

  This game has a ton of potential to be fun but they didn't really invest in making the board scoring interesting, like scrabble and the board is too small for challenging words.  And this thing is sooooo cheaply made that you spend half your time just trying to keep the tiles on the board and turn the thing without everything flying off.  The plastic is very, very thin and cheesy.  It has a ton of potential but they should have invested more quality in the product and made it more expensive rather than to cheap it out.  I wouldn't buy again and I'm not sure we'll be playing it much.

  I used to play this gave over 20 years ago and have talked about buying it again for a long time and finally did. The game itself is great and super fun. We are Scrabble players so this is a nice change. The turntable and game board is kind of cheaply made. For anyone who had the original this is no where near as high quality. The biggest complaint I have is tiles of letters that look the same when your change the orientation are not marked. For example M and W or N and Z. You cannot tell them apart so we had to mark ourselves. The game itself is very fun and for $17 well worth the hours of play you get out of it.

Feels a bit cheap, but still plays well

  I picked this up for my kids to help learn to spell. My wife and I used to play the actual game regularly and our old one was missing a bunch of the letters.This is a new design and I am mixed. It is nice to have a rotating board, but it feels a little cheap. It hasn't broken yet, but it feels like it might break fairly easily.I liked the older design of letter fully covering the previous letter instead of this model of setting a letter on top. This works fine but you have seat the letters a bit more carefully than the older design.

Rotating Board is a great update on the classic
","

   I grew up playing Upwords in the early 90s. We had an old grey board. I remember we always had to carefully slide it to the next player to avoid the tiles falling down.This new updated version of Upwords fixes the problem of falling tiles for shaky hands and makes it easy to rotate the board. The tiles have perfect sized holes to sit on top of each other and not slide off. The lazy susan spinner on the bottom of the board works as well as a plastic spinner can. Sometimes it requires two fingers to spin (one to hold the base and one to spin), but most of the time you can spin it with just a flick of one finger.I wish the box was just a little big bigger. When you store it away, you have to disassemble the spinner from the board, turn it upside down, and then put all the tile holders and pieces in it. If you pack the board away as is, the box won’t close all the way. It’s not a deal breaker as that only takes less than a minute to do.Overall, I definitely recommend this for fans of word games.

Fantastic word game
","

  My family absolutely loves playing Upwords. It is a cool spin on the game Scrabble allowing you to build words up, which means the words are ever-changing and growing upwords. It is fun and easy to play. My only critiques are minor. Instead of a nice drawstring bag for the letters, they give you a plastic Ziploc type bag. Also, some of the letters look very similar and it hard to differentiate between them (such as Z & N or C & U). If it weren't for these minor things, this game would easily earn a 5-star rating from my family. It is a game we will be playing again and again. It'll be a big hit for a logophile (word lover).

Classic family tabletop game for word nerds. A fun way for scrabble lovers to mix things up.
","

  As a lifelong  Scrabble player who hadn’t played UPWORDS since childhood, I was excited to try it out again with my daughter. While it’s still a little advanced for my first-grader, I think she’ll be good to go by the end of the school year.If you’re a Scrabble player playing with non scrabble players, you’ll probably need to take it easy on the two-letter Scrabble-centric words to keep the play fun and competitive. If you’re playing with another Scrabble player, play is double fun because you can really stack up the points with parallel plays. It’s hard to let go of the idea of premium tiles, though! But I love expanding my options instead of being constrained by the existing game board. It’s really fun!There’s even a solo variation if you want a real life word game solitaire.The board has a sort of lazy susan apparatus that locks in place at each quarter turn, fine if you’re playing with 3 or 4 players, but annoying with two, as it jostles the tiles if you turn it at all forcefully past the click. And the little plastic novelty UPWORDS logo thing pops out of the box almost immediately, so either tape it in or count on losing it and having a rack-sized hole in the box.

LOVE the new and improved board and tiles
","

  We are word nerds and already had three copies of Upwords when this came up to review, and I was about to skip over it when I noticed that it has a new rotating board.  I had to try out the new board.The rotating board is great.  It doesn't have a lazy susan underneath the main board, but it functions in a similar manner.  The board easily spins, and it locks down in the four cardinal positions.The tiles have been updated as well.  Instead of having a groove around the edge of each of the letter tiles to allow stacking, now the tiles have four little divots on top of the tiles and four little posts on the bottoms of the tiles.  Tiles can still get knocked over, but it doesn't happen as much as it does with the original style tiles.The new improved board is amazing.  We haven't played Upwords in years, and since getting this new board this week we have played the game about five times.

  Pro:- Fairly easy to learn the basics, though some of the scoring can take a bit to get used to- Immediately appeals to scrabble fans (and there are a lot of us!)- Individual tile holders are well-made- The ziploc bag to store the tiles in is a nice touch- And thumbs up on the lazy-susan functionality of the boardCons:- A great many of the pieces have unpleasantly sharp edges (""Ow!""); it's clear these were cheaply manufactured and/or cut.  Be prepared to trim or sand down the sharp nubs :(.- Some letters can be challenging to disambiguate, particularly the N vs. Z.- Instructions provide helpful examples, but could use some wordsmithing / optimizing to make things more clear.

The best chess set of this type and price range on amazon.
","

  I've been trying to find a Chess set that is a balance of good quality and a good size for a while.  It seemed either there was only cheap junk out there or really expensive kits.  After many pages of amazon searches, ebay searches and review reading i settled on this kit.It's nicely sized and the pieces are great quality with nicely carved features.  The board is also good quality with a solid locking mechanism for when the unit is stored.The only con i can think of is that all of the pieces(chess & checkers) need to come out when playing as there is no retaining strap for the pieces.  This is extremely minor and not really a problem for me, but i figured I'd mention it.

Wooden Chess Set
","

  This A&A Wooden Chess Set is attractive and well made. It is ideal for giving you a complete chess experience. There is ample room to store the chess pieces when not in use and the board opens into a nice-size playing surface. The set is just the right size for carrying with you or storing in a convenient place. When the board is fully opened, the two parts fit snugly together. Chess players will love the lockable feature of the box.

Stained couch
","

  This is a fine chess set. Gets the job done. I do wish the pieces had a bit more weight to them, though. My main complaint is that the bottom has a finish that gets all over whatever the board is resting on. We put it on our new couch and we’re so upset when we finished our game and saw that there were black marks where the set was sitting. Just be sure to play on a surface that won’t stain!

Very nice chess set - for the price
","

  This set met my expectations, with a couple of exceptions below that I consider minor for this price range.  I'll try to post pictures later, but since I bought this as an early gift for my daughter it is currently hidden.  I especially like this size!  The pieces are light, but I don't mind that for play and for travel of course that's a plus.  Also, since we intend to play a fair amount, I was not too worried about detailed craftsmanship or aesthetic value of the set.  If you want perfection, you can easily pay over $100 for similarly sized house of Staunton pieces, so this set, for this price, is a good deal.  The squares are 1.5"".  Now for the exceptions, so perhaps the seller can take note:  one of the white pawns has an irregular head, which isn't a huge eyesore but is noticeable up close and I would have expected that any quality inspection person paying attention should have replaced that one.  No idea how automated manufacturing has become, but even then this looks almost like a lathe error and should have been rejected.  Second, the finish has a couple of noticeable flaws:  the brown finish on the king stands apart from the rest of the pieces, which, in itself doesn't matter in terms of color but the fact that it is a little off compared to other pieces is just noticeable.  Almost like it is spread too thin or something.  Last, the edges of the board:  I like the softer edges for both carry feel and general rounded look, but there should be more attention paid to the finishing touches during sanding to make this edge smoother.  This would eliminate the difference in look and feel while preserving the finish, which soaked in deeper due to roughness and left it looking dry.  Again, these are minor things but when the rest of the board looks amazing it stood out to me.  The inlaid wood squares look fanastic, and everything is tightly flush.  Overall, it is a nice-looking set and I expect to enjoy playing on it.

Good Quality and Made to Travel
","

  SolId quality , especially for a travel friendly chess set.  This also includes checkers. Loved that all pieces are stored in velvet bags inside so not just a jumbled mess when opened. Case latches securely so it doesn't fall open when on the go. Was very satisfied with this set. Quality was very good,  not super fancy though, so if you're looking for a set to display in your home, I'd go with a more intricate model. Very well made for travel, or for a kid's set, however.

This product meets and exceeds expectations.  No mo agonizing on iphen chess app..
","

  The chess pieces are nice and thick, with thick bases.  They are light but stable, which makes the board more portable.  The board looks very cleanly made and the joinery is nicer than standard diagonal butts.  It even comes with a tote case to protect the board surface when you stick it in your backpack to take to wherever you intend to go.  A note to the manufacturer: let the finish dry an extra day (although it is probably summertime where this is made and the humidity it higher now than in wintertime) or run an extra fan on it so that the checkers pieces are not as tacky and don't stick.  They popped apart easily using a butter knife, so no harm really.  Humidity seems to be the cause of this effect and an extra fan is the solution.  Overall, I like the way the pieces look, the board looks, the interior arrangement of the pieces, the tote bag, and the speed of shipment and delivery.  Way to go Licok Warehouse.  Now I can play chess without the agony of a tiny iphen screen board that causes me to accidentally misplay pieces every so often.

  All the pieces must be removed if you want to use the board for a game. So if we want to play checkers we still have to remove the chess pieces so the board will be flat. Also- our rook arrived damaged and had splinters- not safe for kids.

Yes, more women, but also racist caricatures
","

  I ordered this game for my ESL students to help them practice speaking. I remember the original version having next to no women, so I was glad to see an updated version of the game. Yes, this new version actually has equal numbers of men and women, but the fact of the matter is that the African-American faces are so grotesquely caricatured that I feel as though I have traveled back in time. It is unbelievable that a game I purchased in 2018 has a drawing of a minstrel show character as one of the people. Either I am going to draw new faces for all the characters myself, find new face cards, or throw the whole game out entirely. I cannot in good conscience recommend this game for anyone, and I strongly suggest that the creators reconsider their whole framework for what is acceptable. Unbelievable.

They say you can't go back, but evidently neither can manufacturing quality...
","

  I know this falls under the ""Surprise to No One"" category, but the build quality of this game is Far Far Below what it was 15 years ago. The game pieces often get jammed when you try and flip them down.  The game pieces often fall off when you try and push them down.  The game pieces often don't want to move when you try and push them down.It doesn't seem like this would have been a hard thing to reproduce, to give that satisfying clack when you flick the back of a tile, but oddly the game isn't very much fun to play when you can't emphatically knock down the Whos that you have eliminated.I used to play this game with my cousin for hours when I was much younger, and this was most certainly a disappointing walk down memory lane.

Flip-down faces are on thinner card stock than ""before"" and fall out easily.  Probably done to save 5 cents per unit.

  The flip-down parts used to have a thicker card stock.  Now it's basically paper, so they fall out easily.  Still the same game, still fun to play, but I'm betting the design choice to use cheaper paper was to save 5 cents per unit.  Thanks, Hasbro, you've ruined another relic from my childhood.

  I was really hoping to get a lot of use out of this game but it's in a million pieces. The cards fall out and the plastic flipping pieces are constantly breaking off.

Works...but could be better!

  I had a lot of fun using this to make my daughter a Disney Princess theme Guess Who! We actually did a couple themes to switch out! I love how it looks but there a few things I didn't love about this version.1. The pieces are very cheaply made and are hard to get up. The one we have from my childhood is built much better. Additionally, all the people come up when you flip it over.  With this one you have to manually flip most of them and the flaps constantly catch awkwardly and have to be fixed.2. The slots are a lot shorter and fatter in this version so printing off special versions took some tweaking. It is also harder to see some features like eye color. It was easier to see in the original size (for older version I printed off).It is still loads of fun and worked for us. I just wish it was more like the older one. My kids still think it's the coolest though!

  I guess I should have been prepared to get what I pay for. The construction and execution of these plastic game boards has dimisinished since my childhood set of guess who. The cheap plastic molds aren’t fitted well together, and it’s constantly getting stuck. It’s like the flippers get off track and don’t want to go down, or pop back up.

  Have so many fond memories of the travel version of this from when my brother and I used to play during long road trips, flights, etc. growing up! So, decided it was a perfect complement to add onto a variety of other games/activities my wife and I gathered up ahead of our nieces (ages 4 & 7) coming over for the weekend.The game has been updated a bit in the last 25 years in that it no longer is so narrow in how faces/people are conveyed. There is far greater diversity; eyes, hair (color/style), and other aspects of profile are no longer limited to ""conventional"" norms.Obviously, at its core, this game is a great play of guess-and-check, but as an adult, my appreciation is rooted more in the way it specifically opens up the way my nieces approach problem-solving and working through logic considerations to make each turn count!  You could clearly see the learning taking place from one round to the next as both girls started to think a bit more about the field at large rather than focusing on single traits at random.  This was far more evident in the 7 versus 4 year old as we partnered up with each to help, but both responded quickly relative to their respective ages and had a blast doing it!

  I like how the game transformed from being racist and sexist to more diverse- more people of color and equal amount of women (considering that Jess is a female) - this is an achievement, even though I don’t understand overly-cartoonish characters,but Hasbro also re-modeled the board. The retailers keep advertising a classic 3-row board, which actually has been discontinued and Hasbro switched to a 4-rows version, also SMALLER, which I find more difficult for a child. Classic version had 3 rows. Why did Hasbro need to fix something that wasn’t broken? The seller also needs to update the pictures, because what is pictures is not what you’re getting.Can Hasbro just keep the quality and artwork but just add diversion? That’d be great.

  I work in the schools and bought this game to replace an older version that was falling apart.  I could not believe what I saw when I opened it.  The images of the black and brown people were horrifying.  There were a couple that looked ""normal"" however, some of them were terrible caricatures.  Facial features were grossly exaggerated.  I WILL NOT use this game with kids. I called Hasbro and informed them of my concerns.  They offered to send out another product of equal value.  I feel like anyone who is appalled by this game needs to call the company.  It should be changed.

  I was VERY disappointed with this particular model of the Guess Who? game because the cartoon-like faces are not the same as the more realistic faces in my friends’ games. I would not have purchased this game if I had known this model was different. The cartoon-like faces in this particular model have 5 different shades of skin tone. It is difficult to distinguish one face from another. Also, one of the faces looks like a “black face”.  This particular model is racist!!

Terrible-Do not buy this game, find the old version.
","

  I used to love to play this game when I was a kid, so I ordered it to play with my own kids. I just received it today, and I already dislike it and am very disappointed. The first issue is the face cards and the fact that I had to put them in the holders. Then to top it off, they constantly slide out! It’s really annoying and I just don’t get why they made it like that, the original version didn’t have this issue at all. My other complaint, like others have mentioned, is the way they have portrayed the minorities. I’m glad they added more women and diversity, but they went about it all wrong. The black characters are very unrealistic and to be frank, pretty offensive the way they are portrayed. I’m really disappointed in the remake, if I knew about either of these issues prior, I wouldn’t have supported the company by buying this product. I’d actually rather have the old version. Very disappointed and frustrated. They’ve taken a great game and childhood memory I wanted to share with my kids, and essentially ruined it. My son is excited to play it, he loves board games, but it really just gets me more and more frustrated and angry the more we play with it. Hands down worst purchase from Amazon.

  The game itself is a good game, but the craftsmanship is quite poor. The plastic tabs get stuck up or down and are difficult for young kids (for whom the game is designed) to operate easily; the depictions are small and somewhat dark making the facial details difficult to see. The original game was much nicer in quality and with the clues that could be used. It is nice for the game to include different skin tones, but it limits asking for other clues. This basically comes down to skin tone, gender, hair color, hat. I'd recommend a wider selection of face cards and let families choose which ones to use in the game with their family. As kids advance, easier face cards could be swapped out for those that would require more scrutiny (if the drawings were a tad larger and easier to detect the details.)

  We bought this because we wanted the style of art from the classic version. (We have the new version as well, that has the big cards with vehicles, food, and sea life, but don't like the style of illustration. They are hard to tell what things are, especially the vehicles. And the smiley faces on inanimate objects is unnecessary. Also, we wanted to have people, which are not included in the game we already have.) We are disappointed because: 1. The cards fall out constantly. Every.single.time the door goes down, the card falls out. Impossible for kids to manage and ridiculously frustrating. We fixed it by hot gluing each individual card into its slot. While this took about 30 minutes, it made the game actually playable. 2. The illustrations aren't really the classic version. They are okay. . . better than the silly vehicles in the new version, but still can be hard to make out. It is just weird how they chose to design it. Shadows and shading just make things hard to see. Overall, after we glued in the cards, it is fun to play. But, the new design with the big cards is much smarter. But, the illustrations on these latest games leave a lot to be desired.

The game you know and love, but not the quality you remember

  A good thinking game for kids.  They do need to know some letters at least even if not able to read so they are able to make guesses and confirm other people's guesses by at least spelling out the names on the cards.  Main downside here is the materials are noticeably cheaper and thinner/flimsier than I personally remember.  I generally think most product are trending in this direction but it's worth noting. You'll have to take a little bit more care to not be rough with these. The plastic is thin, the faces are little thin cardboard you insert.  It's a little disappointing but doesn't affect gameplay and I'm okay with it given the very reasonable price.  I'd rather have two flimsy board games for $20 than one sturdy one for $10 honestly.  The $10 price boosts it to 5 stars despite the craftsmanship.

  Classic Guess Who game! The only reason why I took a star away is the quality. Craftsmanship of these newer games has gone downhill. We own many classic games that have been “updated” and all of them fall short in terms of quality.For this game, the board games are all around flimsy. At least half of the yellow card holders are difficult to position upright when you want them upright and sometimes they don’t flip down as easily as you’d like. Often times they come out of socket when propping back up and have to be popped back in.I would still recommend this game, as well as other classic games (Connect 4, Battleship, etc) that have been updated, but know the quality is not like you remember!

  The concept of this games is okay in that it encourages kids to use their voices. This is particularly relevant for the kids who have difficulties speaking.

Asking if the person is male or female really narrows the choices. Then hair color, wearing a hat or eye color, are really the only questions to ask. I remember this feeling difficult as a child.

  Some of the plastic pieces get jammed so that they all don't flip over smoothly. They sometimes get caught at angles with the hinges popping off slightly on one side. The paper pieces with the faces on them are a thin cardstock material that can easily be bent upon assembly. Once we got them in place though, we haven't had any fall out. Also, My children had differing opinions on whether certain face(s) were he/she (it is also unclear to me) so it makes it a bit more difficult to play with out of the box. Overall it is still fun to play with once we got used to the things mentioned above. I got this on sale during Christmas time, so I gave it 4 stars. If it had been regular price I would have given it 3 stars due to value for price.

  This is worse then the guess who I played when I was a little girl. I can see why it’s so cheap. Bought as a gift for my daughter for Christmas because we like to play games together. The hinges for the people suck. They basically pop apart any time you have to move them. My 8 year old is even annoyed with it.Would not recommend. Would not buy again. Would not gift.

Crap

  Cheap crap! Not worth the money. I only paid $5 for this but it’s not even worth that. The paper cards don’t stay in the plastic frames and the frames don’t flip up and down without getting stuck or popping out. The game is over in 5 guesses or less. We just ended up playing a tiny card game. One of the older versions is so much better.

Still luck-based, but with some creative ideas that your kids might love
","

  I bought this after watching several positive YouTube reviews for the game.  Our daughter turned five on Christmas Eve and I've been wanting some games that will challenge her mentally instead of giving her a win simply with dice or a spinner.  (Seriously, spinner games are the worst!)This game...  it kinda tackles that...  Kinda.There are still dice, and there's a simple rule that states you have to declare your goal for the dice before you roll - you can't just go with what the dice gives you.  This is the luck element, and it is the only thing that will dictate success or failure at the game.  Success simply requires enough successful rolls to uncover and reveal the three clues which relate to your randomly-chosen ""thief"" at the beginning of the game, as well as revealing enough of the suspects until you find the one containing all three clues.  You could get lucky and reveal the clues quickly, matching to a suspect revealed early in the game.  Or you can have some nail-biters where the clues are revealed but the matching suspect is literally the last one left to flip over.  Or you can botch enough rolls and lose.  It helps that the game is cooperative, meaning that you don't feel as personally victimized by the luck.  However, get a few older people around the table, and you might get someone blaming someone else for not getting enough successful rolls.The skill is simply understanding how to determine which of the suspects is innocent or guilty based on the clues revealed and the results from the clue-finding device (which itself is fun to work with.)  To an adult this is a no-brainer, but to a five-year-old it's a bit more complex.  The plus side - and the reason I ultimately like the game - is the sheer thrill a child experiences when they connect the dots and nail the thief.A few other notes: the game takes up a decent amount of real estate.  The board is rather large, and you're required to lay 16 cards either around the board or otherwise nearby.  This is in no way a complaint, but just a head's up - as far as kids games go, this one is rather large.Also, the cards feel a tad thin, and my daughter already bent one just sliding it into the clue-finder piece.  The theme and gameplay might work for a young kid, but the cards won't stand up to a lot of abuse.  In addition, the game arrived with the cards rubber-banded instead of the usual plastic wrap, meaning many of our cards were ""marked"" on arrival.  The detective hats and fox pieces are a soft plastic that allow a little bending (which is good), and the dice are nicely printed with vibrant colors.All in all the game is a good, if not short-term addition to the collection; kids will find it much more replayable than adults (kids can even play solo if they wanted to), with a fun theme that lightly encourages teamwork, albeit with an inescapable element of luck.

Fun Game to introduce Big Kid board games
","

  Bought this for my 4.5 year old as an introductory deductive logic game. At first, I was pretty disappointed by the simplicity of the logic needed for the game. Basically, you find out if the guilty fox does or does not have a particular item on their person. If the guilty party does have the item, then you eliminate all the suspects that do not have that item and if the guilty party does not have the item, then you eliminate all the suspects that do have the item. Simplistic enough that my 4.5 year old caught on pretty quick and was able to keep or eliminate suspects without assistance. So why the 5 star rating if the game was not what I hoped it would be? It is because my daughter LOVES this game and she has never liked board games all that much. Also the game does teach a fair amount of 4.5-7 year old appropriate strategy and has just a little bit of complexity to it which she has never had the patience to learn for any other game we have tried. I see it as a great way to introduce 4-7 year old kids to big kid board games, that a 4-7 year old will probably love.

  A great deduction game to play with kids that teaches basic logic and tests memory.  Three year old child just grasps the decisions and makes some errors in logic.  Five year old clearly makes good decisions based on logic and memory.  Seven year old finds it easy and will quickly out grow it.  The play length is ideal for playing a quick game with Dad before dinner.  Recommended but only for playing with kids aged 3-7.

FANTASTICALLY DESIGNED GAME FOR SMALL CHILDREN
","

  The folks at Department of Recreation designed this game and did an awesome job! We just got it a few days ago and my just-turned-5 year old can't stop talking about it. She loves it! As her mom, I'm enjoying it too. It's nice to have a game that's at least mildly interesting for grown-ups who play along with their children (as opposed to things like Candy Land).This game is sort of like ""Clue"" for little kids. A fox stole a potpie and you have to figure out which fox it was before s/he escapes into the foxhole. There are SUSPECT cards, each with the picture and name of a fox. Then there are THIEF cards - one for each of the suspects. One of the THIEF cards is chosen (but kept secret) in the beginning of the game. You then spend your turns either revealing SUSPECTS or finding CLUES. The clues are things like hat, scarf, glasses, umbrella, etc and whether or not the THIEF has those items. For example, you might find out that your guilty fox is wearing a hat and pearls but does not have an umbrella or glasses. Once you've revealed the SUSPECT card that matches all your clues, you know who the guilty fox is and can announce it. But if you aren't able to figure out the clues fast enough, the fox gets away. There is dice-rolling involved (but no numbers on the die, just symbols) for an element of luck/chance.One of the coolest features of the game is the ""magic clue revealer"" thingy. It's a plastic case that you slide the chosen THIEF card into at the beginning of the game. Then, every time you get a CLUE, you place the clue (i.e. a token with a picture of a hat on it) onto a spot on the revealer. Then you slide open a door and you will see either a red or green dot, indicating whether your THIEF does or does not have that item (i.e. the hat) on him. This part is a lot of fun for the little ones!I'd say this game is great for the ages of about 4-8. It teaches great critical thinking skills,like logic and deduction.

What a lovely, clever game for a family with young kids!
","

  Today this arrived and we played it already and loved it! Board games are one of the best ways I have found to bond with my two young sons. So, I went on a shopping spree for them on Amazon and this game was one of the suggestions made by Amazon. They based it on several other games I had purchased by this same game company - games we also have enjoyed.First thing is the packaging and contents:  the box, the board, the tokens - everything is just so nice! Really fine quality. This company really puts in effort. I feel loke I got what I paid for.The game itself is so clever!!!! I am 37 years old but i found myself hooting and hollering in relief and joy when after my third and last try with the dice rolled in our favor! We narrowly won our first game. The fox was just a couple bad rolls away from escaping.This game is definitely worth it for little ones. It is the perfect middle ground of difficulty level for both my 7 year old and 4.5 year old.It has that collaborative factor that brings us together. Although the game works by turn taking all involved are still working as a team. We made decisions as a team if the person with the next turn should choose to reveal suspects or clues.There are 16 suspect cards and the decoder cards are a sequence of dots- hard to explain without showing it but let me say you will not memorize those 16 decoder cards no matter how many times you play the game. So, it will never get old. Very clever developers.

Who dun it???

  This is a really great game! I played it today with my 5 year old and my husband and we all really enjoyed it. It has a really unique premise - a child-sized mystery. On each turn you must decide whether you’re going to attempt to reveal a clue or reveal 2 suspects. You work together throughout the game to try to catch the thief by using the clues to eliminate suspects. If you don’t roll either 3 clue icons or 3 suspect icons on your turn - the Fox gets to move 3 spaces closer to making an escape. It’s very well done and super cute. There is an element of chance, and a lot of problem solving & logic. Can’t wait to play again!

Highly recommended game for 4+ year olds. A great gift!

  Great game for 4+ year olds - and is actually fun for the adults playing as well!This game takes concepts we've seen in other classic games – Yahtzee (the re-rolling of dice), Guess Who (the elimination of ""suspects"" based on ""clues"") and Clue (moving around a ""map"" to find clues) – but combines them in a way that feels fresh and fun. Plus, the added collaborative aspect is well implemented, too.I also like that they err on the side of the game being too easy than too punishing - e.g., you'll usually be able to make it to the next ""clue site"" with one turn; had they spaced them out even slightly more, it would have made the game drag, especially for a little one.As it stands, it's well-paced fun, with just the right balance of ""thinking"" and luck.Highly recommended!

  Some games that are geared for my kids make me want to stick a fork in my eye (I'm looking at you, Chutes and Ladders), but this is pretty fun. In this cooperative game, all the players are trying to figure out the identity of the fox thief by revealing clues and checking out suspects. The process of the game encourages logic, deduction, and analytics, but don't tell my kids that. Game play didn't take too long (maybe 20 minutes?) and was enjoyed by the whole family, from the 4 year old to the 60 year old grandpa. (Younger than 4 would probably lose interest)

Better than many other kid games

  I have played this game with my kids many times and still enjoy it when we get to play. As a father that has many board games and wants to pass that love on to my kids - I get tired of playing games like Hi-Ho Cherrio or Clue Jr over and over as the games just feel stale and repetitive. This game allows children to play the same game over and over but solve the problem from different angles and learn great board game skills along the way. This game has the randomness of dice throws, decision making, a ""countdown"" timer to a win or lose condition, pawn movement, problem solving, and a memory element. I encourage every parent with younger kids to try this one out. I play this with my 4 year old and 6 year old regularlyand while the game is fun the best thing about it is that my 4 year old stays for the whole game because it holds his interest. Hope your family enjoys it as much as we do.

  I had heard great things about this game, and was excited when it came. My son and I played a round and loved it, except when we got to the end, and there was only one suspect left, it didn't match the THIEF card. So I went through and looked - out of the 16 suspect cards and 16 thieve cards (which obviously need to match up), only ONE matched. The names were different on the cards!!  OK, nothing customer service can't fix - just send me a matching set of cards. So I reached out and got this response: ""Please allow around 10-14 days from the date of this email for delivery - a bit longer for international destinations.""  that email was written on 1/20/20 and it's now 2/13/20 and NOTHING.

Infuriating design and quality control
","

  This game may have good gameplay and replay-ability once you figure it out, but I’m really disappointed with everything else about the design of the game, particularly at getting you quickly to the point of actually playing.First of all, the instructions are lengthy and dumbed down to the point of handholding, so you have to walk through the entire set of instructions every time you reference them to find the simplest information. This probably doesn’t matter once you’ve played a few times, but there are a lot of mechanics to this game that are not self evident, so you end up having a VERY slow setup and first few plays.It says 5 and up, but even the most gifted 5yos I have met are going to have a hard time deciphering these instructions and getting things setup without the help of a child with 5th grade+ reading comprehension. And the dumbed down nature and lack of organization to the instructions will frustrate older kids and test the patience of adults.Second, the uninspired game board and graphics add insult to the injury of poor instructions. The game board has NO LABELS and low contrast - so nothing stands out, and painfully, the instruction indicating what all the unlabeled spaces mean is not separate from the sequential setup/gameplay instructions, just annoyingly mixed along the way with setup AND gameplay instructions.The concept and quality of all the disparate mechanical parts is low. There is a clue tool that is poorly designed, manufactured, and nearly unintelligible in its function without those horrible instructions. There are so many better ways to add this functionality to the game with fewer dissimilar pieces.The worst is that the first few times through, clues didn’t work and the game completion actually FAILED due to incomplete hole punches that obscured the clues. This kind of quality control just further complicated an awkward design and really detracted from gameplay.We tried to play three games and were so annoyed and unimpressed that we lost interest and will just give it away to another family now.Other irritating things about this game...The box is twice as thick as necessary to contain the contents and this brand includes a thick foldout advertisement for all their other games in every box that doesn’t really fit anywhere but the garbage can and is basically just photos.

Defective decoder
","

  If the decoder worked as it is supposed to, this would 100% be a new favorite game in our house. The actual game play is great, my 4 year old and 14 year old were having a great time playing, which is rare finding a game both ages like. Our box had a defective decoder (I’ve seen others mention it now too when researching). It wasn’t obvious to us, until we finished the game and couldn’t figure out why our last suspect wasn’t correct. When we put the suspect card into the decoder facing the right way and push the card all the way in, apparently the card is actually going down far enough (but for some unexplainable reason, if we put it in backwards, the car goes in lower and would be in the right position...I can’t for the life of me figure out why because the card is the same thickness so direction shouldn’t matter as far as how far down it will go, but we can’t play with the card backwards.) My engineer husband said he will get a small saw blade later and see if he can fix the decoder so this game will still work, but unfortunately, since we didn’t realize it wasn’t working correctly until after we played the first time, my kids have now soured on this game and aren’t interested in playing again (hopefully someday they will).

The game is defective. Very disappointing.
","

  This game is a fantastic concept. I love that it's cooperative instead of competitive, so my younger kids have an opportunity to be a part of the win. I wanted to give it 5 stars, but our game is defective, so I just can't at this time. If the company replaces the defective item or sends a replacement, I will update. The clues and clue decoder work together to tell you what garments the thief is wearing. Every thief card has 3 green dots that are revealed one by one with the clues that are inserted into the decoder to let you know that the thief has on glasses, a scarf, an umbrella, etc... Well not a single one of our thief cards line up with the viewfinder in the clue decoder, so only 1 of 3 green dots are possible to be viewed after collecting all of the clues. This results in every single suspect being eliminated...and it being impossible to win the game. I don't know if it's the decoder or the deck of thief cards that are defective, but it was very disappointing for my 5 year old who was gifted this...especially since we didn't realize the defect until the suspects were all eliminated and the game couldn't be won.

so much fun and educational
","

  This game is so great! We call this the “Sly Fox Game”. Perfect for a 5 year old and adults (I think I love it as much as the 5 yr old does). The complexity of thought involved is extraordinary compared to some other games—strategy, memory, counting, deductive reasoning, chance (the dice; choice of thief), cooperation, reading (names), etc. Each play involves several decisions or calculations : try for clues or suspects; if clues, how many spots and what direction?; is the spot white/green and therefore does the thief have x ?; if yes/no, are any of the visible suspects ruled out or still in? Do we have enough info? Should we guess? The game is engaging and fun. It may be that one day we know the thieves well enough that we can guess early on, but there are enough thieves to keep a 5 yr old (and even an adult who isn’t trying to memorize the suspect cards) from easily identifying all the thieves by their details. The thief cards are very attractive with rich colors and fun images. The 4 squares per clue box makes the clue spots accessible and yet the distance between some provides some challenge. The option to have the fox move more or fewer spots at a time in a given game is a simple (practical and elegant) way to make the game easier or more challenging for kids. Added fun, detective hats can be replaced with any other small toy (miniature paw patrol dogs work great ; lego superheroes do too). Can’t say enough good things about the game.

  This game was perfect for us and our almost 5 year old.  We played twice as soon as it arrived and had a ton of fun.  The first time through we pretty much identified the thief immediately, so I was afraid it might be too easy, but the second time through we ended up down to two possible suspects and had to scramble to find relevant clues before the thief escaped.  I love that the box has a spot for everything, so it stays organized without adding ziplock baggies to the mix.  I will recommend this game to others with young kids.Oh, the directions did not mention whether you can go to the same clue space more than once, but we determined it made way more sense not to be able to, and that’s how we played.  Once a clue was placed on that square, we did not revisit that square.

Excellent cooperative game for a six year old
","

  We were desperately looking for games to play as a family while we have been staying at home during the pandemic. Emotions are running a bit high and competitive games are sometimes ending in tears. Unfortunately, a lot of cooperative games are not challenging enough to entertain kids older than pre-school age. This game turned out to be a big win for us. There is definitely some luck but it requires some basic deductive reasoning to beat the fox.In this game, all players are competing against the fox to figure out 'who done it.' There are 16 different possible fox thieves and each has a matching suspect card. You pick one thief card without looking and put the card in a special plastic holder. (Other thief cards are not used during the game and are returned to the box.) Suspect cards are placed face down around the board, four per side. On the board, each player gets a game piece and there is a fox. There are also 'clues' that are either stacked or placed face down nearby. Each 'clue' is a small card that fits into the special plastic holder.Players then take turns rolling three special dice that have eyes and paw prints on the six sides. You must declare prior to rolling if you want to ""reveal suspects"" or ""search for clues."" Then you have three rolls to match the dice with your declaration--eyes to reveal suspects or paws to search for clues. You get to hold the 'correct' dice on a roll and only re-roll the 'wrong' dice. If you get all three dice to match what you declared by the third roll, you get to take that action.Revealing suspects: The player gets to turn over two suspect cards. Each suspect is dressed a certain way and may or may not be wearing things such as a scarf, pearls, white gloves, umbrella, flower, etc.Searching for clues: The player moves their game piece on the board the number of paw prints shown on the dice (ranges from 3-6). The goal for moving your game piece is to make it to open spots on the board that allow you to search for clues. You can typically reach a spot in one or two turns. Once on a spot, the player takes a 'clue', which is an item that the thief may or may not be wearing (scarf, pearls, white gloves, etc.) and places that card into the special holder. A window slides open to reveal if the thief is or isn't wearing that item. Using deductive reasoning, the team can then look at the suspect cards that are revealed to determine whether or not the suspects are innocent. Innocent suspect cards are returned to the box.Didn't match all three dice in three rolls? The fox moves forward 3 spaces toward its fox hole.Play continues like that, eliminating innocent suspects by revealing suspects or clues. The goal is to get down to one final suspect--who is the guilty fox--before the fox gets away by reaching his fox hole.There are some variations explained in the instructions, but those are the basics.I would highly recommend this game for kids over age 6. Kids under 5 would need help with the reasoning part, but could participate. It might be a bit too simplistic for kids over around age 8.

Perfect for a 5 year old who hates to lose
","

  As a huge fan of board games myself, it's been a long time dream to introduce my son to board games.  So far, games like candy land and memory have not gone well... he's ultra competitive and hates losing or even having a bad turn.  We try to take it back to basics, and focus on the fun, and learning how to take turns... yea, none of that has worked for him yet.  But then I realize some of my favorite board games are cooperative and I started researching... that's when I found this game.  It took me weeks to just order it, thinking this might just be a waste of money, but I'm so glad I did now!This game has been a breath of fresh air for us.  Yesterday three of us sat down to play this for the first time and it was a complete success from start to finish.  He loved it.  We won the two games we played, and only the first time did it start looking a little iffy.  The second time it wasn't even close.  It would take a lot of unlucky rolls to lose this game.  But I don't think it matters.  If anything he's learning through this game that we can have fun together.  He waited patiently for his turn and was happy because things are happening on every turn.Adults may get bored by this game eventually.  The strategy is simple and there aren't a lot of difficult decisions to make.  But it's mostly fun watching your little figure out how to use the secret clue decoder and eliminate suspects.  I'm not sure how many times we'll play this one, but I like that it's something that's fun for now and probably when friends come over too.

I enjoy the game also which is great because there are some children’s games that they love and I have to force myself to play. Ha!The only “flaw,” and this won’t be an issue for everyone, is that after my children played several times they had memorized the cards so they didn’t need to uncover any suspects to guess the thief. This could use an expansion deck so there are more fox options and then the game wouldn’t be quite as easy to beat.

  We got this game for our 3 and 5 year old kids for Christmas.  We have played it about 5 times in the past two days.Pros:  Super cute, creative way to try and discover which fox stole the pie.  It is great for young kids to look at the foxes and make predictions and inferences.  It has also been fun for me as an adult to play, which says a lot since lots of kids games can easily get boring.  There are several cute fox cards and the goal is to use the clues to find out if it was the fox wearing the hat, gloves, necklace, etc.Cons:  It comes with a large game board, but I don't see the need to visit all the spots on the game board.  You could almost get away with staying in one corner of the board and going back and forth to look for clues.  I wish the game board had better features so that you wanted to visit more of the board.Overall, a great game and I am happy we got it.

A really fun game for small kids and their parents
","

  This particular game was bought for my six-year old and it is a very enjoyable game for both child and parents.  The game is sort of like Clue but very oriented towards the younger kids.  The game teaches kids about luck and consequences (trying to roll a particular result, otherwise the fox gets closer to his escape), rudimentary map reading skills (how to move the pieces on the board as it is very two-dimensional), logic (not only in the positive, but also in the negative with clues -- culprit may wear a top hat but does not wear a scarf), application (putting clues together with suspects to narrow down to the culprit), and team work (the game is a team endeavor to capture the guilty member and not trying to hide clues for one individual to win; everyone wins or everyone loses).Though this game is fun to play, the game is still oriented for small kids.  Once the child matures to the level of figuring out the game logic by ways of doing it with a few clues, it will lose some of its luster.  Again, it is a great game for small kids and their parents wanting to spend time with them.

Great game. Kudos for the perfect storage box.

  I've got dozens of kids games and this one may be the best.-Co-op gameplay is great for kids. Different skill levels can all play together happily.-Simple to play yet with enough choices to keep things interesting - choose to look for clues or reveal suspects.-Deductive reasoning component makes kids think but is still simple enough for a 4-year-old to grasp.-Illustrations are attractive and fun.-Perfect storage box which is an often overlooked but extremely valuable part of a board game. This one has plastic molding that creates compartments for every different card or piece in the game. Everything looks nice and neat when put away. Makes clean up fun and makes set up and play easy.-I've played this game dozens of times and I estimate we win 90% of the time which I think is good for kids.This game is perfect - just get it. I also highly recommend

Returned. Second Game Still Defected But Playable. Fun Game Though
","

  Decoder was busted. Card wouldn’t slide in far enough to reveal clues. Returned product. Got another quickly. Decoder is also made incorrectly on the new game. This time you can sort of push the card in while holding it tightly and shove it past the plastic “lip” defect in the decoder to make it work. As other reviews have mentioned there is a flaw in many copies of this game which is very unfortunate. I would still say this is an amazing game. Very fun and great cooperative critical thinking. My kids enjoy it. It’s just very unfortunate that quality control is an issue for this particular game. If you are buying it for yourselves I still say it’s a good game and worth the risk that the decoder is messed up. If it’s a gift do not risk it

You can’t actually lose the game
","

  The fox escaping which causes you to lose the game has to go to far, even with the ‘difficult’ setting. You can uncover all three clues, and flip all the suspects, and the fox still won’t get within 10 squares (two moves) of the end.  My son still likes it (5.5 years) but there should still be some chance of losing. The other cooperative game we got him, Mole Rats in Space has genuine risk of loss and decisions to make. We still win about 3/4 of the time, but the losing does matter.

  Both my 4 year daughter and my 7 year old son love this game.  And I love playing it with them.  It’s a great cooperative game and I love seeing them get excited for each other and me when we roll what we need.  The gameplay is simple and involves memory (you have to remember which clues are on the suspect and which are not) as well as deductive reasoning (determining which suspects should be removed based on the clues).  We did not win the first time we played as there was a little confusion over the paw prints on the dice but have won many times since then.  The kids have even been known to pull it out and play by themselves.  Highly recommend this game!

  We love this game. I happened to stumble across this game at a discount store for next to nothing. The box was damaged, looked up the price on Amazon read the reviews and thought ""what a steal"" I'll take it for $2.It's very easy to learn. I like that it's a cooperative game. We have several of those types of games. This one is more challenging then those. 8yr okd and 5yr old can play on their own.This game is so well loved that we have purchased it several times from Amazon to pass the love of the game on to others.It has also led us to discovered other games that Gamewright has made and we have really enjoyed everything we have played from them.

  This was one of a stack of games that arrived two days after Amazon's giant sale on board games. I have been on a hunt for games my 5 year old can play that aren't awful (candyland and snakes and ladders are not going to happen.) This was a CLEAR winner. He can do every aspect of this without any adult help. Bonus points, the 9 year old ALSO loves it, AND it's fairly quick.Some of our family's infatuation with this game COULD come from our incurable silliness. We accuse suspects, we lament the fox's progress toward victory. My 5 year old plays the bad cop side of good cop/bad cop toward whoever the lead suspect is. When the previous round's culprit is cleared of wrongdoing, we praise him for turning his life around. But the point is it's fun, and the kids beg me to play again and again. Highly recommend.

Mostly love it - but...
","

  I love the concept of this game - it's kind of a Clue / Guess Who? combination of sorts. It's fun to play - and has a few variations to make it more difficult which is nice.But...I don't love the part where you have to pick if you are going to roll for suspects or for clues - so we just skip and you pick after your first roll. No biggie really.In my opinion though, the game board could have been cleaner. There are too many spaces to move from place to place to get to clues. I think it's unnecessary.  It could have been either a much simpler board OR just no need for players to move spaces at all - just roll 3 dice to get 3 suspects or 3 clues. Wish the board had spaces for the fox to move -- and then spaces on the board for the clue cards - those not used yet - and then a space for the ""yes"" clues and a space for the ""no"" clues.

My kids love this game, and I love that's it's cooperative
","

  Got this game for my kids for Christmas and they have loved it.  It is really great that they work together and they love getting to roll the dice a bunch of times.  My only issue, and it might just be with the one I got, is that the contraption that holds the card to give hints as to who the thief is- isn't sized well. It's REALLY difficult to get a clue card into the slot so that the clues will show up correctly, my kids can't do it alone and have bent a bunch of cards out of shape attempting to.  I have tried to shave around the inside to see if that would fix it, but I still always have to put the cards in, and it's difficult even for me.

Great game, with modifications to make it more difficult

  We really enjoyed this game. We read reviews beforehand, and disagree with the complaints about quality - we felt the quality of the cards was just fine. Our 4.5 year old instantly loved this game. The decoder design is pretty neat, and easy enough for a 4 year old to operate. Our only complaint is that it is too easy to win if you play by the rules. To make it harder to win, we increased the fox's movement to 5, reduced the number of roles from 3 to 2, and made a rule that someone couldn't go to a clue spot that had already been visited. With those rules in place, the game became more challenging. I'd also recommend more suspects, more clues to have to remember, etc. All in all, we love this game and highly recommend it!

Defective thief or suspect card

  Update 1/20/20 - exchanged it hoping the new one will work. Unfortunately not. I give up. It seemed like a fun game but I can’t keep exchanging it.Defective - like the other reviews, either the thief card or the suspect cards are defective. We played it for the first time and eliminated all the suspects, then looked at the thief card - matched it to the decoder and realized there is a defect. I do wish to get the game replaced as we enjoyed playing it.

","

  My 5 year old niece and I played this game for the first time tonight. She loved it so much it kept her attention for 3 straight games. I really liked that the game is based on team work, and I'd say that she did too, since she was high-fiving me anytime either of us got to a clue or knocked out a suspect. The concept is great, but the clues were a bit confusing with the red and green options, we had to keep reminding each other which were the clues to find suspects and knock out others. This game works on both team work and deductive reasoning skills.

There is no challenge! :(
","

  Confused at all 5 star reviews here🤷‍♀️1) I needs to agree that cards are way too think for this age group. Considering there is a decoder - Card’s get bent and creased easily, so bunch of them get marked.2) There is literally no challenge. We played this game so many times and we have never been outfoxed. Never. What’s the challenge if you always know you’re going to win? It’s either the fox needs to go more spaces (a lot more), or instead of flipping 2 suspect cards- get 1 instead. And so that said, the game gets BORING.3) I wish game board manufacturers would ditch the idea of quad-folding boards. They are really annoying.4) Other than that, yeah.. it’s a “good game”... I wish I could return it and get something that’s more captivating and keeps you interested.

  We  wanted to get a board game that teaches team work for our 4 years old. We opened the box, the quality was amazing. The game is  a detective game and it was really fun. You have to work together to solve the case and find the thief(the fox) before he/she gets away. Personally I hate most of the board games when you have to put them away, you can only put all the pieces in the box and they all mixed up and very annoying. The best part of this game besides it is fun, and educational, the pieces has its place to go when you are ready to put them away. The game comes with a tray that every game pieces can be neatly put away! Buy it!

A fun game with no winners or losers
","

  So the beauty  of this game, if you have children who get upset when they lose, is that this game has no winners or losers. All the players work together (in a very uncomplicated way) to outfox the fox. It seems like a game that would appeal to the preschool age, but our 6 year old and 8 year old grandchildren really enjoyed the game, as well as our 4 year old. It's refreshing to see them all crossing their fingers in hopes that the other players (siblings) will be able to prevent the fox from winning the game.  The instructions are a bit weak, in fact, we had to resort to YouTube. Really? For a game designed for 5 year olds and up? But you can do some improvising and interpret the rules as you wish and still have fun.

Popular with my kids ages 4-6
","

  This is a wonderful, collaborative game that lets kids practice logical reasoning skills in a team-based way (all players are on a team vs. the fox/thief). A good way to play this with kids of different ages or ability levels is to have the older or more advanced kids verbally share their reasoning as they eliminate suspects based on clues, to help the younger kids follow along. Additionally, older kids enjoy pausing the game for a few minutes to look at the remaining suspects and predict which clues would be most helpful in finding the thief.

FUN and exciting game with some minor adjustments to the game play.
","

  We've made the game way more exciting by putting the clue chips on the board (not part of the instructions). This makes the game way more interesting as then there is purpose to moving the hats.  Otherwise, you move between two clue spots and just keep capturing clues.  My students love the inductive and deductive reasoning involved and rip the code checker out of anyone's hand to reveal the outcome.  It is like opening a present every time you get to check.  They love thinking through who might have done it and who can be ruled out.  It does not require capturing all the clues to solve the ""who done it.""  This is not explained in the game, but when looking at the cards closely (adults can take the lead on this), you can identify how many clues you need to find the thief.

  My 5 and 6 year old nieces are obsessed with this game and want to play it every single day. They caught on pretty quickly to the rules but haven't grown tired of it after nearly 2 months of daily play. Often they will want to play it 3 or 4 times in a row. The concept is cute and it's a group game so the competition factor is low. That's good for one of my nieces who gets very stressed out by pressure and the idea of failing. She seems to love the team effort. It's also got some great learning skills built into it, like memory, visual cues, and counting. Great game all around!

  Got this to play with my 6 year old and we both have a good time with it. She really like Clue Jr and Outfoxed combines a lot of those concepts, but the thing I like is that there is less set up and clean up to it. Can be a little less fun when your first suspect lines up with first two clues as you basically can nail your guy right from the start, but overall those games are far and few in between. Games take about 15min; replay ability seems decent enough but not something you will probably keep going back to on a constant basis.

  This is my favorite game to play with our kids (ages 5 and 9), and we love to play and own a lot of board games, so that says a lot! It can be difficult to find games that don't result in sibling rivalry, that don't repackage what an existing board game already does, and that are easy to understand for younger kids while still being fun for older kids (and adults). This game is fun to play, creatively developed, and well-made. I noticed the few criticisms that exist are mostly about missing parts or confusing instructions, but all of our pieces were there (and the game is such a good one that it's worth exchanging if you happen to be missing parts), and if the instructions are unclear, playing a single round should help them become clear. Over all, it's an excellent game and I can't recommend it more highly!

  It's a fun little game to play with a toddler.The concept is simple enough for my 3 year old to easily master. There is a spinner with about 6 or 7 possible outcomes, all shown with pictures.The object is to remove all the fruit from your tree first. The spinner tells you if you can take 1, 2, 3, or 4 fruits off, and has other options like lose a turn and having to put all your fruit back on the tree. Simple stuff.There is zero strategy. It's all luck of the spinner.It's not so nightmarishly simple so that it's painful for adults to play with kids. But it won't entral you like Monoply will either. (Also your kids will win this more than Monopoloy. So if you hate losing to you kids...well....)What games like this are great for is teaching small children how to follow rules. This is a very rule based game with no strategy. So it's all about following the rules. This is a great way to teach kids how to do this, which is a valuable lesson for obvious reasons.

Good game very similar to the original. Required assembly was a bit more than it should be. Game play still the same as always.
","

  Good game, very similar to what I remember from my childhood, with the primary difference being that there are now four different fruit (blue berries, cherries, green apples, and oranges) rather than just all cherries, which can be somewhat of a pain since now you have to sort out the fruit when setting up. Not a big deal though.The game came in quite the unassembled state, which while not a huge deal, I was a bit disappointed by the fact that even the game board required me to fold all four sides down and tape them (no tape was provided) to set the game board in its elevated state. I ended up actually using a hot glue gun rather than tape. I also used the hot glue gun to adhere the spinner base to the bottom of the spinner card, ensuring the spinner would operate more reliably.I would like to have seen the game come with at least the board properly built, and I would also have liked to see the game built such that the spinner mounts in the middle of the main game board, rather than being its own separate entity that must be passed around. If memory serves, that was how the original game I played in my youth was designed.Otherwise, the directions were clearly written, there was a new game play version focusing on cooperative play that employs the use of an included puzzle to provide the ""competition"", which may eventually be an enjoyable alternative version (we haven't played that version yet), and the graphics were decent and not overbearing like so many other of the modern remakes of classic kids' board games.The final say on the game: my 3 year old daughter loves it.

Classic game with poor features
","

  This is a fun game to help challenge the kids with their math skills.  The game is fun but it probably wont last long as there are several poor features that take away from the long time use of the game.  Maybe this version of the game will be updated one day but I probably could have constructed my own version of this game with my own construction or card stock paper.  There are several small pieces with this game so please be careful with allowing small toddlers to play with it.  It's a classic game but it definitely needs to have its features upgraded.

Teaches turn taking & following instructions
","

  This game was a disappointment. I bought it because my 4yo is about to age out of his occupational therapy, and he's not holding a pen / pencil yet. But the tediousness of setup with this game, the ease of disturbing pieces after set up, and the fact that the play is so rote that my 4 year old has lost interest before the game is over (not usual for him) make this a game I don't think we'll play much. Even the collaborative version of play seemed boring (and we NEVER landed on the bird, so we didn't even get to start to put the puzzle together). What a waste. I just did some more research and am watching videos of games being played this time before buying them. There ARE games that exist that can engage tiny hands / big hands alike, which I think would be more fun for him... I prefer he learns a game that doesn't ""talk down"" to him. In any case, if you have a kid who just likes to organize little pieces, this game is for you!

Fun for 2.5 years old and up!
","

  I bought this to play with my daughter and she loves it! She got it when she was 2 and 7 months and was able to learn how to play it pretty quickly (less than a week). Now she's almost 3 and she understands it completely! It teaches to take turns and practice counting. Although there isn't a strategy here (just spin and hope for the best) it's not too dull for me and I enjoy playing it with her.The only downside is there are small parts, so if you have younger babies at home keep an eye out and put this up high when done ao you don't have a chocking hazard.

A nice game but the quality could be better
","

  A simple but fun game. The rules are easy to learn and follow and my daughter enjoys it. Two downsides for me - they playing pieces or ‘cherries’ are really small so very easy to lose. The second - and biggest - negative though is the playing board is super flimsy. It’s a folded box of very thin card which bends and breaks very easily - especially when my young child is paying with it and doesn’t yet have a concept of her own strength. It’s a shame the board isn’t made of something stronger otherwise this would be a 4 or even 5 star review.

Where was this game when I was little?
","

  My daughter's 4, and the only board game she's really played much of is Candyland. I never played Hi Ho Cherry-O when I was little, but based on the things I've read, it seemed like a safe bet. I mean hey, she has orange hair and loves dogs, so she was already interested based on the box art alone. We played this for a good 30 minutes the other day and she really enjoyed it, though she still hates losing of course...Hi Ho Cherry-O is easy to play and set up. Up to 4 people can play, with each person having their own tree or bush to pick fruit from. You have cherries, blueberries, oranges and green apples, and 10 of each fruit are on each tree. Players take turns spinning an arrow that will land on either a number, a bird, a dog or a basket. If it lands on a number, they take that many of their fruit from the tree and put it in their basket. If it lands on the bird or dog, the animal 'eats' one piece of fruit and the player has to put it back on the tree. And if the arrow lands on the basket? They lose ALL their fruit and have to put every piece back on the tree! The first person to get 10 pieces of fruit wins.Like I said, the game is very easy to understand, and kids 3-5 will probably get the most out of it, counting the pieces of fruit whenever the arrow lands on the number. It's a fun game to play, and sometimes a game will take longer than you'd think if you constantly get the basket or either animal. I couldn't believe it when I got the dog and bird 7 times in a row, and my daughter got the basket three times in one game, so close to winning each time, only to have me finally win when I started to get numbers. She wasn't too happy with that.The only bad thing I can say about this game is that the construction is on the wimpy side. Several people have complained about the game board being flimsy, and I have to agree, though I just had the game box hold the board so it was more stable, and we played without any problems. It's somewhat thin though, and I can see it getting all bent up if hyper kids use it, but it all depends on the people using it. You get 11 of each fruit piece- 10 to put in the trees and 1 extra of each, which is great of them to do, but I can't help but wonder if 5 extra pieces would've been a safer choice given how easy it is to lose things of this size. Just be careful when playing and keep checking to make sure everyone has their pieces and you should be good.What more can I say? I highly recommend this game and wish it were around when I was little. But noooo...I was stuck with the panic attack-inducing Perfection instead.

  Great game for ages 2 +. My 2 year old loves it and plays it everyday. It’s great to teach counting and sorting colors. She also loves putting the small puzzle together which is small enough for a 2 year old to do on their own. I would use caution if you have a small child that tends to put things in their mouth. The tiny fruit pieces might look like candy to them. My little one doesn’t usually do this, but when we first got the game she pretended to bite the tiny fruit pieces. I had to warn her not to actually put them in her mouth!

  This version of Hi-Ho Cherry-O is more than I ever remember it being when I was a youth.  ""Back in the day"" when you played the game there was a distinct winner, and you CAN still play the game that way; however, to accommodate the sore losers, they have a collaborative playing option.  Good I suppose if you want to teach math skills without the drama of someone's feelings being hurt...?  Personally, I took the risk and played the game with my 4 year-old daughter the traditional way so she could learn that sometimes you win and sometimes you don't - how to be gracious if you do win and how to be tolerant if you aren't so lucky.  Overall a fun, simple game.

  Not the same game from my childhood.  No standing plastic trees with hook stem cherries.  It's a flat cardboard game with holes punched in the picture of the trees where the cherries sit.

Object of game is to spin the spinner on your turn and follow the instructions on the spinner board and remove the cherries from your tree before your opponents. First player to remove cherries from the tree is the winner.  All players can play together in a cooperative version as the ""house"" player (the board) tries to complete a puzzle before all the players remover their cherries from the tree. There are a lot of little pieces (plastic fruit) to store but it was fun and very simple to play in terms of rules..... Spin the spinner, remove the fruit based on the number of cherries that the spinner stops at and move on to the next player.

I rush into my kids room and see this shadow crash through the window. My dog has blood on his fur and the board is on fire!I pulled the curtains closed cause we all know sunflower colored drapes keep demons at bay and then turned to my kids. ""What did you do?"" I asked. They said they just wanted to talk to Santa and let him know what they wanted but my kid isn't the best at spelling (or doing chores for that matter) and I guess they maybe summoned Satan, or maybe just a demon.I don't know but I do know that you should take precautions when playing with board games.

Kids believe we are haunted

  I get it, it's just a game..oh but it is more than that for us..My kids think we are haunted and offer Zazzle and Fuji food from our kitchen. I eat it and they think the ghosts are eating it. The lights flicker on and off and the power blinks..because of the breakers in the garage, I OWN AT PLAYING THIS GAME.I scratch their bedroom door and tell them to listen to their elders and the kids believe the ghost.All because I bought a game on Amazon..

  Bought for paranormal investigations, but soon after my daughters and nephew an niece got ahold of it one night everything changed. Honestly I don't care who believes me. We hear footsteps every night at 11. We've had lights an tv come on an off in the middle of night when sleeping. I decided to buy motion sensor camera an caught a orb manifest from my bedroom an came down hallway at what time? 11pm you guest it. Last night me an my wife fell asleep on couch an around 11:45 I woke up to this glowing white figure standing over my wife, it's like I was paralyzed by this entity. Soon after it floats off down hallway and I hear 4 steps when no one was awake. I began yelling trying to get my wife awake , but she would not wake it's like she was in a trance or something after shaking her repeatedly she finally wakes up. That's the first time I've seen a spirit an it spooked me. I have played ouija before when I was 16 now 31 so it's been awhile.  My mom a house is still haunted from it, I had my bed shake uncontrollably twice an the second time a witness was with me. Not counting seeing shadow people an many other occurrences that my family encountered. WARNING ⚠️ PLEASE BE CAREFUL AN READ UP ON THE OUIJA BOARD BEFORE PLAYING THIS IS NO TOY.

  Arrived in perfect condition. Played with some friends and it didn’t seem to work. Days later however my house is now haunted by the ghost of what I believe is a very angry Trump supporter. I’m living a real life poltergeist situation. While watching cnn one night my tv turned off. Also one of my closets has become a portal to the otherside.  I hope I can save my dog who now barks from the ceiling now. Great buy if you hate CNN and your dog and don’t mind losing a spare room.

So far not believing the hype with these things

  Hi there. I am a practicing pagan of 16 years. I have read my fair share of books on this subject and have practiced many rituals in my time. I have studied shamanism, necromancy, elemental witch craft, and Wicca. Spanning cultures anywhere from Ancient Egypt, to Native American, Norse, Gaelic and Asian. My primary practice summed up is: Necromancy using Ancient Egyptian magick with a strong Wiccan base. I also use Tibetan singing bowls, and Native American smudging rituals using an abalone shell with sage. This cleanses your space of spirits and negative energy.My fiancé and I gave this board a go last night. I had my candles lit, positioned correctly, my necromantic spirit guide/skull, named Michael setup (See The Witches Book Of The Dead by Christian Day)- I even had Frankincense and myrrh incense going in front of the skull. We opened the conversation and proceeded to ask questions. I am not unfamiliar with speaking with spirits, it’s what I do. But the board was dead as a door nail. We had a moment where the candles began to flicker rapidly out of nowhere, after asking a question. That was about it so far.I realize these things can take several tries. We are going to try again around 3AM sometime. And we will try again after midnight as well. I have had more reactions from a candle alone than this board. Maybe our altars intimidate spirits. My god of choice is Anubis after all, and his job is to guide spirits to the underworld for the weighing of the ostrich feather vs the heart. We have seen entities in our apartment before, as well as items disappearing and a few poltergeists - I saw my shoe levitate off of the shoe rack and propel itself forward once. So we KNOW spirits have been here, and do pass through here.The board itself is rather small and flimsy. It seems to be made of cheap cardboard like material, with a cheap print of the ouija board glued around it.If we continue to get zero responses here, even under the next full moon, I may try taking it somewhere else to try it. I deliberately left the ouija board out unattended last night, and absolutely nothing happened you guys. No spooks, no curses, no stuff thrown all over the place . Just nothing. So I am skeptical (even against Christian day) that these are a viable means of communication with the dead.Mind you, I was an atheist for three years recently, so I am critical when observing supernatural phenomenon. I employ that analyzing process to my rituals, so no subconscious “BS” takes place. I feel like a lot of people on here are just moving the planchette themselves and are going through the subconscious motions that scientists use to debunk ouija boards.That being said, I can tell you I have in fact seen ghosts, I have seen entities and creatures with my own eyes that are definitely supernatural. And until I see or hear something as concrete as what I have already seen in my lifetime, I won’t call it a successful session. Wish us luck.Update: nothing happened over the full moon. Nothing at all. Honestly this board is further increasing my skepticism that any of it is real at all. My past experiences could have been over active imagination, crumbling under stress, lack of sleep. So many things to be honest. I am walking away from this board an atheist. Lmao

A legendary tool made with cheap plastic and cardboard.
","

  You'd think with such a legendary product with a storied history, Hasbro could at least offer a thin wood version rather than a cheap cardboard mat wrapped with a printed paper label and a white diecast plastic planchette. I mean, it's a game, but it's really not, know what I mean? There's a legend here, and the board should feel legendary. Ouija is labeled as a game for ""children 8+"" but this is not a toy to be monkeyed with. Several people have experienced very scary things with the symbolism even this cheap rendition may render. We do paranormal investigations on a TV show, and this board simply won't present well. We found a very old wooden one in a graveyard! Working on cleansing it and will use that one instead. This cheap one's getting burned. So disappointed.

Scary stuff happens
","

  I bought this last year for my best friend who lives 10 hours away... I never visited his house since buying it but whenever we were on facetime sketchy things would happen like footsteps from upstairs or shadows and random sounds.... He wasn’t scared so I ignored it... until I went to visit. He would leave me to go work and really weird stuff was happening, tv downstairs came on while I was upstairs, the PlayStation controller would skip around the show or movie that was playing on the tv when the controller was off and most importantly the door would fly open at random when it was closed and locked. WHILE I WAS THE ONLY ONE HOME. I chose to ignore this stuff and one day while putting away the sheets I opened the closet that the game board was in and I promise this closet was about 30 degree colder than the rest of the house... so yeah I guess you could say this is real.

It went over well, no contact was made with anything the first try, but when done with their cousin they made contact with Zuzu.

Long story short,because it was a long month for me and my sister ,believe it or not but a spirt did come out the bored 😑 and I’ve been talking to it every since. He mad cool tho lol. So FYI when the planchette goes around the bored and spelling abcs and counting its Time to close the bored. I learned that after he came out 😬🙏 Anyways, his name is no1. And this spirit is the best thing that ever happen to me. Me and no1 still play with the bored but hardly ever just because he doesn’t want any unwanted guests coming through the bored .

  I rarely post reviews on Amazon, however, I felt I had to do it on this item.  I'm an engineer and found it appalling at the lack of precision that these cheap plastic parts were made.  This is nothing like the old classic Mouse Trap game you played as a child where things actually worked and pieces were made of thick sturdy plastic!  This whole game is built around things fitting together crisply to make the game work.  One bent or poorly molded plastic piece and the game is essentially junk.  My recommendation is to look for an older used version on eBay.  This was junk and returned the same day I received it...where the part labeled ""thing a ma jig"" snapped onto a post that was angled instead of straight, making the second marble not fall properly.  Junk, junk. junk.

As They build the mousetrap by moving their mice across the board. They also try to collect cheese cards, which allow them to move other mice to cheese wheels which is the bait for the trap. Once the mouse trap has been completely constructed, players can attempt to capture each others' mice in it by setting off. the trap if the trap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game.

  Fun game to play at least once or twice but doesn't lend it self to much repeat play with older kids.  However It is fun to play with the mouse trap pieces for a few times.  Instructions are as complicated as the mouse trap but generally straight forward.  Although game is for 2-4 people we successfully played it with 5 by adding an extra piece.  Game is definitely  more fun when players  that have mixed level of mechanical ability.  Game relies on  functional assembly of the trap and  malfunctions add some excitement to game play.  It is not a game to just hand over to small kids as there are many small parts.  It is better to have an older game runner (adult or teen) that can interpret the rules and instructions when playing with younger children.

The course will not successfuly work!!! The marble at the top of the course will not roll forward no matter what we try. We even tried various tricks found on YouTube to make it work (tape over the marble hole, adjusting the ""helping hand"") and it has continued to fail and frustrate.So, if you want to re-live the most frustrating game of your own childhood, and pass this painful memory onto your children, go ahead and spend the money!I'm give 2 stars instead of 1 only for the fact that I was able to spend well over an hour of quality time with my son before it turned into a crying, frustrated meltdown...my son was pretty upset too!

And actually, when it comes down to it, this is also a pretty educational game since it teaches kids to follow instructions as well as what it takes and how it feels to construct something themselves. Although, just make sure they are supervised during play since there are plenty of tiny pieces that could become hazardous in the wrong hands >_<

It is perfect.My older sister had this game when we were growing up, but I didn't actually remember much of the actual gameplay. I didn't read the game instructions at all first. We popped open the box, dug out the assembly instructions, and pieced the whole game together first. I think it took 30 minutes or so. Then, I read the instructions and saw that you're supposed to build as you play the game. Oops. However, in hindsight, I'm actually really glad I made that mistake because by the time we actually played, we understood where everything went and were sure we had all the pieces. Plus, it really built up excitement for my son. He got how the game worked, and so he put up with the actual gameplay purely because he loved building and setting off the trap repeatedly.Therein lies my only gripe. He insists on setting off the trap every. single. time. one of us lands on the space to set it off, even if nobody is on the space to get caught, and it takes a couple minutes to put it all back together. For him, this is the absolute highlight. He delights in setting it off. For me, and my mom brain... it was initially just more work. But, again, I have never seen him so happy and so engaged in a board game in my life, so I kind of learned to delight in those moments too. He and his 10-year-old sister have now happily slaughtered me repeatedly.Other reviews mention the quality... we didn't have any issues and the pieces are as I remember them.  This will be in our collection for quite some time.

Fun game! Set up is Finicky.
","

  This game is so much fun! Just like I remembered from my childhood except for the colors of the board. Overall the contraption works, the only problems I had was with the stairs and the slide (the ball would get caught between the stairs and slide and you had to push it to continue on). I think the placement of the stairs and slide was a little off. The slide also wouldn’t stay all the way in the piece it connects to either. Also be warned The blue piece that the ball hits has to sit just right on the ledge or it won’t work.So it does really work but Is a bit finicky. I would not give this game to any child who gets frustrated easily.

So flimsy
","

  I loved this game as a child.  As an adult with two children, I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of this game.  The ball rarely makes it through without help.  The pieces don't line up right and there are parts that the ball never actually trips (the upward hand for example).  The kicking foot you can't install the parts exactly or it misses the cup.  You have to slightly twist the way they're sitting in order for the foot to make contact.  It's a real bummer when you are trying to show a  6 year old how to put things together then explain that they can't really put them together ""correctly""There seems to be different versions of mousetrap out there, the parts look different.  This particular one, I'd steer clear of.

  I rarely give low ratings, but this game deserves it. I bought this for my children with some old memories of playing when I was a child .. was disappointed right from opening the box that everything was plastic, and clearly of the cheaper mass-produced type. As we struggled through the first game, our enthusiasm kept going down .. from looking unsuccessfully for the rubber band that was supposed to be in the box, to scrambling to find another piece that we finally discovered in the garbage as it looked exactly like the throwaway plastic pieces that held the other cheap plastic parts.When we finally got to the point in the game when the mouse trap was built and someone finally hand to turn the crank ... nothing. The plastic parts had shifted on the board. So, reassembly and then I held the board down on the floor as my daughter turned the crank .. to watch the metal ball careen down the too-short track and in 2 seconds trip the trap.We put the game away, and went back to Monopoly.

  Really like the game. Just 1 gripe... The turn crank board spot... It's unclear on how this is played. Do you spam cheese on 1 turn or use 1 cheese once per turn or are you forced to move from that spot once you don't spend any cheese. The directions for this spot are horrendous.But other then that... The game is well made. I had no problems with any of the pieces and worked 100% of the time (15 trap triggers).

  I had this game as a child and the kids got it for Christmas this year.  They love it!  We all like to play it together.  The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that the part of the trap that is shaped like a hand on a pole and is meant to knock the ball further down the track does not work very well.  It can be very frustrating for the kids after numerous attempts to set it.

Lousy quality

  Why are board games made with such lousy quality today?!?!  I feel like all board games are cheap and have gone down hill in this age.  Do manufacturers not realize KIDS play with board games so should at least be made with some durability for a game that is supposed to be played over and over again?  Plastic pieces cheap and flimsy.  Doesn't exactly match all the cardboard pieces.  The little ball and cage with boot also does not work well and needs some assistance most of the time to even work properly.

  Upon opening Mousetrap on Christmas morning, I helped my (overly excited  11yo) grandson begin to set it up. He couldn’t wait to “play the retro games, and other presents” I purposely bought. We were 1/4 of way into the setup, and couldn’t find 1 part. Everything that came in the box, along with directions remained on the table. It was not there. Bottom line, the piece that was not included, and an attempt at a facsimile was not to be. He reassured me it was “ok” when it was not, instead of.returning the game et al, it ended up in the trash.

  I have great things to say about this game! THe great thing about Mousetrap is that it's more than a board game. You can build the maze gradually, following the manufacturer's instructions, or you can simply assemble the maze and use it as a toy. My son is 7 and we built the maze together yesterday. He wants to keep it assembled in his room and is busy integrating all his other toys into the maze.We worked together to build it (he has more spatial sense than I do...it's not that a 7 year old CAN'T do it, it's just that it takes two people to figure it out together). So it was a great exercise in teamwork.I have read reviews that the materials are flimsy and not sturdy, but I disagree. The pieces are made of thick, durable plastic and cannot be bent or easily broken.Best. game. ever!

Magic Mirror Murders? Sure, Hasbro ...
","

  I received this game as a gift, since anyone who knows me also knows how much I love a new Clue game.90 — 95% of this edition is exactly what Hasbro has already been selling for 2 years now (linked in the comments below): an attractively updated Clue game featuring the new suspect Dr. Orchid, and a return to the classic board design (after spending the better part of a decade with a scaled down, modernized board, this is certainly a welcome feature). The biggest draw to this edition comes from the inclusion of fully sculpted character pieces (already available in international editions of Hasbro’s Cluedo games, but woefully absent from our North American Clue games, which were saddled with the generic pawns Clue has featured for decades). These are a fun aesthetic upgrade from the prior edition’s pawns.The next big new thing is, clearly, the card-revealing mirror. This replaces the solution envelope of past editions with a battery operated magic mirror to reveal the Who, What, and Where of Mr. Boddy’s murder. It’s a sturdy chunk of plastic, but is it worth the price tag on this new edition? Not at all. Hasbro hasn’t even bothered to integrate the mirror into the narrative of the game. Where, in the house, is this magic mirror? Why does it know the solution to the crime? Players will have to be creative, or just suspend their disbelief a little more while playing the game.It’s too early to tell if this is meant to replace the previous edition as Hasbro’s standard offering for Clue players, or if it will be sold alongside the “analog” version as a deluxe alternative. Most players will be fine sticking with whichever edition of Clue they’ve been playing for decades. Anyone in the market for a new edition should use their own judgment to decide if fancier playing pieces & the gimmick of the mirror are worth paying almost 2x the cost of the original Dr. Orchid edition.Pros:-Character pieces-Larger box-Some integrated storage within the box for tokens & mirrorCons:-Board/cards/notepad must be stored under the box insert, with no way to secure the cards from scattering inside the box-No batteries? No mirror effect for you-Bonus deck still limited to just 9 cards while the international editions have 29 in this deckNeutral:-The mirror will draw in younger players, but is otherwise a very half-baked “upgrade” which doesn’t justify the MSRP

  I came across this item by accident. I mean I'm a huge Clue fan and buy any official board game that Hasbro makes. But this one did not come up on my normal search. I stumbled across it and instantly added it to my shopping cart and bought it. The magic mirror is basically a blank until you push the button and a light inside illuminates the 3 cards inside revealing whodunit. The playing pieces are not little small nubs but rather human shaped in their respective characters. The board is the same as the 2017 version with Dr. Orchid. All in all the magic mirror is a nice touch and I look forward to Hasbro making more versions of Clue. The other reviewer is 100% wrong. Getting tired with the crappy reviews. Leave it alone!Hasbro if you're listening: Clue Master Detective a 2018 or 2019 edition would be nice! There are a huge number of fans that want a new updated Clue Master Detective!

Overpriced for what it adds to the basic edition also available for $10 less.
","

  I paid $10 for this game when it was on sale over Black Friday. Except for the “card revealing mirror”, and character figurines instead of generic pawns, this is the exact same game as the original, square, under $10 edition also available on Amazon. The card revealing mirror certainly does not justify the price. The character figurines are definitely a step up from the original edition (from which they were omitted, despite the Cluedo edition including them), though $10 is a pretty steep price for some little plastic figurines.Combined with the mirror gimmick, it may be worth it to make the game more interesting for kids, as evidenced by some of the comments here. However, I can not recommend paying $20 for the exact same game which Hasbro continues to sell for only $10. The less expensive version is also in a smaller box for storage, while the larger box doesn’t really improve the way then prices are stored and protected, they still roll around inside the box, unlike the Cluedo counterpart which has plastic compartments.All things considered, this is an edition with some extra bells and whistles, which may, or may not be worth the added expense for you. That said, if you can find it for the same price as the original square version, as I did, then you should buy it instead — it’s well worth it for the character figurines. Though the mirror falls squarely into gimmick territory, it might be a fun addition for young children; but some of you, like me, may find yourself wishing they’d included the good old fashioned paper evidence envelope as well.

It definitely brought back some of my childhood memories since I played this when I was younger too. I love that it was a good mix of old and new.

Other than that, it was a lot of fun playing and it's great that it's a family-friendly game.

Finally another version with figurines!
","

  As serious players over the years... We really liked this version!The figurines are very useful, specially if you use the rule of bringing the suspect to the room they are ""suggested"" (they were always kinda hard to find with the typical Sorry pieces).The mirror looks cool, but sometimes the light let's you peek the cards inside even though it isn't on. Therefore it ended always turned upside down haha. We didn't mind at the end, since it makes no effect on the gameplay.The best part overall... this version brings again the best board ever! Also, the Clue cards bring extra variation, which let us play faster and with every type of person (specially when mixing adults and children).In other words, this is one of the best versions out there! The figurines, the board and the cards are well enough for giving the 5 stars. The unhuman-colored figurines and the mirror could be better, but make no effect on the game.Thanks!

Great Gift
","

  Bought this as a gift for a 14 year old who had never played Clue before this summer and he enjoyed it. I like the updated pictures and board and the magic mirror was lots of fun. Our favorite part is the pawns are people shaped and color coded to match the characters they represent, so that was fun. If we didn't already have 3 different Clue games I might have bought one for myself.

A blast from my past!
","

  This was one of my favorite childhood games and it's so fun being able to play this with my 6 year old! The key for him being able to play independently is that he's able to read. He doesn't quite understand the strategy part of it yet but he can follow the basic process of elimination. The board looks pretty similar to the one I played growing up. There is a new character (Dr. Orchid). We all LOVE the magic mirror feature. It just makes it a little more fun that flipping over the winning cards.

  I actually despise this game lmao but my daughter (11 years old) wanted it for Christmas so we got it for her. She wanted the DVD version and in my rush to get all the gifts I thought this was the one because of the magnifying glass on the front, I thought it was a DVD but that's my fault for just glancing. But she's still happy and we play it and it's great.

  Cool update to the game. Similar to the original with a few improvements. Pawns are in the shape of the characters, instead of a confidential folder there is a mirror that shows the cards with the push of a button. They also added a few alternate ways to play if you want! Love it.

Borne out of Boredom During WWII Air-Raid Blackouts

  This is one of the classics. The game was first manufactured by Waddingtons in the UK in 1949 so it has really stood the test of time.  It was called Cluedo in England and Clue in the United States.  Definitely not a mindless game which is why I have always enjoyed it.  Purchased it for a game tower for a fundraiser.  Packaged well and enjoyable especially if you like murder mysteries.

  This game reminds you of 'Eye to Eye' which is by far the most popular game in my extended family. Why? Because the rounds are quick, the rules are simple, the connections between players are unpredictable and rewarding, and you don't have to 'invest' hours and multiple plays to 'get the idea'. Some of us are not into the deep game playing strategies that require deep involvement and considerable attention; we just want to socialize and have fun conversations . This game meets all the expectations for something that does not require time and space to set up and can be played impromptu with anyone. We played 4 player, 6 player  at a recent family vacation an appreciated the ability to just pick it up whenever and wherever circumstances allowed, teens and kids loved it too; no prep. Awesome!

  The game is really quite easy and fun for groups of all ages! Great party game!The lower rating is mainly due to the fact that this was purchased as a gift but it arrived to our house without any exterior plastic/box/etc. The shipping labels were stuck right on the outside of the game box and they were NOT easy to get off which isn't ideal (especially when gifting),

  The markers must be of a cheap quality because we were left with ink on our fingers, but the gameplay concept and replay ability is excellent.  I bought this game with the hopes that our 6 year old niece would have a better chance at playing the game independently instead of being a ‘helper’ On game nights.  I do agree with the rating of 8+ years old, but boy does she have fun as a player.  Some games her simple mind came up with the best answer out of a tableful of adults.

  We have hundreds of games, so believe me when l tell you, this game is amazing!  Played with kids 7, 10 & 11 and they all loved it. They've just recently outgrown Sleeping Queens that we've played to death. Dragonwood is the perfect next step up. Thank you Gamewright! There's a reason l have almost all of their games. They know what they're doing in game design. The dice are gorgeous, the card art is great. You really feel like you're walking through a magical wood capturing spooky spiders, finding enchantments and battling a fierce blue dragon.

  Our boys received Dragonwood, Dungeon, and Pathfinder as Christmas gifts.  They are 4, 6, 8, & 16.  Our family loves board games and we really wanted to encourage their storytelling skills and imagination.  This game was very easy to learn and teach to each of the boys.  Although the 4 year old played on my team, he would make up a story to go wit each attempt to capture.  Although we used the words capture, the boys eventually told stories that went beyond just capturing the characters on the card.  We also named each of the  cards a special name of their own - The Enchantress, The Wizard, the Dark Knight, The Light Night, & The Elf.  It made for consistency across the stories being told by each boy on his turn.  The pictures are fantastically illustrated and the cards have a very nice feel.I did notice that another review complained about the directions for this game.  I found the directions very clear and well illustrated.  Our boys who are all solid readers, still preferred to reference the picture in the directions of what constitutes a Strike, Stomp, or a Scream.  Once we had the basic directions down, we added the bit about telling a story to coincide with the cards being played and acted upon and we had played 3 games before bedtime just that first night.  When I came home from work today, I found that the boys had been playing this game all morning on their own!  This is a really fun game.

  We have had Sleeping Queens for a while and the whole family loves it. This is a great step up for a family wanting a slightly more involved game. Easy to learn and understand, and it comes with two reference cards to remind you of your play options each turn which was helpful for the kids. My 6 and 9 year old both loved it!

Great Math Mechanics
","

  This a fantastic early elementary level math/probability/push your luck game. The premise is simple: Choose a monster card you want to capture.  You can theb play one to six cards of the same number, in a run, or in a flush. You then roll dice equal to the number of cards played. You then total the Dice and compare it to the monster card. Equal to or higher wins you the card.  It's simple enough for my six year old to play (with help from me) against my wife, and it clearly is teaching her the basics theories of probability and early ideas of ""push your luck"" versus ""play it safe strategies.""  Once she has another year of school down, she should have no problem playing it on her own against us.  Oh, and my wife wanted to play it with me once the kids were in bed as a nice light distraction game!  A huge A++ for quality math based mechanics, with another + thrown in for cute art.

  My 9 year old son bought this game after playing it at church. The pastor's kids brought it one Sunday and they played it in lieu of Sunday school (clutch your pearls everyone!! lol). It's a fun game that gives the feeling of daring and challenge combined with strategy, but easy enough that you don't have to be a perfect strategist to do well. My kids are 6, 7 and 9 and they can all play it. I was actually surprised by how quickly they caught on to the complexities, but they also play Minecraft and other strategy games so they're used to this sort of thing. This is a great game for ""inbetweeners"" that are too old for Candy Land and too young for Risk. For them it feels like a ""grown up"" game, but it's well designed for young minds. For the educational minded, this game is good for math skills as well as logic and reasoning. It also encourages long term planning if you want to do well when a dragon strikes! My oldest quickly figured out to save a great hand to be ready for a dragon.The only reason I don't give it five stars is that once you get going it's rather redundant. You're pretty much doing the same thing again and again. But for kids it's fine. As an adult it gets old.  ;)

  My 7 yr old son and I just received this game and have played it twice already.  He needs a little help to get through it, but he loves the game already.  He is fascinated with the artwork and creatures enough to be trying to read and quickly add up the dice on his own.  He is a fairly reluctant reader and usually avoids reading even simple things so I am delighted this has caught his attention enough to make him excited to read and quickly add as well as think critically about the simple strategy.  As a homeschool family, we are always on the lookout for fun games that reinforce concepts we are learning and this fits the bill! (Having 6 dice makes for great math).  The game is really lovely and simple enough to play enjoyably from the start.

Great Strategy & Fun for Family & Friends Alike!
","

  After playing Dragonwood over 30 times in the first week, I think it is safe to post a review.  First of all, this game is extremely easy to learn from the instruction manual, and even easier to teach others how to play.  I have played this game with my wife, my two sons (11 & 9), and 3 other friends who are into strategy games.  It is so easy to pick up and play.  It is a good mix of deck building, random dice rolling and strategy.  It stays fresh enough that you can keep playing, without boring, at least for 2-3 times in a setting.  The art style is simple and elegant, and a great attraction to anyone who is into medieval style.  The game experience is equally fun for 2-4 players.  The instructions include 2-3 variants as well for more experienced players.  I have not attempted those yet but look forward to doing that soon.

Slow going and unbalanced
","

  You will note in the photo I have included that the Hungry Bears, Pack of Wolves, Wild Boar and Fierce Jaguar are all worth 3 victory points.  Capturing these however, is different for each.  The 'strike' method of capture has 3 different amounts; 1 is 6 1 is 7 and 2 are 8 to capture.  For the 'Stomp"" method they have two amounts; 2 have 7 and 2 have 6.  Finally for the 'Scream"" method there are again three amounts, 7, 8 and 9.The three methods of capture, scream, strike and stomp all have the same odds of being gathered in the needed order to use them.  The amounts needed to capture should be based on the VP of the card in question not randomly selected per card.  This would allow for a balanced game.Next, for the level of this game, the game play is rather slow.  We got so bored in the first game that we lost interest and did not complete the first game.  A game this simple should be much faster paced, the Lucky Ladybugs are an attempt to do this and while they do add a bit of speed to the game it is still slow.In short, I was hopeful that this would be a good fast or at least quick game that could be used to entertain and teach on a lazy afternoon and used as an alternative to electronic entertainment.  It failed at a very slow pace that was grueling and not fun.  We were disappointed.

  My GOSH my 7 year old son is obsessed with this game. We recently (in the last several months) became a major gamer family. It's a way to bond with my 4 and 7 year old sons. This is one of many games I purchased and by far the one that is most played. Now, for me personally - I can get bored with this one. But it is just right for my 7 year old. My 4 year old also plays but I often need to remind him of sequences for the 3 methods of attack. He tends to use the ""Scream"" most of all because it's easier for him to remember to use the same color. But he still has a lot of fun. This game can go on for a LONG time too. I have gotten to the point I remove many cards out of the event deck so we have a shorter play time.The dice are lovely red and smooth. The card artwork is pretty. The entire box and set up is well made and just nice quality. We've definitely played our money's worth out of it already.

Good game but very easy - with default rules
","

  The first several tries this game was very fun, but we soon learned to draw cards until we had enough for a 6 card Strike. Once you have that, you can breeze through the whole Creature deck with no resistance... making the game so easy it isn't really fun anymore. However, with a couple minor rule changes it can be challenging and fun again.1. Don't end the game when both dragons are captured, play through the whole deck.2. Don't use all 6 dice for normal capture attacks. Use only 4, with exceptions for the single-use Enhancement cards that act as an extra card or dice. This makes capturing upper level creatures difficult and requires players to use the different capture methods and Enhancements.With those minor fixes to the rules, this game is fantastic for kids and adults. Highly recommended!

Strategy, chance and dragons!
","

  Gamewright makes a lot of cool games. As my boy gets older, I like to get games with more complexity and strategy. (Can’t wait until he’s 10 so I can get Forbidden Island!) Dragonwood is super! We received it two days ago and have already played it several times. A friend of mine (an adult) and I just played it. She took a photo of the box because she wants to get it for herself. I would suggest to the company that rather than strike, stomp or scream, they change it to strike, shoot (with an arrow) or cast spell. After all, the cards have swordspeople, archers and sorcerers. Nobody has heavy boots that we can see, and no one looks angry, so why all the stomping and screaming? This is where house rules come in. Great game! Oh, and nice box, too. :)

Another instant favorite from Gamewright
","

  My 8 (almost 9) year old daughter LOVES this game. This, Fabled Fruit, and Sleeping Queens are her favorites, and mine as well. When we first opened it she didn't think she would like it because the artwork isn't as ""fun"" as other cards, but she quickly decided it did have some pretty good stuff. Like a Unicorn and mages and things. This game requires some basic math and a bit of planning/strategy. While the instructions have it set  up to be a competitive game, we often play cooperatively; if both dragons are slain we have decided that means we both win. Highly recommend this game if your child enjoys games that require thought and effort over luck.

Fun to play with a 2nd grader
","

  Fun to play with a 2nd grader and casual players. Takes at least 45 minutes unless you have experienced and quick deciding players. Shadow cloak item is a little over-powered, but you can take it out as a house rule. Rules should probably be worded to say that the ""successful capture party has to escort the creature out of the forest"" so that it is clear from the first reading that you must discard them. We played for the first few times that you kept your team, and it got a little ridiculous with a 6 card attack every time.I like that you remove some cards from the deck each game, so each playthrough has a different balance of items and creatures. Also, shrieking at creatures to capture them (by shear force of will/lung power?) is a fun idea.

Spot on for 10 year old!
","

  Read lots of reviews before buying this and agree with the positive reviews.  This is perfect for 9-10 year olds.  We watched a Youtube video to see how to set it up because I just learn better that way than reading the instructions but I think the instructions are sufficient for most adults.  I was a little confused from reading only the instructions which deck I was supposed to be removing 12 cards from to begin with but I got it when I watched the Youtube video.  (There are lots out there from which to pick btw.)My 10 year old could not figure out how to play it by reading the instructions herself so kids probably will need an adult to explain it and play it a few times before leaving them to play with other kids their age.Well thought-out game.  After playing it twice, I started pointing out to my daughter about probability and risks/chance and she started catching onto this concept little by little so I do think this game is accurate in stating that it teaches probability.We have never played the previous game that others referred to in other reviews so I can't attest to the game that was prior to this one for younger players.Yes, this game is totally fun with just 2 people!  Sometimes games say 2-4 players and then just aren't as fun with 2, but this one is just as fun with 2 as it would be with 3-4 players.  Younger siblings (ages 6-7) could play along with assistance from an adult also, and I think, still have fun with it.My only suggestion for improvement is tweaking the written instructions for setting up the game (which deck was which) but again, this may have just been me not learning well from reading, to be fair.One more thing- the length of time it takes to complete the game is also spot on for this age group.  We played 2 games and I would say it was between 40-50 mins for each one- and that's partly because we are beginners and had to refer back to the instructions several times to check that we were following them correctly.Glad I bought this!  I usually buy second hand games from Goodwill or yard sales so this was a little on the expensive side for me but I think it's worth the money!

  I picked this up and it was exactly as I hoped... I great and fun game with simple rules to just open it up and play. My family (4yo-37yo) had a blast playing this game! You can determine roughly if it's a short game or longer game by how many cards you remove before starting (great for right before bedtime). My 4yo needed some help knowing it was not a good idea to go after certain monsters with only 2-3 dice. :)We're still trying to memorize the different actions you can take depending on the cards you have but they also include at least 2 cards you can leave on the table as reference so you're not staring in the rule book every other turn.Ended up being a fun night for all of us and even though I'm the dragon fanatic Mom won by defeating both dragons herself. Who would have thought out of everyone in the room that Mom would be the dragon slayer!? Wait a second... Moms can handle anything :DIn all seriousness it is a very fun and easy to learn game for the whole family!

  Just finished our first game of this.  My son and I loved it.  It feels like a streamlined version of Munchkin with random chance (dice rolls).  My wife hates Munchkin.  She desperately wanted to hate this too, but ended up really enjoying it because of the mix of cards and dice and simplicity.  Gameplay is very straightforward and by the second or third turn you're going without having to figure out the rules anymore.  Gameplay for three people learning the game was about 20-30 minutes.  Offers good replayability because of the random chance element and after the first game it is apparent there is some strategy you can wield.

Great artwork, easy to learn, good replay value
","

  Component quality is a solid 5 star.  The artwork is gorgeous.  The game itself is easy to learn.  On your turn, you choose from the available creatures to attack.  You collect cards into runs(strike), sets(stomp), or flushes(scream).  The number of cards you play is the number of dice you can roll.  The if your total points on the dice is equal or greater than the defense of that creature, then you defeat them and collect the trophy points for that creature.  At the end of the game, player with the most trophy points wins.This game exceeded my expectations.  It looks simple.  There's luck, but definitely more skill is required.  The game could be taught in a matter of 2 minutes.  The game is great in every way....but....This is one of those games where after you play the first time, you'll start making your own house rules.  The rules state that on your turn you can pick up a card or play cards for an attack.  Our first game or two had several turns where we just went back and forth picking up cards until one of us had enough to play.  We preferred these house rules to keep the game going faster and more fun:- Everyone starts with 5 cards- On your turn, you can either pick up 1 card or lay down 1 or more cards for an attack.- If you attack and win, you draw cards until you have at least 5 cards in your hand.- If you attack and loose, you do NOT draw cards at the end of your turn (there's no 1 card penalty)- There's no limit to the number of cards you can hold.  There's a rule that states you may not hold more than 9 cards, but we saw no reason for such a limit.  It makes little sense to hold that many cards.  We found it best to eliminate the rule just to keep the rule list shorter.- Ladybug cards are not played until the start of your turn.  If you pick up a ladybug card at the end of your turn, you must wait until your next turn to use it.  You can also save ladybug cards if you wish.- Ladybug cards could either be used to draw two more cards from the deck or played as a wild card as part of your hand (optional).  There's already a wild card in the creature deck, but because it's a one time use card, it's power isn't very balanced compared to other enhancement cards.With these rule modifications, the game tends to go faster.  As a result, we eliminated the end game rules.  We play until every creature has been defeated.  This was also due to the fact that my daughter wanted to play through the whole deck of creatures.The basic mechanics and artwork make this a 5 star game, but the rules and some of the cards didn't seem very balanced.  More could be done with the enhancement cards in regards to balance and usage.  Definitely a solid game that lends itself to house rules to keep it interesting.  Fast and simple.  My daughter loved it.

  Purchased this game for my 7 year old grandson to introduce him to gaming. He actually loves it and is one of his top requested games to play.We've played with 2-4 players and I find it best with 3. The cards are good quality and don't need sleeves, the quick reference cards have good pictures so even if your gamer can't read, they can still understand. Younger kids may need a helpful partner to make choices or wait to build up your hand of cards at times, or add up the dice values, but it is very easy to learn and play.As he's played more and is now almost 8, I can see improvements in his strategy and decision making, improving the game play for everyone 😁I've played it with just adults as well and is great for light game between other games or as an intro game for newbies.

  I got this for my 7.5 year old niece.  The game is easy for an adult to learn quickly, and even easier to teach your young ones.  The game incorporates mathematics, strategy, fantasy and fun all rolled into one game.  The artwork on the cards is very nice.  You are role playing as an adventurer trying to vanquish magical creatures, and you get points for defeating harder creatures.  You basically draw cards, try to find either a ""run"" (at least 3 numbers in a row), the same colors (at least 3) or the same numbers (at least 3).  Then you get to roll dice for how ever many cards you played.  The game has pre-set end conditions so that it can't last forever, and I found games could last anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes depending on the conditions you choose (short or long game).  My niece was able to understand the more subtle nuances of the game fairly quickly and I believe it also helped her with her math skills and cause/effect/consequence strategic thinking.  Plenty of fun to be had though because you're slaying dragons and collecting magical gear during  the game.  As an adult, I also found it to be challening and fun for a kid's game.  I highly recommend this game.

Bridge from kid to adult game
","

  Enjoyable.  Good bridge from kid games to adult games.  The cards you are trying to capture change how and when they come out from game to game which helps replay.  Only complaint is my daughter was more advanced in game play some haven't gotten that much use out of it.  If you are a casual game playing family I would say recommended age of 8+ is good.  If you are advanced kids might lose interest right after 8 if they want a challenging game.

  Love it.  Very easy to learn and my 6-year-old beat us the first time we played.  We were hoarding cards and being conservative while he was collecting all the easy points.  In the end he won.  We played this in our gaming group with adults and tweens and they enjoyed it.  I'm surprise it's so cheap to get.  Other games I like are King of Tokyo, Munchkin, Survive: Escape From Atlantis, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, etc. just to give you an idea of my taste.  It's not a heavy game at all.  But not too kiddy to bore adults to death.

Very cool game!

  I tend to be a 'heavier' gamer (I really like complex games...), and filler games don't hold my interest most of the time.  My wife got this for me for last xmas, and we've played it 2, 3 and 4 player now several times.  What a cool game!  It is light enough that it is easy to teach, but it has enough meat to it that we enjoyed it very much (anyone that has played it with us, as well).  The age rating on the box is perfect.  My 6 year old daughter would  have a hard time with decisions that would have to be made, but I can see an 8 year old doing just fine.  The youngest that I have played with, though, is my 13 year old son, so that thought is pure speculation (and, of course, every kid is different!!!)....All in all:  Highly recommended!!!

  This game has been a delight to play with my 7 year old son. It's not a boring move your peg kind of game you can really enter the story and adventure created with each play. The pieces are quality material with vibrant colors. There is strategy to be learned but also luck. It makes the game fun up until the last play. We love imagining the attack plans and having fun with it.  The reference cards for each play are so helpful and make learning the game so much easier. It takes a few hands to get the idea and hang of the game just like any other game, but it is well worth it. Anyone we have shared this with has enjoyed playing it.

  We got this to interest our 6 year old in games. He loved it and we played every day for the first week. He was so interested in the game he sounded out all the creature names and the cards. It’s been a struggle to get him to want to read so this was a huge side benefit. It turned the corner on the whole thing. He loves the game so much that he chose to give one to a friend for his birthday. We all enjoy this game. It is simple enough for a kindergartner and still fun for his parents (one of which loves games of all kinds and one really does not but we both enjoy this). This game energized the family enough to want to play games every night.

Great time and easy to play - learn strategy and dice counting

  Bought so my 8 yr old son and I could play and get some good 1:1 time. This is a great game and not difficult to play with the exception the child needs to be able to sort cards into 3 options: colors, numerical sequence or same number. Play is fairly quick 20-25 mins for us and his reasoning skills are going to improve because he is upset that I have beat him all 3 games we have played. He goes for the featured cards and they can make you more successful but he goes for too many. Overall great game and good theme - it’s about capturing the creatures rather than kill or destroy. If the price stays close to $15 then a great gift idea.

  This is a great fight the goblins and witches and scary animals and dragons game. Lots of fun. The cards are nice, the powers are helpful so get those cards if you can.

I can’t remember if they can be combined or if the new one basically replaces this one but if the new one is a standalone, check that one out first as it seems, from my somewhat hazy memory, lol, that it has some more interesting choices.

Really fun game, great for an 8 yr old (and me), definitely need some luck to win
","

  My 8 yr old loves this game and so do I. It has really taught him to balance risk vs reward and to consider chance as a big part of the strategy. So far we've played maybe 25 times and we'll take a much more conservative approach some games and others more chances. We've managed to go through the deck twice to end the game maybe 1/3 of the time, the other times ending early by capturing both dragons. Not sure how often folks encounter that in a 2-player game though I imagine the more conservatively you play the game the more likely you are to run out of play. We will definitely be looking for more games as fun as this one.

Great family game
","

  Our family learned this one in one or 2 nights and it has become a favorite. We have 2 adults and 2 7-year olds. It is easy enough for kids to grasp but still engaging for adults, and plenty of luck involved so anyone can win. The kids did not know card games (like rummy or poker) that are a foundation for the card aspect of this game, but they picked it up. My only quibble is that the box suggests a game may take 20 minutes. It seems to take us much longer because Dad is very mathematical and wants to calculate the probability of every possible outcome for his turn and for the kids he’s helping. It is still fun, it just takes a long time.  It is a great tool for teaching probability.

  My family and I were getting bored with the same old games we've had for years. This was new and a lot of fun! It kept them entertained the whole time, and also sharpened their math skills. It's really well done, and engaging once you get the hang of it. I would say its definitely a game for kids older than like 10 or so because it can be a little complex. I did have trouble trying to figure out the set up and instructions, so it helped a lot to watch some YouTube tutorials on how to set up the board and play. Overall was a good buy, and we plan on buying more from the same company.

But my 3 boys regularly request it and it is easy enough we can all play (3, 5, 7 yr olds) and include non gamer neighbors or grandparents.I should note we always modify play for the 3 yr old.Basically you draw cards till you have some kind of set like a 4,5,6 or cards of same color or same number. Then you get the opportunity to roll the dice to capture one of the animals or powers that are out on the table. The 3 yr old plays cards up so we can help.4 stars simply for how much it gets played even when parents are not are around.

Great for learning strategy - Engages children who enjoy fantasy
","

  This game entails capturing “creatures” with different strategies. You are using cards and dice to catch different creatures. This was bought for a six yr old so with slight modifications to the rules he can play this and finds it very engaging. It is giving him a good understanding of different card strategies like learning what runs are, or understanding you need all the same color or number for this “attack”. Also, you have to look at the card you want to go for a see what attach is most effective and if you have the cards to support that attack. It takes some math that goes slightly beyond him sometimes because he is more focused on catching creatures but it definitely makes him think and he loves to play this game. As an adult I actually don’t mind playing this game. I think it usually takes us 45 min to play a game through.

  I bought this game for my 6 year old son and he loves it. He often asks to play this game. My wife and 16 year daughter also enjoy playing this game. The game is fairly easy to understand, though I did find it easier to pull up a YouTube video showing the basic mechanics than trying to read through the rules which could be a little clearer written. My son quickly picked up on the basic mechanics and after one game playing as a team he picked up all the rules and was ready to play by himself. The cards artwork looks great. My only knock against the game is it would be nice if their was a little more variety with some of the low power monsters, but it is a minor thing that definitely doesn't take away from the game.

My 8 y/o's new favorite game!
","

  WARNING- 2ND Grade math and dice are involved!The game has a quick set up time and doesn't take up a lot of space. The 6 dice it comes with are solid. I'm a huge fan of games that employ an educational aspect and the math involved with adding the dice is perfect for her. The math is about as complex as  a chance roll in Yachtzee(adding up to 6 individual dice between 1 and 4).The game is great for teaching rules and the flow of a turn as well. While the concepts are pretty general and simple for someone who has been playing games and card games for years, the mechanics can be a lot to take in. An example turn goes has the following steps:Choose to attack or drawA- Draw: if you end the turn w/ more than 9 cards in hand, discard down to 9B- Attack: Choose what you are attacking from the landscape, either an enhancement or a creature card. They will have a strength based on your attack typeChoose one of three different attack types based on the cards in your handRoll the number of dice equal to the number of cards you are attacking withAdd up your roll and any enhancements. If your result is greater than the attacked card, you win the attacked card and discard the cards you used to attack. If your result is lower than the attacked card, you discard a card.The reason our games drag on has nothing to do with the complexity of the game and everything to do with the child. If your 8 y/o is like mine, she agonizes over every decision on what action she should take, shakes the dice 1 million times and blows on them before she rolls the dice off the table, doesn't have the attention span to follow whether or not it's her turn, can't remember to discard cards in play after winning a roll, and feels the need to count the cards in her hand every single turn(so as not to go over the maximum number of cards).Still a great game!

Very simple concept and easy to follow for 9 year old.
","

  Purchased as present for my 9 year old, he loves it, we played about 4 times the same day he got it. Very simple game play, but stratagy is an important factor in winning.  There are two types of cards, ""attack"" cards and ""creature/enchantment"" cards, the attack cards are similar to playing cards with numerical values that have no real meaning other than to form different attack combos. The combos are called ""stomp"" ""strike"" and ""shout"" you use all the same number for one type, numerical order for one type, and all the same color for the third type. The creature cards have 4 values one them, three of the values are more or less their hit points, either stomp, strike, or shout.They are different and some times a shout works best, other times strike or stop. e.g. the ""Fire ants"" are weak to a stomp attack. The 4th value is called ""Victory Points"" this is the points you want to get to increase your chance to win.That is where the strategy comes in, you can attack a lot of small points monsters, or the larger points, but that uses more of your attack cards. You have to weigh the pros and cons of this because the games goes until the two dragons are defeated.I've managed to win, numerous times because I got two or three high point cards and my son and wife only went after multiple small point cards.Overall very happy with this game, very much recommend. It seems like it can be a good gateway to more advanced battle card games like Magic The Gathering when the kiddos get a little more adept at the strategy aspect of it all.

  I bought this for my 4 year old son because I remember playing this game as a child.  Unfortunately, they don't make things like they used to.  The quality of this toy is incredibly poor.The game itself is made of a cheap, thin plastic that easily bends when in use.  The Hippos necks get consistently stuck in the ""lunge"" position and you need to stop the game to fix at least one Hippo during each round. In addition, the cheap, plastic marbles get stuck in the Hippos necks so they stop ""eating"" the marbles during the game unless you reach in and try to pry the marbles loose.In order to set up the game you need to take each Hippo off of the bottom of the board and attach it to the top as everything is stored on the underside of the game.  The effort that it takes to set up and store this game properly means that my 4 year old can't play it without my help.  I can't imagine that the game will last much longer with any type of heavy use.

The inside of the hippos does not have enough slope to make the light weight marble roll all the way through the hippo, so they get stuck up in the neck of the hippo.You have to disassembled the game (remove all of the hippos) to fit it in the box provided which is SO impractical because my son will need to ask me to assemble it anytime he wants to play.I wish I could get my 1980's version of this game back.

  As long as this game has been around you would think they would make a better investment into it. First, it has no storing box. The box it comes in you can't use to store it in.

Also, the lever for munching should be more kid proof, it's small and off, not really good for a toddler. The board seems warped and so one hippo usually gets pretty lucky each feeding session.

We all played this for an entire evening and then the two kids- 5 and 8- kept playing with it for the rest of the weekend. And they were really rough on it, pounding on the hippos, launching the balls, etc. I finally had to put it away and while that process was more extensive than it should be, it all came apart just fine. I may be one of the few, but I'm really happy with it. Make sure you read the instructions, the necks lock intentionally for storage and if you overfill a ball reservoir you'll get one stuck up in the hippo's neck.

  My kids were so excited when we got this and set it up... 2 of the 4 hippos worked great.. The other 2 were extremely hard to press down..

Not like I remember it
","

  I remember playing this game as a kid.  I loved it so I bought this to play with my son.  He loves it, but I can't help but be disappointed.  I remembered the game being bigger and sturdy.  This game is flimsy.  The game board seems much smaller than I remember it.  The hippos are cheaply assembled.  When you really get going and start hammering on the lever, it gets caught up and the hippo's head gets stuck out in the middle of the game board.  The whole thing wobbles back and forth.  The marbles aren't even marbles.  They are plastic balls, and there aren't near as many as I remembered.  Although that is probably good because there isn't enough room to collect more than 10 or 12 at a time.It fills the void of not having the game, but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for a more substantial game.

Breaks within the first few games

  Do we bought this for christmas for our 2 1/2 year old son with the idea that it will sit in the closet for a few months until he is ready to play. Well he opened it and wanted to play so badly so we thought ""what the heck"" and showed him how to do it. To our surpise he was actually really good at the game and understand the concept. He loves to count the marbles and count ours to see who wins. With that being said we enjoyed playing with him and that all 3 of us could play together. Unfortunately with our multiple games played that day our blue hippo broke that my husband had. Alright well we have 3 hippos and that's all we need right now......until the next morning *today* he wakes up and asks to play Hippos and so we brought it out and starting playing.....until mine the yellow hippo broke and just like that it is now only a 2 players game.....some awesome Christmas present mom and dad!

  Hungry hungry hippos is a fun game, but its cheap, flimsy plastic, every single one of these hippos gets stuck, the handles are hard to push down. It definitely impedes game play when you're constantly having to fiddle with the handles and necks.

  This toy was the favorite toy of Christmas for our three year old boy.  He played with this thing for hours (literally) and for some reason won every time.  I have no idea how he does this as there is no skill involved - it's just wild slapping as far as I can tell.  If I had one suggestion it would be that there would be more little balls.  Sometimes these things fly everywhere. Eventually we will lose them all.

These Hippos Have Been Hungry For Decades
","

  I bought this after seeing it and being hit by a wave of nostalgia, remembering the fun my sister and I had with this game 30 years ago. I wanted my kids to have an opportunity to create a similar fun memory.Back in the 80s/90s, from what I can recall, the game was one unit plus the balls. I dont recall any storage option for the balls, but it's possible that of there was one, it was just destroyed by older siblings before getting passed down to us. Now, each hippo detaches and can reclip to the bottom of the main game square for storage. The balls also have a storage lid that screws to the bottom of the unit. Frankly, as someone who had to problem solve backup options for lost game pieces multiple times, I rather like the change in storage.Oh...and yes...my kids love it!

Classic game; terrible box design.
","

  Classic game. Is basically impossible to put back in the box. I mean, you can, but it's a pain. You have to remove the hippos, arrange them in a pattern underneath the board, lock their necks in place, and place the marbles in shallow cup that loosely attaches. If you don't get it just right it won't fit in the box and the marbles may fall out. The marbles falling out wouldn't be such a big problem except that the box comes with a cutout where the hippo's mouth is on front of the box. Terrible design, especially if you want the kids to put away the toys themselves. The game itself is a classic and fun.

  I had this game as a kid and couldn’t wait to play this with it three year old. I had no idea it required some assembly and once it’s put together it cannot fit back in the box unless it’s pulled apart again, which is annoying. Also, if you’re playing with just two players, the balls get stuck in the center of the game. The center has a kind of dip where the balls naturally roll to. I don’t think it’s as durable as when I was a kid. But it’s still a fun game, I just have issues with the design and quality.

  The game itself is a classic and the kids love playing, but this is cheaply made. It wobbles so you are constantly trying to adjust it. Plastic marble? really? As others have said, they constantly get caught in the hippo. We've already had problems with the hippos themselves and have to stop the game to readjust. It wouldn't hurt if the playing surface wasn't so small that you could actually sit at the kitchen table and play instead of on the floor.

Don't make them like they used to

  Fun game. Kids have loved it, the hippos are already failing after playing it 3 times. The ""reset block"" on one of the hippos has deformed making it very hard to have it function normally. This is due to the cheap mfg process of the game (pretty much all games do this now). We also had one hippo that was borderline defective out of the box, this is the one I use because you have to really give it pressure for it to reset as well. Fun game though, just not going to last very long.

  I absolutely dread when my grand children want to play with this game. It is so difficult to work with, put together, and take apart for storage. Two of the Hippos barely worked right when we got it. The marble store on the bottom and the Hippos do too, and they often get stuck. One of the clip things to snap them into place broke on one of the Hippos the first day. I can't wait until they forget about this game and I can throw it out. My grandson asked for it for Christmas, that is the only reason it is still here.

  Who doesn't love this game?  However, in an effort to make it easier to store (and lets be honest, cheaper to make), the hippos sometimes get jammed as they're meant to unclip and be stored underneath the rectangular game piece.  It works best if played on a smooth, hard surface, but harder on carpet.

  You have to disassemble and reassemble the hippos onto the board every time you play but breaking off the plastic attachment clips or clamping it back on. Unless you want to keep it all together but they fall off all the time anyway and it's hard to store since it doesn't fit back into the box fully assembled. No storage for the balls, which are small and definitely a choking hazard.The game itself is just pretty cheaply made, my memory of this game is that it's supposed to stay together and not fall apart when you pick it up.

  Terrible/cheap product design.  Game base does not sit flat on a table (marble compartment underneath sticks out, and makes the entire unit wobble).  Should also come with anti-skid rubber pieces, which I will be adding myself.  The hippo heads/necks lock up very frequently and gameplay is very frustrating, especially to small children.  The only way to get the game back into the box is by removing the hippo pieces, which will inevitably breaks the plastic tabs used to hold the hippos to the game board.

  If you know the game from your childhood, obviously none of the mechanics have changed and it's just as fun to play now as it was then. My disappointment comes from where it seems everyone is a little disappointed: build quality. It'll definitely withstand light use, but I certainly don't remember it being such a low quality product all these years. The plastic is sharp and not easy to assemble for kids. Even for adults it's not the most intuitive design and is already showing signs that it won't last very long.

  This was an extremely cheap version compared to the older game. The game does not come assembled so once you put the hippos in place, the game no longer fits in the box and it's not very easy to snap them on and off, especially for children. This means my 5 year old wants to toss the entire thing in the toy box, losing all of the pieces.This would be so much nicer if the box actually fit the game.

  Got this for my grandsons to play with at my house because I had fond memories of this game.  They are 2 and 4.  While assembling this, which was not as easy as indicted on the instructions, two of the hippos almost broke while trying to get their heads unlocked.  This is so poorly and cheaply made that it barely lasted the first time we played it.  It is lopsided - and yes I assembled correctly, and the hippos barely stood up to a little two year old trying to play with it.  Am going to ask for my money back.

Very fun game, but poor quality
","

  Overall, this game was worth the buy. It is very cheaply made though, but it was cheap anyways so I don't feel like I lost any money on it. The main problem with it is that the ""Hippo"" sections don't fit well in their spots. It's made with a great design that comes a part easily and stores in a fun way. It even has a container that snaps on the bottom to keep the balls in. It would be much too hard for a small child (maybe even an 11 or 12 year old) to put together and put away.I even had trouble the first time putting it together.Snapping the hippos into place to play the game was very difficult, maybe it'll fit better with use, but I'm not sure.Also, when playing the game, the balls often get jammed in the hippos' throats and then instead of ""eating"" more balls, every time you lift up the mouth balls will come back out! It kind of adds a fun twist to the game, but gets annoying when trying to set-up again since you have to shake it to make the balls come out all the way.I gave it three stars because I wasn't expecting an AMAZING quality board game anyways. It was really ""Ehh"" but it is still a blast to play as long as you don't get mad when trying to put it together for the first time.

Lesser quality than the original
","

  I'll start this off by saying my two daughters (currently ages 2 and 4) love this game. The fun factor is the same as it ever was - for the most part. There are a few quality factors that affect the game's playability.- The ""marbles"" are now cheap plastic and don't give the same satisfying ""thunk"" the marbles gave from the version I grew up with. These light weight marbles are also prone to getting caught in the hippo's throat. Unfortunately, you need to take off the hippo to remove the offending marble.- Doesn't fit back into the box unless you want to take it apart and put it back together every time you use it (the hippos are detachable). This is a no go if your young children want to play the game on their own- Our version doesn't have a flat base, so it wobbles.- The hippos mouths sometimes get stuckI would have returned this if our daughters didn't love it so much. But honestly, after reading the reviews prior to purchase, I more or less expected the quality I received. I hate buying items that are poor quality, but my daughters have fun with it, and in the end, that is what matters.

  It has been a few decades since I played Hungry Hippos last, but this version is a very close representation to what I remember.  The build quality is pretty good and I like how this version breaks down and stores easily back into the box.  The only thing I took a star off for was the ""marbles"" were more like plastic spheres vs real marbles.  This could be due to cost or safety, but it changes the play dynamics from my memory of the old days.

  This is the worst quality game we've ever purchased. The first time we played it the mechanisms on the hippos broke which rendered it useless as they get stuck. We contacted Hasbro and told them the problem and they were very nice and sent out a replacement, which made me happy. Upon opening and proceeding to play with it the first time, the mechanisms did the same thing and got stuck. Both products were from India and they must have a quality issue there. They just don't make things like they used to.

  My first order the item was defective. Two of the hippos lever kept getting stuck due to a defect. You can see where the lever dips in. A replacement was sent thereafter. I saw two differences in slight color variation of the whole complete set and the workmanship. The defective one was made in India. And the replacement one was made in China. The China one was much better. The colors and levers all worked much better. So if you ordered yours and the hippos keep getting stuck, replace it and hopefully they ship you the one made in China.
