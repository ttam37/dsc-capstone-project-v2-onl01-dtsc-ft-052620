0,B076HK9H7Z,R1OSPWS88F2CUZ,DO NOT BUY!!!,"  I would give this zero stars if I could! If you‚Äôre into the original sorry game, DON‚ÄôT buy this version. They changed the rules entirely while ruining the whole game! There are no longer 4 pawns per person, they only have 3! And rather than only being able to get out on a 1 or 2, you can now get out on any number.. oh and the ‚Äúsorry!‚Äù card which allows you to bump someone back to start, now also has the option to move 4 places. It‚Äôs like this game was created for this new generation of entitled children that can‚Äôt take the time to finish a challenging game the right way without throwing a fit because they have instant gratification issues. Wish I opened it sooner so I could return it. I am very diasspointed in this update!!",1.0
1,B076HK9H7Z,R1DCFJ8VYSN17B,Is this the millennial version?,"  This is not the original sorry game. It only has 3 pawns per team instead of the traditional 4. The rules are different also. These rules state that you can exit your home zone with any forward moving card..which is everything except for 4?!?! They ruined the game! This is like the millennial version, do everything to make it easier for the players to make it a quick game. Very sad. Look for the original!",1.0
2,B076HK9H7Z,R1V07N4GXA7RSL,Wimp and Crybaby Edition,"  We bought this to replace our old Sorry game that was falling apart.  I wish we had read the reviews first instead of assuming it was still the classic Sorry--it is definitely not.Differences:- Game board design (doesn't look as good, but it doesn't interfere with play)- 3 pawns instead of 4- Sorry cards can be used to move you forward 4 spaces- Can leave Start on ANY forward-moving card- The 2 card doesn't have you draw againHonestly, if I had known those things, I would NOT have bought this game.  One reviewer called it the Millennial version, and I'm going to agree.  The original game was an excellent tool for teaching kids to suck it up if things didn't go the way they wanted.  Everyone else's pawns are out and yours are still in Start because you haven't drawn a 1 or 2?  Too bad!  Your opponent drew a Sorry card and sent you home?  Deal with it!  This new version is for wimps and crybabies.And why only 3 pawns?  Cutting costs, most likely.Hasbro, you've mucked up a great game.  I'll be looking for the real version and donating this one (though I might put a warning on the box).",1.0
3,B076HK9H7Z,R2Z262NZDEU2EY,NOT the original/regular Sorry!,"  Be warned that this is not the sorry you grew up with. This has only three tokens per player, and the rules are different and make it much easier and in my opinion not as fun. I think this version is good for kids ages 4-8ish. My kids are a little older so we returned this and got the original version, which we all love. I don't think the description on this one is clear enough, so we didn't know we weren't getting the normal Sorry that's been around for decades.",2.0
4,B076HK9H7Z,RG3XIFV1PUX9Y,"Not the classic by a long shot, but okay.","  Definitely not the classic game, with only 3 pawns each and cards instead of dice, but this version did go significantly faster than I recall from my childhood. I bought this along with some other games for our biweekly game nights and was pretty disappointed when I opened the box. But it turned out pretty okay. It will be easier to play with younger kids (or adults like my husband) with short attention spans.",4.0
5,B076HK9H7Z,R2H041QAA230ZV,Buyer beware! Not the traditional game!,"  I love classic Sorry and bought this as a replacement for a worn out set. I didn't read the description well enough so it's my fault, but we are very disappointed. This only has 3 pawns for each color and the cards aren't all the same.",3.0
6,B076HK9H7Z,R270ZSYIA1A6TC,This is an excellent set in a sturdy box with good cards,"  This is an excellent set in a sturdy box with good cards, pawns, and gameboard in it for playing a new version of Sorry, not the classic version. For the price and what you get, it's worth it. I knew, though, what I was buying when I bought this game set...that's why I only gave it a 4. I bought it to get the colored cards that were in this set because that's what my daughter wanted for her kids and no other set had them. I put the colored cards in the classic Sorry game set I'm giving my grandson for his birthday. I knew when I bought it that there were only three pawns of each color...I'm giving the pawns to her to use as spares (you know how little things get lost when you have kids! LOL!). I'm not a fan of the tri-fold gameboard, but this gameboard did lie flat without a gap, even though it was thinner that other Sorry gameboards. The pawns are sturdy and in opaque bright colors and the game cards were a trifle thinner than other Sorry game cards but sturdy enough for the usual playing of the game. All in all, if you realize that what you are getting is a new version of Sorry, not the classic version, you will be happy with the quality of the product. I am happy with the quality of the product.",4.0

8,B076HK9H7Z,RMDX45RE851CV,Save your money!,"  I think Amazon needs to offer a minus star category! Hasbro missed the mark by a country mile on this game. Could the game experts at Hasbro please tell me the reasons behind changing the game so completely from the original version? This version is so bad that we used a fine Sharpie and corrected the cards to read what they were in the original. If you are thinking of buying this game, DON'T! Instead come up with an additional $6 and buy the retro version.",1.0
9,B076HK9H7Z,RKHWNKOK55CXC,Not the original game. Rules bent to let everyone feel good. So sad.,"  This new version is what‚Äôs SORRY. they changed all the rules and everyone gets to go everyone. No more actual competition in this game of chance. So sad,so sorry. I want the original game back. This is just as bent and twisted like all the New Democratic rules to let everyone feel like they ‚Äòwon‚Äô where‚Äôs the competition??? I‚Äôm surprised this version didn‚Äôt come with a participation trophy for everyone as well.",1.0

11,B076HK9H7Z,R3P12ZPE1K83WM,This is a great step before we move onto tougher games,  Haven't played this since I was a kid.  Now my 6 year old MAKES me play! hehe.  She learned basic moving with 'Chutes and Ladders' so I moved up to this.  She's learning how to juggle three pawns and learning strategy.  This is a great step before we move onto tougher games.,4.0
12,B076HK9H7Z,R2UIHS3AUR8Y4S,Not the same Sorry I grew up with.,"  This is not the original Sorry I grew up with. They made it way too easy, by changing a few rules (you can move out of start with any forward-moving number card, instead of having to draw a 1 or 2) and decreasing the amount of pieces to move per player to 3. After playing the old one with my young kids, this one was a major let down. If you can, track down the older version. Skip this one.",1.0
13,B076HK9H7Z,R3VTSCGM76CY5V,NOT the original SORRY!,"  This is NOT like the original SORRY! game.  I would NOT purchase if you‚Äôre looking for the original.  This game only has 3 pawns per color, the rules are different (you can leave start on any number..) it‚Äôs just a cheap version and nothing indicates that it would be this way. Spend the extra $$ and buy the real game.",1.0
14,B076HK9H7Z,R21L3BK3B5LXO1,"Dumbed down version, unclear description","  Im an frustrated. I bought this game, for $5, thinking its a good cheap game. Who doesnt love sorry?! But it is the dumbed down version of this game. Only 3 pawns each, and rules and cards are different. I would not have purchased this version had i known. I even read the description which stated 4 pawns. I havent decided if i will return it yet. But this is super disappointing.",2.0
15,B076HK9H7Z,RDAT6TBRS7IPO,Does not include fire and ice rules :-/,  We ordered this during the holiday sale because our friends had it and we absolutely loved playing it. The deal seemed like a steal too. We finally got round to opening it this week to play and it has no fire and ice tokens or cards! It is the super old version which is super boring!! I wish they would have listed that somewhere. It was a total waste of money as it is quite boring without those 2 tokens. Be warned that it does NOT include those so the cards also dont have any taking all the fun away!Now figuring out how to return :-/,1.0
16,B076HK9H7Z,R3HUP4TZVNPVM,The older version is much better.,  There are a bunch of rule changes and only has 3 pieces per color.  The older version is much better.,1.0
17,B076HK9H7Z,R35Z72VNIIJ41I,Thank you Liz!üòé,"  I got this as a BD gift for my daughter in law during the shelter in place order. I wanted something my granddaughter could also play with the family. No gift wrapping or note, but hey, Amazon is hard hit to get us our orders. A big thank you to Liz for the included note. Wishing you, your family and co-workers best of luck as we ride this pandemic wave. Be safe, keep washing your hands and donning a mask!",5.0
18,B076HK9H7Z,RP1BXXQO1KSGX,The ultimate in corporate greed and cheapness...,"  My kids, my grand-kids and I have been playing Sorry for years. I just wanted to get an extra set for my house so the kids didn't have to bring it with when they visit. I was pretty appalled when I found that they knocked the number of plastic pawns down from 4 to three. Wow!!! This must have saved them 1/10 of a penny on every game. Where is the corporate greed going next, or going to end (not likely).",3.0
19,B076HK9H7Z,R2VX1ZQJTVEES0,No pawn pieces,"  I am giving a 3 star only because the seller sent me out a second game without any problems.  But my problem is that I contacted the seller the first time because the game didn't have any playing pieces.  They so kindly sent out a new game immediately. I never opened it until last night 2 month later, just to discover that this game also has no pieces.  So now I have two of these games without any pieces to move around the board.  Im really stumped on how this is even possible.  All we did at the table while getting ready to play this game was laugh at the issue.  gotta laugh. lol",3.0
20,B076HK9H7Z,RQSFZLY2WUEA6,Both Sorry! games missing essential parts,"  My children have enjoyed Sorry! and were due for a new one to replace the one left behind during our vacation. Both the first set Amazon sent and also the replacement set were missing the individual movers, the tokens which are essential to playing the game.",1.0
21,B076HK9H7Z,R2U7G7SS2U6D2L,Impressive game for entry level gamers (AND not only for them!),"  This has been our introduction to games for our son and it capture the entire family. Right number of rules, easy to understand and remember (they are written on the card). Up to 4 players, but also great if you play in two players. quality of the material is good, even if we are playing on this frequently, the cards and the board are still in good shape. It's not only for kids, believe me: I have tried to find some strategies that works well to win the game, so it's for all level of players.",5.0
22,B076HK9H7Z,R30N60HQRR3T2I,Dumbed-down,"  If you are familiar at all with the older version of this game, and loved it like our family did, you may not care for this newer version as much.  The older version provided 4 pawns per person, and the play cards used to have more cards with specific direction, rather than just moving the amount of spaces shown on the card.  This new version offers only 3 pawns per player, and as mentioned before, most of the cards only instruct you to move forward.  This version is boring, and less entertaining, it moves too quickly, and overall, is a disappointment.  I still like to concept of the game, but I would recommend that if you can find an older version, to get that one.",2.0
23,B076HK9H7Z,R1271WBRQ7UI97,Not original game,"  I ordered the Sorry game (family favorite) as a gift for grandson.  I did not realize (my fault) that the game is different from  the original.  It has 3 markers per person vs. 4 and rules have changed to make game easier.  It seems more like a Sorry game for juniors now.  Very disappointed.  Would NOT buy again.  I normally check reviews, but did not consider that game would have changed so ‚Äúknew‚Äù I would like it.  Stupid mistake on my part.",1.0
24,B076HK9H7Z,RLFVRHWOURS88,"Great game, but...","  My children & I have always just loved this game.  I bought it for my son about 12 years & we'd been using the same board, etc all this time.  I decided that we should get a new one to replace the board that was falling apart.  Lo & behold, the new game arrived & needless to say, we were disappointed.  Such poor quality.  Just really flimsy.  Plus, instead of 4 pieces, there are only 3 that you have to get to ""Home"".  It's been dumbed down!We still play it as it's just a fun game, but the kids prefer to use the old board.",3.0
25,B076HK9H7Z,R3Q510EK55ZK17,Wimpy version,"  This felt like the sissy version of Sorry! I played as a kid. You have three pawns instead of four, so you already have less of a challenge. Then the cards changed to make the game easier. You used to have to wait for a one or two to get your pawn out of start. Now, almost any card gets your pawns on the board. It's a lot less challenging, and a lot less ruthless. There really isn't much opportunity for ""revenge"" because the game is too easy. I was incredibly disappointed when I played. So much so, I want to buy a better version and turn this one into a drinking game or give it away.",4.0
26,B076HK9H7Z,R1X59M1CVIDBFU,Wish I‚Äôd read reviews,  I really wish I‚Äôd thought to read reviews before buying this game. It should mention that it‚Äôs changed the whole game up. I will be buying the classic game now because I never dreamed Sorry needed to be revamped for no apparent reason.,2.0
27,B076HK9H7Z,RL6JX06L9UP4S,Not original Game!,"  When I ordered the game, I thought it was the original. I was confused because I didn't realize that there was a different version created in 2013. This version has only 3 pawns and you do not need a two or one to start the game. I was disappointed at first but decided to keep the game because I feel it would be good for younger ages such as preschoolers. I did order the original though to play with my six year old.",5.0
28,B076HK9H7Z,R3E0Z0XATXW2G6,Pacheesi with a twist,"  This is a delightful game, relatively simple for younger players, maybe 6 and up, especially if you're willing to help them the first couple of games and point out what they can take advantage of.  But it's still fun for adults too:  Pacheesi with a few twists like getting to go backwards sometimes.  I love board games and I wish I had more people to play with.",5.0
29,B076HK9H7Z,RKC5OJGGAHVOP,Not the real game! Stripped down nonsense!,"  TLDR version; if you can get an extra pawn of each color, this version is playable as the classic version. Long version: This is NOT the classic game of Sorry; it is a stripped down children's version, and the packaging fails to show it. It is now only 3 pawns instead of 4, you can leave Home on any movement card (instead of 1 or 2) and the Sorry! card allows you to move 4 as an option to swapping places with another player. We fortunately had an extra set of 4-each pawns from a discarded copy of the game.  There is still the original count of 45 cards; you can just play with classic rules for the cards. Honestly, the components are good quality. If you buy this version, at least round up an extra pawn for each color, and it can be played OK. (Or don't buy it at all!)",2.0
30,B08GD242TJ,R1H2W27UTJSNM1,Great for kids and adults!,"  This is a classic! My in laws were just in town and they and my daughter played this for hours multiple days, definitely a game enjoyed by all ages!",5.0
31,B08GD242TJ,R3RJX70AQ7C3CB,"Great artwork, came undamaged and with all the pieces","  Awesome!! The game came undamaged, had every thing inside, and the artwork is amazing! I love how instead of the older version, this one has a lot of female characters and bipoc characters.  The game was awesome and it will definitely be one of my top favorite games!",5.0
32,B08GD242TJ,RWID92ENM9ZNW,Great game,  My family loves this game. The parts stick a little but not in a way that hinders play.,4.0
33,B00C0ULS3G,R2D825M8DG50P2,Million dollar company-- fix your cases!!!!,"  My son has been asking for this game so I got it for him for his birthday. I debated getting the electronic one but after reading reviews decided not to.I used to love this game as a kid. But we all know that they just don't make anything the way they used to.The game itself is fun. But the actual product is terrible! The cases are so cheap and feel like they're going to break. And the worst thing-- they are NOT big enough. If you put all the pegs where they are supposed to go to store, it won't close. You have to take some out and put them somewhere else, or like we do, just put them in the middle of the case. Are you kidding me? You couldn't spend the extra pennies to make it big enough? And even when you can close it, they never seem to close all the way. Which means I can't even throw away the box and just store the cases, unless you put them in a Ziploc bag or something. Otherwise, I am sure you will lose the pieces or have a mess after they open and spill. So disappointing!",3.0
34,B00C0ULS3G,R1KI7HLOH6V6YE,Lots of design flaws,"  I definitely don't recommend buying this game. My grandkids play it at their house, so I bought one for mine. I didn't read the reviews since I knew they liked playing the game - big mistake. Hasbro must really be cutting corners cost-wise. The bins for the pegs are skimpy, making it easy for pegs to fall out, and the case doesn't close fully when all of the pegs are in the bins. I'm keeping the white pegs in plastic zip-locks and dividing the red ones between the red and white bins. All of the pegs come in one plastic bag, and the instructions say to divide each color evenly between the 2 cases. Seems like they could easily have put half of each color in a separate bag. BTW, handling the small pegs is not meant for people with arthritis in their hands. The ships are meant to be stored in another side section, but it's difficult to get them in place and they easily fall out of their ""berths."" As others have said, it's difficult to see the letters and numbers identifying the rows and columns of the grid - a contrasting color to the background would have been great. If I had it to do over, I'd teach the grandkids to play the game with paper and pencil - easier, more fun (more ships, easily identified by the first letter of their names), and of course much less expensive.",1.0
35,B00C0ULS3G,R34OHIV8ZH6KR1,Yet another fine example of style being favored over utility.,"  The ""new"" design of this classic game is terrible.  When all of the pieces are counted out and placed in their respective reservoirs the plastic top barely clasps down (see photos). What was wrong with the classic design hasbro? Some genius marketing whiz at HQ think battleship needed a facelift? The left side of the board has neat little spots to place the ships. This is a moot point however because if you move the unit at all they fall right out of their designated places, which begs the question: why bother? Obviously the game plays just fine but I cant reccommend this poorly designed version.",2.0
36,B00C0ULS3G,R3JNZO8SXLZ5AH,Like I remember!,"  Was worried about buying this based on other reviews, but went ahead and went for it since my 6 1/2 year old son loves the travel version so much (which is terrible because you can't mark which spots on your ships have been hit).  Honestly, although maybe a touch smaller than the old 1980's version, it's very similar.  We haven't had issues with pegs falling out.  The ships can pop out of place if you knock into the board, but if you keep it on the floor or a table, no worries.  My son is already enjoying having a much better way to play this game!",4.0
37,B00C0ULS3G,R3FZ0D2XSQWIIJ,Letters and Numbers extremely hard to read,"  I am thoroughly disappointed with this ""new"" version of the classic Battleship game.  Each player's ""board"" includes the standard pieces -- ships and pegs. But the left hand column of letters and top row of numbers are very hard to distinguish from their background.  The numbers / letters are imprinted into the the plastic material, so it is difficult to play the game without light aimed directly at each board.  The 2 boards are cheap and flimsy; the top vertical piece in one of the boards seems to repeatedly slip out of place.",1.0
38,B00C0ULS3G,R1OTWXBHXAH22Y,It's battleship.,"  Well it's battleship. Its not electronic so there's not much to go wrong with it. The pegs didn't seem loose to me like I'd seen in other reviews. Two big improvements I can see is #1 the peg storage. The compartments that house the pegs just aren't quite big enough. I ended up putting the white pegs where the ships would go which isn't a big deal. #2 the letters and numbers on the upper and lower grid are incredibly hard to see. I fixed that with a strip of masking tape and wrote them on it in permanent marker. These adjustments took only a few minutes. In the end, it's a fun game. The pegs are sturdy and there are certainly plenty of them and they store inside the case along with the ships. We actually just finished playing a few rounds with the kids and when we were finished it was as simple as shutting the cases and putting them in the box. When you first get the game and open it, you will find inside the box the two cases, instructions for playing the game, a sticker sheet that has two ""Battleship"" stickers to put on the cases, a plastic grid that has the total of 10 ships (5 for each player) that you simply twist to take apart from the grid and a bag that contains all of the red and white pegs. You will need to split the pegs evenly between the two cases. After these initial steps you're ready to just open the cases to play and shut them to put them away. I gave this 4 stars just because of the minor adjustments, otherwise it's a great game.",4.0
39,B00C0ULS3G,R3DLCLD4P6YCBM,Pretty flimsy with bad pegs,"  Battleship is a fun game for anyone of any age.I loved playing this game with my Dad and cousins, when I was growing up.I bought this for my son, because sadly I didn't keep my old set.This is not as sturdy as the sets sold in the 1980s.And I feel like they are smaller too.If you keep your board still, on a table, then the pegs are fine.But if you put it on your lap on a sofa or comfy chair,and tilt it AT ALL, in any way, the pegs will fall right out.The problem with that?  Now you might have to start all over with your guesses.The pegs don't always want to stay in the ships either.The price is right, but the boards are too cheap and flimsy, the pegsare terrible.",3.0
40,B00C0ULS3G,RKDFBEQYJPZ4V,How to always win at Battleship:,"  No matter what coordinates your opponent calls, say ""miss.""  Then put a white peg in that hole in your bottom board.  This way, you can move your ships wherever you want until they won't fit anywhere else.  The only way you can lose with this strategy is if your opponent is doing the same thing.  So if it gets down to the end and your ships are cornered and can no longer move, clean up all the white pegs from your bottom board and quickly accuse your opponent of cheating.Boom!  Guess who's not doing the dishes tonight?",4.0
41,B00C0ULS3G,R1Q3E330UWY95E,"Great game, but VERY flimsy!","  It's a great classic game and I got it today. But the toy quality is extremely horrible. It's very flimsy. Hasbro, are you kidding me? Can't you make this awesome game with better quality? Is this best you can do? I paid $11.92, but this game should cost less than $5. My 6 yrs old son loves this game, otherwise I'd return it immediately. Many other customers have complained about the bad quality, too. Sorry, I cannot recommend it to others. I will NOT buy it again.Pros:1. Great fun game2. Portable battle cases are convenient. This is it. No more pros.Cons:1. Very flimsy and weak. Feels like it will break easily.2. Letters and numbers are very hard to see! They should be labeled with different bold colors3. Pegs and ships don't stick well4. Plastic grid charts don't stay well5. Cheap quality6. Not kids friendly looking game. Looks dull and boring",2.0
42,B00C0ULS3G,R2TMQRYNJYQWVJ,SO LOW QUALITY,"  Same  Great game from when we wer kids but the quality is SO CHEAP now.  Flimsy plastic; the vertical grid and pegs keep falling out.  Try to look for the original from an antique store, I guess.",2.0
43,B00C0ULS3G,R3AYY98LU90RQR,Very easy to use and travel-friendly,"  I bought this game and love that it comes in a pair, which is perfect for my twins! Given that we are holed up at home due to Coronavirus, this has become my favorite game to play with them. It is so easy to use and understand. Some negative reviews are correct in that the ships fall out of place and there isn't enough space inside for the while and black pieces, but we have had no issues so far, and if I had not read those reviews I wouldn't have thought it was such a big deal. The ships and pieces are fine for little fingers, and I have a harder time with it than my kids. The game is perfect for 6-7 year olds, and I enjoy playing it myself. It is also a good game to play virtually with friends.",4.0
44,B00C0ULS3G,R3SC0Q3FANCDAV,"Couple problems, couple solutions","  I've never won a single game and I continue to play, that should tell you how much I enjoy this game. I had a set when I was a kid and purchased this because it came with the individual battle packs like the old ones and who doesn't love a little nostalgia? The packs aren't exactly perfect, but I did have the high expectations. Below I listed my top complaints and simple ways to fix them so I have nothing to complain about:PROBLEMS:1. The packs have holes in the bottom so your cheater opponent can see where your ships are from the shadows2. The pack hinges are loose so it will stay up, but if you bump it say goodbye to all your naval intelligence for that round (pegs fall right out)3. The coordinate labels are the same color as the rest of the board and that makes it very hard to readSOLUTIONS1. Set your pack down, do not hold it in the air2. Sit a considerable distance away from your opponent so you do not feel the need to shield your board and risk dislodging your progress3. Play with ample table or natural lighting",4.0
45,B00C0ULS3G,R2CVQNTK4JVIYY,good strategy game,"  The game itself is good for learning strategy and patience. But in this version, the letters and numbers are simply raised plastic. unreadable to both a 5 year old and 45 year old. We had to make strips of tape with the coordinates on them so we could play. Since the game comes with a few decals, it would be nice if they had decals for this. Also, the lids cannot be closed on a game in progress, the ships are supposed to be stored by lining them all up in specific spaces, and the bins for the pegs aren't actually big enough to hold all the pegs (they would be if the ships could just be tossed in a bin instead of lined up). seems like basic package design flaws that could have been addressed in a game that hasn't changed in 40 years.",3.0
46,B00C0ULS3G,RZDSN46YYW1VZ,New favorite game,"  I purchased battleship for my 7 year old daughter.This was one of my favorite games growing up playing with my mom and brother, and had to bring it into our collection now that my daughter is getting older.Its definitely a newer version with the same concept, and I dont think improved.The pins and ships are always popping out if youre not careful on the bottom of the board. It is not sealed off which is a bummer. It always seems they never give enough white pins. However my 7 year old is obsessed and loves it.Its a great game for learning tactics, and graphs in a fun competitive way.,",5.0
47,B00C0ULS3G,R2CO5M0K8IYBBT,A classic and a winner,"  I am a middle school teacher and bought this for school to be played during an end-of-the-day activity period. As expected, it's a hit. The newer design isn't flimsy like I feel some newer games have become-- there's a little initial setup (punching out plastic boats and dividing up the pegs between 2 boards), but after that, it's smooth sailing (pun intended). It's a great game for a variety of ages, easy to catch on, fun to play, and keeps kids occupied a while. I am as much a fan as I was when I played as a kid!",5.0

Trying to teach my 7 year old, we had to pull a book light and the phone flash light over to see them. Not cool. I am giving this 3 stars because it‚Äôs a classic game that I loved as a kid- but the current cheapened version needs work!",3.0
49,B00C0ULS3G,R110MEYRZGQYLL,Classic game but smaller format,"  This is a family favorite.  The product is well made.  They seem to have shrunk the case from the original.  I am all for saving plastic, but it would be great it there was a larger gap On the edges.  It has shrunk so it is easy the other to see the map in front of you.  So we flipped out boats to the top; however, even my petite 9 year old daughter can see the top row on my side.  We were able to make work, but a bit larger game board would make easier not mistakenly cheat while shifting in your chair.",3.0
50,B00C0ULS3G,R2LQ7EFSWLFOF0,Classic game that's fun for all ages,"  What's fun about this game is that no one has an advantage, so it's fun for adults to play with kids because the adult doesn't have to ""let"" the kid win - you've honestly both got the same odds of finding the other player's 5 ships.  This was always one of my favorite games growing up and I still love it - I'll gladly play anytime one of the kids asks me.  I've read many reviews complaining about the pegs falling out of the grids.  My kids and I have played this game dozens of times in the month that we've owned it and we don't have this problem at all.",5.0

If you really like games find a better one. If you have little patience, find a different game. If you only have one kid of battleship playing age think about what you're doing to yourself. If you have multiple kids of battleship playing age know that they will fight, cheat, tattle, lose pegs and never put it away correctly... Perhaps all that is what leads to the fond memories. At the very least, spring for electric battleship.",2.0
52,B00C0ULS3G,R214U1GVCEA03O,Classic game! But where's the storage?,  What a great classic game! The one downfall would have to be the fact that the game pegs have no pouch or place for storage. They come in a non-closable and non re-usable plastic bag so once the bag is opened that's it! We solved this problem by getting some ziploc bags and making it work. The upside? This is great game of strategy and it's a lot of fun!,4.0
53,B00C0ULS3G,R3CQDLPF39NDYU,Pegs and ships are hard to put away,  I like to stack all the white and red pegs for storage and there is a place to put the ships. It is difficult to get the ships in their proper storage locations since the spacing is so tight and it‚Äôs difficult to line up the pegs on the ships to the storage holes.When stacking the pegs for storage its a VERY tight fit.Good luck fitting the pegs in their respective storage spaces without stacking.Otherwise it is decently made.,3.0
54,B00C0ULS3G,R16YJ4J80DHK3E,Cheap,  The game is made cheaper than the one I grew up with. The pegs do not stick in all the and fall out. I would go look at yard sales or thrift shop. I would only buy again if sold under $5,1.0
55,B00C0ULS3G,REONQAGC5RULX,a bit flimsy,  A great classic game!Pro's:--cost is reasonable--plenty of pegs are included in case some are lost.--directions for play are decentCon's:--board quality is poor and feels flimsy.  We had hopped to travel with these but I'm a bit leery now.--Peg boards do not hold the pegs well if you close the board mid game.  Again--just inconsistent quality.Overall its not bad for the price but if you plan to travel with these and play in the car or plane you may want to look for a better quality game set.,3.0

It not only helps to train kid to be patient which they have to to continuously deal with misses but also train their brain how to place theirs ships so they are less likely to be hit. It also teaches them how to reverse thinking about what would most likely the opponent is going to place their ships. Super fun and helps kids leaning!,5.0

Even after playing the game, having the box open for a while, closing it and re-opening it, it still smelled. But we still played as a family. All the pieces and parts of the game were in perfect condition. My children didn't care playing it too much (we played one good game together) because I think they're too into electronics nowadays. But my husband and I enjoyed the game and reminisced who we played with in the past.",4.0
58,B00C0ULS3G,RNYY726S2FGP7,No good,"  Really really cheap. Thin plastic modules that's a really boring color and not big enough to hold all the pegs. Pegs come out very easily. The top has a printed sheet of paper for artwork pinned in place by the top grid (which pops out) but it's just really dull and ugly art. Came with stickers to self-apply and the ships on a sprue, which I certainly would never have expected from a game in 2016 from a major manufacturer. Lots of flashing on the plastic modules, too.Dollar store quality for an asking price maybe 4x higher than it should be for what you get. I should have just gotten the knock off since finding a new copy of reasonable quality can't happen.",1.0

You have to play on a table so you don‚Äôt accidentally move the case since the ships will come out of the holes...Not snug in their positions. Then, of course you can‚Äôt remember where they were. Some of the pegs were broken & fit too loosely on the ‚Äúocean‚Äù section. You can hardly see the letters & numbers on the backboard since they are all the same color as the board.

60,B00C0ULS3G,R2QN24R515OIVA,Hasbro makes cheap junk,"  Battleship has a lot of little pegs. The board is designed with built-in sections that are supposed to hold the pegs. This would be a great idea, except that they didn't make these sections large enough to actually hold all of the pegs, so the pegs are always all over the place. Overall this just feels like Hasbro made this as cheaply as they possibly could. I've played older versions that felt like they were put together a lot better than this and used higher quality materials.Honestly, it's probably good enough, but it'd be nice to be able to pay a few bucks more and get an actual quality product.",1.0

I'm 57-yrs-old with an Ivy League law degree playing with my 16-year-old son and neither of us could figure out how to even play the game, even after reading the instructions over and over to try and make sense of them.

Perfect for a Haunted Mansion fan!,"  I‚Äôm a huge Disney Parks fan, and have been looking forward to the release of a proper Haunted Mansion board game, especially since it was designed by the same company that worked on Villainous. I was initially worried the game would be too simple and not that replayable, but I was wrong! While it‚Äôs still definitely simple, we played four games after opening the box and still wanted to play more!The instructions are very easy to understand, and get you playing quickly. The games aren‚Äôt very long, so it‚Äôs easy to start another game.Because of how simple and easy to learn it is, it‚Äôs a great game to break out for a game night with new players, unlike how Villainous takes a few games in order to get a grasp on the rules.I highly recommend this game!",5.0
65,B08636S37Z,R21JWEU5XQUPWQ,Happy Haunts Materialize!,"  First of all: this game is not complex or hard to learn at all. Really, we learned it in probably 10 minutes just using the manual. All in all, we enjoyed this game and are glad we added it to the collection. I hope Disney continues making new board games for each ride like they have with this one and Jungle Cruise! We‚Äôve loved them. No creepy themes to be found here. Family friendly 100%.Gameplay - By taking 3 actions per turn and doing some simple strategizing, players travel throughout the Haunted Mansion encountering happy haunts and adding ghost cards to their collections. Different ghost cards score different points, and most require collecting the same cards in sets to maximize points. But beware! The hitchhiking ghosts move about the small board each turn, forcing you to draw haunt cards, which can cost you dearly at the end of the game.This game is very easy to learn and set up, and has some fun basic strategy to it that kids will grasp and adults will find entertaining. There is a fair bit of opportunity to directly hamper opponents and even steal their cards, so be prepared for some inevitable conflict depending on your group!Materials - The board is the highlight, featuring great illustrations and a fun rotating ‚Äúendless hallway‚Äù in the center of the board. Plastic figures were good quality, and even the box had fun stretching room illustrations. I felt the cards were a little flimsy and not on par with Villainous or Jungle Cruise however.Final Thoughts - this is a great addition to the collections of Disney fans, those with kids, or anyone looking for a thematic, light, And quick game of what feels like simplified Splendor with some action economy mixed in.",5.0

It's actually a lot like a gin rummy with a board, pesky hitchhiking ghosts, and some fun ways to sabotage your opponent added. In regards to the instructions, YouTube channel Nerdist made a video explaining how to play. I would suggest watching that and THEN reading the instructions all the way through. The video does a great job explaining, but a few details are left out such as the rules for choosing your number in a ""duel"" for example. The game takes about 20-30 mins to play. Once you get the hang of it, you will love it!! I haven't played with a group yet, but can only imagine it would be even more of a blast.",5.0
67,B08636S37Z,RAHCUXX84JAL7,Beware of tricky instructions ghosts,"  This is my new favorite table-top game. I'm not just saying that as a Haunted Mansion fanatic, I'm saying that because my other favorite games are Clue and Guillotine...and this game is very much like both of those games combined. The initial instructions were a bit hard to understand because it explains how the Hitchhiking Ghost movement will affect players without explaining that the Hitchhiking Ghost movement from the INITIAL ""Event"" won't have any effect on any of the players because they aren't on the board yet. This is where we got hung up, but once we realized that ""Events"" are more about setting up each round, we were able to get through it.The instructions themselves beyond that point should be used for reference only at that point. This game is best learned as you go as each card has its own instruction. I feel confident that I can play without reference to the instructions after playing just 2 full games of The Haunted Mansion.The one critique I have besides the instructions being a little confusing (just watch the video they point you to in the instructions), the Ghost cards are a little bigger than I'd like them to be. They completely crowd the two smaller rooms; HOWEVER, I'm pretty sure this is by design in order to give the players a feeling of being crowded by ghosts. So it's not really even a bad critique if that's the case.Otherwise, the game seems relatively sturdy and should hold up as long as you're careful with the character pieces and the paper on the board itself. It's already started peeling up a bit around the center of the board where it folds in half.I'm sure we will get years of fun out of this one.",5.0
68,B08636S37Z,R1FF2Q1AKO6ZL,A must-have for die-hard Haunted Mansion fans!,"  The directions are more complex than a typical board game like, say ... Monopoly, but most modern games have more intricate play and rules now.If you read the directions carefully and walk yourself slowly through sample gameplay along the way (instead of being in a mad rush), it's NOT hard to grasp at all.  There's even a gameplay demo video link that the reviewer with the ""Harvard"" degree didn't notice when reading the instruction booklet.The artwork is really cool, and the ghosts depicted on the Ghost cards are the ones depicted in the Mansion in paintings or Audio-Animatronics (they even have my favorite Sinister 11 portrait: The Witch of Walpurgis!).In this game, the Hitchhiking Ghosts (Phineas, Ezra, and Gus) are the villains.  Cross paths with them, and you have to draw a ""Haunt"" card (each has a point value: 1, 2, or 3).  Rack up too many Haunt points, and you might become the 1000th resident!Anyway, this has become my new top favorite board game in my collection.",5.0
69,B08636S37Z,R2AXCM3PS7V4B8,Love the details,"  Awesome game for anyone, but especially the lovers of Disney and the haunted mansion. It happens to be my favorite ride at the parks so I couldnt wait to buy the game! It does not disappoint.The first go through was a little rough just because we were learning, but that is expected with anything new. We realized we followed one gameplay rule wrong, but hey, it was still fun.Above all though, I love the details they put in the game! As a lover of the ride you can tell they went through a lot of work to make this game. To name a few- the bride is looking for husbands to gain extra points (presumably to kill later, who knows?), the board has a hidden mickey that can also he found in the same spot as the ride (look in the ballroom), and you must keep your hands and feet inside the endless hallway at all times (you wouldn't want to get left behind). Honestly there is a lot of little things to notice in the game and for nerds like me it makes it even better.Overall, buy the game. From a family that plays a lot of them, this is definitely a keeper. And from a disney nerd, it's a great addition to the collection.",5.0

81,B08636S37Z,R1C8WCW3NY553K,Perfect and EASY Set Collection Game for Any Disney Fan!,"  Disclaimer: I am probably the BIGGEST Haunted Mansion fan out there, so I was over the moon when I received this game!First Impressions: It is such an interesting take, and tons of fun. I can see adult Disney fans and gamers playing this on a Friday night over a bottle of wine (like me), and also totally believe the box when it says 9+.The gameplay is simple: You take three actions on your turn (essentially move and collect ghost cards) and you are trying to collect sets of matching cards to get the most points at the end. There are even handy player cards that have the actions spelled out so you never need to reference the rulebook. Speaking of the rulebook, they were smart enough to partner with Geek and Sundry to have an extremely well-done how to play video with the link address right in the directions if you don't feel like reading.Replayability: Tons. Each round is made different by having event cards that change some of the rules for that turn, so although you may have a plan on how to grab the ghost cards you want, there will always be a little twist you'll have to look out for. Also, there are the Hitchhiking Ghosts (with a STUNNING model) that move around the board, and you get penalties if they cross your path. BEWARE THE HITCHHIKING GHOSTS, hahaComponents: Wow. Just wow. The art is INCREDIBLE!!!!!! Every single piece of art is stunningly crafted and each ghost card and the board art is instantly recognizable from the ride. Seriously, look at some of the pics I attached.In summary: This game is a MUST BUY! With the holidays coming up, I know what I will be getting all of my Disney buddies!!!",5.0
82,B08636S37Z,RLX0NDRN1T8IG,"Gorgeous, Simple Game with some severe Mechanical Flaws","  Overview:Haunted Mansion: Call of the Spirits is a simple game of set collecting with a little action management and push your luck. At the beginning each round, an event is flipped that moves the Hitchhiking Ghosts around the board, haunting players, and adding a special effect on that round of play. Then, you place ghost cards on the board, each having different set requirements. Afterwards, each player will use three actions to collect ghosts and manage Haunt cards. Once the end game is reached, players will count up points based on ghost sets and Haunt card penalties.Presentation (Rulebook & Components):The rules are clearly laid out. The game overall is quite simple, so the rules do not have much work to do. But they provide excellent examples, highlight key rules, and just look great overall.As for the components, the overall design and art is great. The illustrations on the ghost cards are incredible and I hope Disney makes an animated Haunted Mansion series. It is really really good. The board also looks amazing and only has one small issue-the crypt room is not very big and you are suppose to place multiple ghost cards in the room. Also, the Hitchhiking Ghost miniatures is wonderful (would have been cool if it glowed in the dark).no captionno captionThere is one big component issue-the Haunt cards. Haunt cards have numbers ranging 1-3 and are used as a penalty and a push your luck mechanic. At the end of the game, whomever has the most Haunt loses the ghost type they have the most of. The issue is the cards a very small and there are 120 of them that need to be shuffled. Not only are they hard to handle, they will wear out the edges quickly. These cards should have been cardboard tokens drawn from a bag, which reduces any need for shuffling and are easier to handle.no captionThematic Implementation:The art really brings the theme of Disney's Haunted Mansion to life. And the way the ghosts are assigned to certain sets works well with the ride. But, the game play really is abstract and the theme largely irrelevant. Nothing really feels like you are in the Haunted Mansion or encountering supernatural events or beings. Some of the unique ghosts score in thematic ways, like the Bride scoring for Groom ghosts. As a light game though, I really did not expect the theme to be very strong.no captionGameplay:The gameplay is a mix bag. It mixes in a lot of different mechanics around set collecting: action management, bluffing, board positioning, and push your luck. Unfortunately, I am not so sure all these mechanics worked as well as one hoped. While the set collecting is pretty straightforward and it is fun collecting different ghosts, how the other mechanics mix in with it kind of fall apart. I will dive into the different issues below.no captionAction Management: Each round you get three actions which can be spent to move, rotate the center of the board (endless hallway), collect a ghost card from your current room, duel another player, and discard a Haunt card. All of the actions are straightforward, but their values vary greatly and at times, you feel like you may not even have a third action really available that has an actual purpose(which is almost always the case round one). Often, the choices are very straightforward so little thought is really put into your actions other than where you need to get to collect the ghosts you need. But, since rotating the board is a single action, movement is not needed often.no captionBluffing (Dueling): There is a mechanic in the game called Dueling where you can try to steal a card from another player by secretly betting Haunt cards (by gaining 0-3 Haunt cards). This is the majority of the direct player interaction. While the mechanic is an interesting concept, in all three of my games, it was only used one time at most each game. It feels like a tacked on mechanic that does not fit the theme nor does it feel worth it based on action options and the Haunt mechanic. You can either use an action to take a ghost guaranteed, or burn actions to get to someone's space and gamble stealing a ghost. Between the gamble and the danger of gaining Haunt, Dueling never feels useful enough to take-on, especially later in the game once more Haunt cards have been dealt out, which I will cover more in the section specifically about the Haunt mechanic.Board Positioning: To collect ghosts, a player must move around the board to different rooms. Also, players can gain Haunts if the Hitchhiking Ghosts move through or land on their space. While it would feel like there should be a lot strategy in board positions, often, it is quite obvious where you need to move. Trying to rotate the board to hurt other players doesn't often come into play, or rather it feels inadvertent because you moved the board to help yourself which just so happens to hurt/help another play. And rotating the board for one action makes movement even more easy. If you are hit by the Hitchhiking Ghosts, it is more random, although it does add some push your luck into the game by taking the chance to sit on the outside board (hallway) longer rather than return back to the center of the board (seance room).no captionPush Your Luck and the Haunt mechanic: One of the core mechanics of the game outside of collecting sets of ghosts is gaining and managing Haunt cards. Haunt cards are numbered 1-3 and can be obtained many ways in the game. At the end of the game, players total the value of all of their Haunt cards and the player with the most Haunt loses all of one type of Ghost that they have most of. Haunts act as a sort of penalty for taking certain actions or gambling on the board. And they can generally only be discarded through collecting one type of Ghost or actually wasting two actions (move+discard) to use the seance room. While Haunt has a good premise, in practice there are some major flaws in the mechanic.First issue is part of how Haunts are distributed. The biggest way to gain Haunts is when the Hitchhiking Ghosts move across a players space or land on it. If it lands on a player, they gain two Haunts instead of one, which is a big penalty and mostly due purely to randomness. You also gain Haunt whenever you collect a ghost in the same space as the Hitchhiking Ghosts, which is a double penalty for whom the hitchhikers land on (making you lose an action to get away from them, or gain additional Haunt). Again, it is generally purely random how the Hitchhiking Ghosts move and land. The randomness removes a lot of strategy and adds some severe penalties for it. You can also gain Haunts through other card effects or Dueling, but that is less often and may not even matter when we get to the other big issue with Haunts.Once a player obviously has more Haunts than the rest the other players (as seen through having one giant stack of Haunt cards), the game makes a dramatic shift for the worst. If a player has an extreme amount of Haunt cards, it is no longer worth their actions or time to discard Haunt cards. Now, there is no need for them to manage Haunt and one big part of the game is removed. Worse, other players now rarely need to manage Haunt because they know they still have less then the person in the lead. Not only does this make the action in discarding Haunt cards almost worthless, Dueling becomes even more pointless when gaining Haunt cards does not mean almost anything to the players involved. But, all the events or ghosts that give out Haunt cards feel less useful when the majority of players are not managing Haunt cards any more. And no one aside from the player in the lead with Haunt cards will be penalized. While Haunting seems like a great mechanic, it really did not feel like it worked as intended. Also, when it feels like a mechanic is being ignored in a game (like Dueling as well), you have to question why it is even there or if it is implemented correctly. While I am not entirely sure I described what is wrong with the Haunt mechanic, something definitely feels off as everyone whom I played the game with agreed.Player Count Differences:While the game can be played with up to six, I only played it up to four. Interestingly enough, player counts 2,3, and 4 all feel different. At two players, collecting ghost sets often felt too easy and managing Haunts seemed silly since once one person had a dramatic lead in Haunts, there was no way to catch back up in reducing Haunts. Thus, the player with less Haunts could essentially not worry about it as a penalty. At three players, there was a bit more back and forth in the fight for ghost sets and managing Haunts. At four players, there were times where there was little options for ghosts on the board, which sort of made turn order matter a lot, and thus add more randomness to the game as far as who gets to go first when certain cards showed up. And once one player had been hit multiple times by the Hitchhiking Ghosts no one was concerned about Haunts except for the player with Madame Leota (who scores 10 extra points if you have the least Haunt at the end of the game). In all player counts, Dueling was largely irrelevant and the Haunt management got odd with players eventually not being all that concerned whether they gained Haunts or not.One thing that is odd that this game does not do (and it is a common problem in a lot of games), the deck distribution does not vary based on player counts. So sometimes certain sets are very easy to get, or sometimes you will rarely see any of certain ghost types.Overall Rating external imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal imageexternal image5/10:The game is quick and light with amazing art and generally overall nice components. The simple set collecting is fun, but very basic overall. Unfortunately, the rest of the mechanics do not mesh as well as I would hope. While it appears to be strategic, luck some times feels overwhelming. Dueling feels like a completely unnecessary and non-thematic mechanic. Haunt management, while an interesting idea, falls short with a bunch of weird situations due to how cards are distributed and how it warps gameplay. Fortunately, being a huge Haunted Mansion fan, I plan on working on some fixes to issues myself and my fellow players found in the game. Keep an eye on these forums for more variants I try out.Thanks for reading my thorough review. If you've played the game, please let me know your thoughts below!",2.0
83,B07B7KS87Q,RFAK7BYOIV5G7,It‚Äôs changed,"  Bought this for my Husband as a Christmas gift. We finally pulled it out to play and it was just terrible. The gameplay has been changed so much and there is really no challenge to the game.  The entire game, between the two of us, we only had 3 cards that required us to pay the bank or another player. The rest of the time playing was spent collecting money every turn.  We even re-read the rules multiple times to be sure we were playing it right.On top of that, the spinner does not spin well at all. We were so disappointed all around with this game.",1.0
84,B07B7KS87Q,R3HR0AV3OU4Q7D,Awful. Save your money.,"  What happened, Hasbro? This game is awful. If I could return it I would. It‚Äôs like Monopoly, but under the guise of life, with green pet pegs. Save your money.",1.0
85,B07B7KS87Q,R3PZJG6TUI8KG0,NOT the Original!,"  I ordered this version of the game thinking it was just like the one I played as a child‚Äîbut with the addition of pets! How wrong I was.Last year I bought Life Jr. to play with my grandkids. I excused some of the features of the game as part of its Junior designation: activity cards often involve singing, acting, or expressing yourself. These are all nice group activities, but they don‚Äôt connect with the activity of playing a board game to me.Tired of Life Jr., I bought the ‚Äúregular‚Äù version only to find that the charades-like activities were part of this game as well. Also, it seemed as though all we accomplished was the exchange of money‚Äîit was constant ... and boring. It‚Äôs just not fun with the changes to how players interact with the game.If you loved the original Game of Life, pay more for the classic version‚Äîyou‚Äôll be disappointed by this one, I can almost promise.",2.0
86,B07B7KS87Q,R32X26QPCZRA2C,It's not the game you remember,"  Games just aren't as good as us 80's kids remember, flimsy pieces and as others have said the spinner doesn't really spin. Also the rules are all over the place. That said, my 9 and 10 year old kids thought it was fun.",3.0
87,B07B7KS87Q,R2E20OX9EFK58W,Completely unrealistic!,"  I admit, I picked it because I needed ""The Game of Life"" for teaching my Sociology class, so I picked the least expensive.  Attempting to play it and utilize it for a lesson on Social Stratification (the various income levels), I was completely flabbergasted by the action card scenarios, currency denominations, and simply the utter lack of reality.Comparing it to an older version of the game, it is an entirely different game.In attempting to be frugal on a teacher's salary, I will now need to purchase/create new versions of currency, careers, homes, etc.  The only usable parts is the spinner & tokens.",1.0
88,B07B7KS87Q,R135TR839U5VXG,What a hunk of garbage  Hasbro should be ashamed for foisting this off on a paying public,"  Having played the original game this is a VERY VERY POOR imitation of that game complete with a cheap wheel that does NOT spin well, tiny pieces and cheap feeling board.  Overall a VERY VERY Big disappointment.  Bought this as a family activity for the children and grandchildren during their recent visit.I understand why the kids bury themselves on their solo electronic devices for this entertainment SUCKS!!HASBRO you should be ashamed of yourself!!",1.0
89,B07B7KS87Q,R1A5ZGCVX9RQHF,Very easy to play and understand,  I bought this because we wanted to play a classic board game with our 12 yr old nephew. He loves animals....so the pet version just made sense. It is way better than the original version!! They simplified the directions so its easy to determine what to do at any given point. The spinner spins easily and smoothly. We had a blast playing and will most likely play it every time he comes over. I highly recommend it!,5.0
90,B07B7KS87Q,R29H0K7FI5J3EF,Good game,  played this with my sister.  Miss the old game as the wheel is hard to turn.  The old game had a hill in it and seemed to have more moves.  This current version starts at college level not at birth like the way I recall.,4.0
91,B07B7KS87Q,R2YDD02EZF2WP5,Perfect family game,"  Another prime deal so I think it was around $8. Great price.My family loves The Game of Life. This one is cute as you can get a dog or cat. The cards and board feel cheaper than the original game we have (early addition with the 3D houses). This one doesn‚Äôt have the 3D houses and the spinner attaches to a corner. That was my one gripe as it kept coming off which was just a bit irritating.The game is a little different than the others, like you don‚Äôt have to buy a house, and stock numbers are including with your career card. There are different paths for starting a family or not.My favorite part is on the action cards there are talking points. Like what type of car would you buy? Or describe your favorite amusement park ride. In a world full of technology and kids lacking the ability to day dream or create original ideas, I love this part. It starts a family dialog.The game was played in about an hour, with interruptions.  Our youngest player was 8.",5.0
92,B07B7KS87Q,RTH8SIB6TCVS7,"Awful, awful, awful!","  Was really looking forward to introducing my 6y/o and 8y/o to Life, which was one of my favorite games growing up. Be advised that this is NOT the version you will remember from the 80s. The spinner quality SUCKS, and there are so many rules to remember that it's not even remotely enjoyable. Tried to play it 1x, and we all lost interest. Donating to Goodwill. Terrible game - save your money and find a vintage Life to purchase.",1.0
93,B07B7KS87Q,R26F52S9WOP61S,Disappointed,"  I miss the older, longer & more fun version. Wish I would've saved my money. That said, if you never played an older version, this one would be perfectly fine. I did not like the shorter version and the elimination of realistic events (house problems, car stolen, etc;). I will keep looking for an older version & get rid of this one asap.",1.0
94,B07B7KS87Q,R2IQSJNHPONID8,disappointed,"  The quality of the game and materials is good. I gave it 3 stars because it is not like the original LIFE game. This version has been seriously 'dumbed down' for younger generations. There are weird cards that award you money for reasons that don't make sense (i.e. You are stranded on an island, collect $30k).  I got through the whole game and never got the chance to buy a house. The addition of pets is unnecessary. I will say the jobs are better than the original and are more relevant. I played with my dad and my 7 year old son. My son loved it but my dad wouldn't stop complaining. I originally bought it to help teach a group of adults on the autism spectrum about budgeting but this version is useless for that purpose. I found a remake of the original and bought that one to use as a teaching tool.",3.0
95,B07B7KS87Q,R14L7CX9EJWDRJ,SO MUCH FUN!,"  This game is so much fun! That is why I gave it two stars instead of one.So why would I give it one star?1) THE SPINNER DOES NOT SPIN!  It is so poorly made, you can't get it to spin hardly at all, and the cardboard behind it with the colors and the red and black keeps sliding around and getting stuck no matter how many times we fix it.  Boo!  This takes away the fun!  Hasbro, get real - I'd rather pay an extra dollar for the game and get a working spinner.  This should be obvious!2) The came only comes with FOUR cars, and not in such great colors.  The Game of Life used to come with SIX cars, so not only could more people play, but even if only a few were playing, you had more colors to choose from.3) WHERE ARE THE BUILDINGS???  And the hill?????  They were so much fun, but Hasbro took them away.  Boo!4) This is subjective, but for ME, I prefer the action cards that *I* land on be for *me*.  I like the old life tiles, where the person who picks it up did something great and gets money, or did something awful and has to pay.  Now you get an action card and you pick someone else and have a spin-off, and sometimes they get paid from my action card.  That's no fun!  I think it's more fun when each person gets their own action cards that relate to them alone.  Like I said, this one is subjective.5) This one is also subjective, but the game was too short.  I think it should have been a little longer.",2.0
96,B07B7KS87Q,R2JEISVP2ST42G,Great update to the original,"  Great update to the original.  The action cards have an extra little activity that you get to do. For example one card you visit the Great Barrier Reef and you have to describe a sea monster that you saw. Another card you show your skate boarding moves. The pets are fun. They did away the 3D pieces that would always pop out and make the board bulky except for the spinner.Cons: Still has the same spinner that rarely work right. Box has a  4"" hole where the spinner sticks out. You have to make sure all pieces are bagged so you don't loose them. The flow of money is ridiculous. I don't expect it to be realistic but maybe not so outrageous. You get paid 30k to go on a ski trip and you have to pay 10k when your pet eats your homework.All and all it is a great family game. We have have 2 boys 9 & 11 and they both had a great time.",5.0
97,B07B7KS87Q,R2NSDEUM8D755W,Pretty terrible but my kid likes it,  This game is awful much like a lot of other reviewers stated. All you do is get money for almost everything you do (even going on a trip).  No real challenges and you have the option of moving through the board pretty fast. The last game I retired with almost $4 million. Gave it three stars because my 7 year old enjoys it.,3.0
98,B07B7KS87Q,R24RN35MQHBILR,"No at all like the original, in quality or execution","  Having not played the game in over 20 years, I was expecting updates. Some of the updates make sense. Jobs and action cards are more reflective of today's environment. But that's where the kudos end. They have found numberous ways to convelut the game. There are too many types of cards, adding confusing spaces on the board. I'm guessing this was an attempt to ""spice things up"". But it falls flat. Also, it's harder for younder kids and newbies to pick up. The biggest, and I mean biggest disappointment however is the spinner wheel. This was the funnest and defining attribute of the original game. In this version the spinner is uber cheap and very difficult to get a good spin. Anyone from the 80's remembers you could spin the wheel and it would go on for a long time. This one falls apart, and is near impossible to get a full spin. Granted the price is cheap, but I'd rather double the price, and get a quality game that could be passed down. Not a thrift store version of the original. Very dissatisfied.",2.0
99,B07B7KS87Q,R30DONS4RTKS5S,TRASH,"  This game is trash. It came to my house sealed and when we finally got through setting it up, we realized it was shipped without any money included. How on earth do you mass produce something as large scale as a board game and forget to include the most important part other than the board itself? The board is also cheaply made with pieces so small even superman couldn't see them. Honestly this game stinks out loud. To make this worse it all happened on Valentine's day. I was going to let my wife win for once and score some brownie points but Hasbro had other plans. Sad.",1.0
100,B07B7KS87Q,R59IOOS4XH5DZ,Ok,"  I remember this game as being fun when I was younger. Now that I am older it is a very intense, pay attention at every turn because something is going to happen with many rules game. It takes awhile to complete the entire game. The spinner sucks but it is what it is for the price. My girls love the game though ... ages 9 and 11",3.0
101,B07B7KS87Q,R3K46LZ4Y85UFW,Not your old game of Life but just as fun,"  Interesting new version of the game of Life. Doesn't play the same as the game of Life I had as a kid but it was just as fun. This is our third game of Life and each play a little different. My daughter loves the addition of pets to the game. Gives it an extra little quirkiness to the game and keeps it interesting. Easy assembly since you don't have to place all of the buildings on before you play. I wish they would add $20,000 dollar bills back to the game again. It gets annoying using so many $10,000 bills for change but that is just a small annoyance. Overall very happy with the game and the new gameplay.",5.0
102,B07B7KS87Q,R2ER9U0DMX04VX,We loved that pets were included.,"  Bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter after she discovered the 1980s version at my house.  Improved alot by: (1) ties salary to job, so it pays to go to college, (2) included pets as well as children (rescuing pets pays!), (3) childcare and college costs per child, but at the end (4) you get some money back for each child and pet (but less for kids?)  Both 6 and now 7 1/2 year olds love it, though I have to be the banker (I make them count the money they get to make it more educational).  Downside, the spinner doesn't work very well.",5.0
103,B07B7KS87Q,R36PHNK0RU9OA6,DO NOT PURCHASE!,"  I was excited to receive this game. I had so much fun playing it as a child. I‚Äôm sure the game is still just as much fun, but do not purchase this version! The spinner, the most important aspect of the game, does not work correctly. Also, the box is split and looks like it has been stored somewhere damp. Just go buy the game from a local retailer!",1.0
104,B07B7KS87Q,R14HHL1QKGZIJK,Fun Quality,"  I was really disappointed in this product, it is not the same game that I played when I was a kid that had the funny endings where you live in a trailer park, go completely broke. Google said game was edited due to some lawsuit by some more dummy who deemed it inappropriate for kids.  So now it's all rainbows, sunshine and eternal happiness. Example: you get $20,000 for dancing all night, rather than brake your leg dancing, pay $20,000 in hospital fees. All of the humor has been removed from game. I would buy the classic version, which is the one that most of us grew up playing.",1.0
105,B07B7KS87Q,RON7X0S8XLN8B,Good but not great game.,"  I loved the concept. There are lots of small pieces so be careful with little children around. Also, that large spinner doesn't sit well on the board, keeps moving which is annoying. Those little cardboard circle pieces that are supposed to be put on that spinner don't stay in place when spinning and fall into the spaces between, so we don't put them on the spinner at all. With all these flaws, the kids like the game, but don't love it.",4.0
106,B07B7KS87Q,R3P6IO85740F4U,The Game of Life....not as I knew it!,"  We bought this for my son for Christmas and he is HOOKED. There are many things I love about it (the addition of pets is awesome) but there are some things that just feel so much more complicated than the Life I knew as a kid. (The spinning for $200,000 and also choosing a number with your career that you have to remember to collect money for when it's spun!)All in all, it's still an awesome game (though we joked that they really needed to upgrade the cars to at least 7 seaters with all the pets and kids you now can get!!!!!!!!!!)",4.0
107,B07B7KS87Q,RIZNSMT33262F,Kids love playing,"  In our house, we like to play family games instead of our kids sitting on electronics all the time. Monopoly wasn‚Äôt the biggest hit, so I figured I‚Äôd try the Game of Life as a fun way to talk about money and the choices we make in life. The game moves so much faster than monopoly, so the kids stayed engaged. It was also more fun for them with the bright cards, the adding marriage and children, or going back to college, etc. This was a big hit in our house.",5.0
108,B07B7KS87Q,RMAMI9RTKAQWP,Stick with the original!,"  What a disappointing gift to give. It is nothing like the original. I had no idea there were different versions. This one is cheaply made, confusing to learn and honestly no one had fun. The spinner doesn't work well at all which adds to the frustration.",1.0
109,B07B7KS87Q,R2IET6X654KM8K,Still fun after all these years.,"  Love this game. Used to play it when I was younger and decided to start playing it again. It's fun, simple and had some changes since back in the day. Now you can add pets to your family, and choose if you'd rather go to college or get a job right away. It's a kids game, but I'm an adult, and I play it with my boyfriend. Granted we make up our own rules lol, but it's still fun to play. The pets and people are made much cheaper and flimsy since back in my day, but what isn't these days?",5.0
110,B07B7KS87Q,R1GWI7NDF391V2,Ugh,  Really wanted something like o remember when I was a kid. The spinner hardly spins. The cardboard piece behind the spinner moves around which becomes a problem for game play. When you spin the spinner it flies off the board. It attempts to be sequred to the edge of the board but that's laughable. The original I played in the 90s was secured to the board and always worked. We are not impressed with the new game play either. Not worth a buy.,2.0
111,B07B7KS87Q,R1MT7OAJL39FTE,"Great quality, quick delivery!","  This is a really good game! We already had this game before, but the only difference was it was the older version without pets, etc. We were going to buy it from Meijer or Walmart, but later decided to get it online, and we DON‚ÄôT regret it. Everything was in tact when the package came to our house. The corners weren‚Äôt chipped on the box of the actuall game, and everything was really crispy inside. The only negative thing I have to say it that it‚Äôs basically like the same as the one we had before, but that‚Äôs not the sellers fault. Other than that, everything was fine!",5.0
112,B07B7KS87Q,R2BX82VDASG5JU,Missing some old features,"  Great price for the game, but it does not have the pop up inserts like the little paved plastic mountains that you set up each time you play the game. It‚Äôs just a flat board. Also the instructions are a little unorganized especially since they have changed the rules a bit since I last played the game as a kid",3.0
113,B00000DMF5,R3ASLABGFJ1ID9,"The ""new improved"" artwork is not for little kids!","  I bought Candyland as my youngest granddaughter is now of the age to play. However, when I looked at the board, I was extremely disappointed!! The snowflake princess looks like a beauty pagant contestant, and then there is the licorice creepy, leering Spaniard (really?) holding a snake!? This board is sending very negative messages to our little ones! Please beware!!!",1.0
114,B00000DMF5,R39194EY04VY6C,Fun Way To Teach Colors,"  I remember Milton-Bradley as the original maker of Candy Land, which it eventually sold to Hasbro. Candy Land is a great way to initiate family game night! It‚Äôs fun to play this childhood game with my grandson to help reinforce his color knowledge, too.If you have a high-energy kid, the thin cards will get creased and bent straight away, which is to be expected with any game that uses cards rather than a spinner. No worries. It means your game is getting plenty of use, which is the entire point, right?If price is more important to you than time, shop around locally.  I overpaid on Amazon and found out later I could get this exact version for $7.99 elsewhere.My other issue is the board design I received which is too busy (see my photo). It makes it difficult for beginners to distinguish the path from the other game board illustrations. If this bothers you, too, try looking for the Retro Series Candy Land edition.Yes, I‚Äôd buy Candy Land again, but I‚Äôd do a bit more checking on prices and different editions first.",4.0
115,B00000DMF5,R1JE22M7UI8OIJ,No longer suitable for younger children,"  The new layout of this game is terrible for young children. The spaces are too small for the game pieces (which is challenging for little hands with developing fine motor skills) and the graphics are way too busy (which makes it hard for a child to easily follow the path). The recommended age range is 3-6, which I think was accurate for the original design, but it is certainly not true now. I was very disappointed when I saw the game board and we no longer try to play it because it is too frustrating for my daughter.",1.0
116,B00000DMF5,R2RQ565H6QK4E3,Not your mother's Candy Land,"  I purchased  this for my granddaughter thinking it was the classic version of the game.  It's not.  The female characters have had lip fillers and boob jobs.  I remember playing this with my children as an early introduction to games that instilled fair play and how to win and lose graciously.  This version has no ""winner.""  It's all about the ""adventure""  which is fine, but then what is the point of a board game?",1.0
117,B00000DMF5,RJWF7DKR4K3E3,My granddaughter loves it,"  I spend spend quite a bit of time with my three-year-old granddaughter and decided it was time to try out a simple board game. My own daughters had loved Candy Land, but I no longer had that version, so I decided to purchase a new one. When I read some of the negative reviews of this version, I was a little hesitant and checked out the reviews for the classic version. It sounded like the older version was poorly made - thin cards, playing pieces that broke easily, so I decided to go with Sweet Adventures. Yes, the board is a little busy, but the path is clearly seen. The spaces on the path do seem smaller than I remember, but the pieces fit on there and my granddaughter had no trouble placing her piece on the appropriate space. A few of reviewers complained about some of the female characters being too sexy and the ""leering Spaniard"". When I opened the game I took a good look at the board and went back to those reviews with a ""what are you talking about"" frame of mind. The Ice Castle princess is no more provocative than Elsa, Jasmine, Belle in her ball gown, Pocahontas, or any other more recent female Disney character. The ""leering Spaniard"" is a pirate; he is supposed to be a villain. There was also a comment about there being no point to the game because there is no winner, but I assume the winner, if that is important to you, is the first player to reach the Castle. The bottom line for me was that my granddaughter and I had fun playing the game together while she is learning basic skills, including following directions and taking turns. She already knows colors, but this, too, is a skill that can be developed if a child doesn't know them yet. There is no reading involved and counting only to two, so it is a perfect game for her age group.",5.0
118,B00000DMF5,R6WON9JEA8JNK,Similar to the game you remember,"  When looking to buy Candyland for my son I was sad to hear that the newer versions of the game have a spinner rather than cards and that the characters have changed and are overly sexualized. I ended up with this versions and am happy with it. It has cards and while some of the characters are different from what I remember, they are not dressed in lingerie with lollipops over their breasts. My 4 year old lives this game and it's a great introduction into board games. Taking turns, matching colors, following rules, and sometimes losing are all great skills he is acquiring by playing this game.",5.0
119,B00000DMF5,RQP8QWE6T4KBD,Perfect for younger children,"  My 3YO wanted to play the board games we have for adults. We tried to make them work, but they are hard to understand. This is perfect because it's simple and completely understandable for a younger child. The game is bright and fun. It also takes me back to my childhood so there's some nostalgia. As an adult, it's a game I don't mind playing multiple times in a row",5.0
120,B00000DMF5,R3K8C2GU6Z5WX6,Perfect gift for kids and fun for the whole family,"  I ordered this for my 5 year old daughter and we had a blast. I enjoyed the optional game play they offer that each turn you pick 2 cards and choose which one you want to use. It not only helped the game go faster if we were in a bit of a rush, but it helped my daughter with developing logic and strategy skills. We played the regular way as well and it is always exciting when someone gets a character card and gets sent across the map. I highly recommend this game.The size was perfect and the colors bright and attractive.",5.0
121,B00000DMF5,R3U02GHYC5Z8MF,Version sent was not the version shown,"  I purchased the World of Sweets version, but the game that came was not the version pictured- it was the cheaper, flimsier version. I specifically didn't want the cheaper version due to the reviews that indicated it was poor quality.  I had to send the game back- fortunately Amazon makes it very easy to do so.  I'll probably try to buy this in the store, where I can make sure I am getting the right version.",2.0
122,B00000DMF5,R302SL08R0DPB4,Horrible images,"  I bought this and quickly returned it because the illustrations are repulsive. I grew up on the 1984 version. Just take a look at the Queen Frostine and compare them between the two versions. No wonder women have a hard time these days and constantly feel like they aren't enough; these unattainable bodies lead to more plastic surgery etc. Milton Bradley should be ashamed, you are following in Disney's footsteps.",1.0
123,B00000DMF5,R2TJUX29AKHW5C,Slight changes from what I remember as a kid,"  So, this was purchased as a gift for my 4 year old for Christmas. She enjoyed playing it and was very happy with the purchase. It came in pristine condition as was to be expected from a ‚Äúnew‚Äù purchase. I only took a star off because Hasbro seems to have altered the game board from what it was 20 something years ago when my sisters and I played with it. Same idea, same game play, just lacks nostalgia (which has no impact on the kids, just us parents). Also, I don‚Äôt remember having so many double pieces as it has now, so the game goes by pretty fast.",4.0
124,B00000DMF5,R2ETZV3H3P9VE7,Candyland almost like how I played it when I was a child,"  This is a classic game and my kids love it, too. Their attention span varies but gameplay is relatively quick in this game. I don't let them cheat and not go backwards, when they choose on of the character cards that they've already passed. I feel that it teaches them good gamesmanship and how they can't always get what they want (and how to deal with disappointment). We've ha some meltdowns and refusals to continue to play ... but these are life lessons that Candyland is teaching - so thankful for the opportunity to remember and share my childhood with my kids ... and also teach them how to be human beings. The game pieces are of the same quality, the board is the old-school type that folds in half and is solid. The cards are the same bendable (and too easily creased) quality that I remember in my childhood. The actual board/gamepath and the character cards have been redesigned. I prefer the old one where the cards were the actual people, rather than just symbols (e.g. a picture of the blue princess vs. a snowflake). I'm almost 40 and I still remember picking up that princess card and feeling like I won the lottery.",4.0
125,B00000DMF5,RDOJJZG8XKQQ,They love to the the thrill of being at the very ...,  Remember playing candy land when I was little so I bought this board game for my children this Christmas and they played 2+ hours Christmas then again this morning for several hours! They love the thrill of being at the very end and getting a cinnamon roll card lol,5.0
126,B00000DMF5,R203UO0G3BDPUI,Old people must be writing the bad reviews,  This game is so cute! My 5&7 year olds love this game and I love playing it with them. Not sure why there are negetive reviews. Have you seen the original Candyland game compared to this one? lol this is a major upgrade. This is the dusted off version of the old Candyland I grew up with. This game board is so colorful and bright and there is nothing inappropriate on this game or suggestive. The people complaining about this game are also the people complaining about millennials and touch screens. We will be keeping this one!,5.0
127,B00000DMF5,RGN29EDGJHJUS,Very disappointing,"  First of all, the game pieces are too big for the board. One piece fills more that one square! And there is no way to put more than one piece on a square. The board is also incredibly overstimulating for kids because it is SO COLORFUL and every inch of the board is jam packed with as much stuff as they can fit on it. My young kids (correct age for the game) can't focus on the path. This was my favorite game growing up, and I'm going to have to buy the retro version that being sold or search thrift stores for an earlier version.",1.0
128,B00000DMF5,R1H5XDJFA62RL4,Great game for little ones,"  Candy Land is the perfect game for little ones who can't really use logic or strategy yet, but still want to be able to play a board game.  They only need to know their colors and they're set to go.  My grandchildren love playing Candy Land when they come visit.

129,B00000DMF5,R28V20RFKSXPMX,New board design is just terrible!,"  Board games are more and moreNot what they used to be. A now parent who is cycling through these games a second time around from when I was a kid playing them myself, the pieces and boards have gotten so thin and cheap. The playing board is so small and the images and path are jam packed on the board completely taking away from the play space, story line and adventure! The board is so busy it is hard for small children to follow the path as it gets lost in all the pictures around it. Nor are they able to take in what is going in each section of the board as they travel through candy land to get to candy castle. All the colors are bold and bright making your eyes unable to focus as an adult let alone a three year old. This is a perfect example of less is more. There are so many cute details that just simply overlooked because are crammed on a small board. The game pieces hardly fit on each color square. I am very disappointed. Apparently, the board has been was redesigned many times and most recently in 2002 or somewhere around there. The 2002 version gives much more breathing room allowing kids of all ages to better take in what is happening in the game/story.",3.0

Sadly, I discovered this year that many of my special needs kindergartners did not know their colors, even toward the end of the school year. I purchased this game, which NONE of them had ever played. They were enthused and begged to play it. I started to see progress before summer began. If you‚Äôre reading this and have kids, put down the iPads. Interact with your children the old-fashioned way - board games that encourage sportsmanship and bonding time with your children.",5.0
131,B00000DMF5,R3UCPR34TNVWCN,"Sharing, turn-taking, good sportsmanship.","  My two-year-old granddaughter loves this game. She  follows some rules and makes up others. For example, she has learned and loves taking turns. She loves choosing a card. She has learned and loves saying the card color and counting ""One"" or ""One, twoooooo"". She is learning to follow the path. She rejoices in everyone's turn.But she has also decided she only wants the candy/sweet cards and looks through the pile to find them. She doesn't care about reaching the castle. She usually doesn't follow the path correctly.The life skills and game skills she is learning and the fun she has all make the rule-changing worthwhile. So, fellow boardgame purist, don't insist that your little ones learn and follow all the rules. That will come in time.  Sharing, turn-taking, enjoying the success of others---these are the skills that are truly worth practicing by playing this game.",5.0

Coupled with the small pathway, it is actually difficult to pick out the path and certainly spaces are too small for little hands to place and move markers around.  We are returning this.",1.0
133,B00000DMF5,R30MW0L27B9TMX,So fun!,"  This game is so fun, no matter what age you are! This comes with instructions just in case you need to remind yourself of the rules or how to play, but it is very straight forward! I personally like to use one of the tops of the boxes and spread out the cards. Once you pick a card, we put it back in the box. This way, everyone could get the best (or the worst) of the cards and it makes it way more fun than just one person getting the ""special"" candy/dessert cards. LOVE this game and would highly recommend!",5.0
134,B00000DMF5,R1CXXV7G5IQ1Z8,The perfect classic game,"  Candy Land is the perfect classic game for the whole family.  This game is basic enough for small children and as an adult it is still fun and exciting.  It has brought back so many fun memories for me.  I am so happy that I can share this fun game with my children.  No skill is required and because it's all about matching colors it's a very simple game.  There is a reason it has been around for so long.  Also, the pieces are large enough they aren't a choking hazard.  My 5yr old and I played and my 8mnth old just chewed on the pieces we were not using.  It was a win win for all 3 of us!",5.0

136,B00000DMF5,R2KHXA1Y6LSAT4,Very good for a first Board Game,"  I rate toys using a 3 category system. I look at their entertainment value, durability, and creativity. Every toy needs to keep a child's attention, be able to stand up to their rough playing, and either promote their creativity or be used to play in creative ways. I'll start with a short review and then explain my reasons for the rating in detail.We bought this for my 3-year-old daughter for Christmas, and it has been a big hit.  Her and her 2-year-old brother beg to play it everyday when I get home from work.  It is fun and colorful, and helps to teach them how to be patient and take turns as well as how to have fun, even if you don't finish first.ENTERTAINMENT:Candy land is simple enough for a 2-year old to figure out, and fun enough not to make the parents who have to play with them completely miserable.  It brings back memories from my childhood, so I have a lot of fun playing as well.My daughter loves counting the colors, and she loves narrating her path and telling stories about how she met Queen Frostine on her way to King Candy's castle.  My son loves drawing the cards and moving his piece along the path.DURABILTY:The board is very sturdy, but the cards get pretty messed up pretty quick.  My son has already crumpled up the cupcake card, so we know when that one is coming in the stack. There is a version of this game that has a spinner instead of cards, which they got from my brother for Christmas (what a coincidence), but my kids enjoy picking a card more than using the spinner.CREATIVITY:My daughter gets pretty creative telling stories about the Candy Land characters, but the best part about this game is that it teaches kids how to be patient and wait for their turn in a creative way.My kids are pretty patient for being toddlers, but they are still toddlers.  When they want something, they want it, and they usually aren't willing to wait for their turn.  But within a few minutes of playing, they were remarkably good at taking turns.  They cheered each other on, even if the other one just passed them up.  They loved every minute of it.Outside of game play, I have noticed them taking turns with toys and not fighting as much.  They still fight, just not as much. They share their toys a lot better.  I didn't expect that to happen. I don't think people really think that a board game would be able to teach kids life lessons, but its surprising how they carry the little things into their everyday interactions.In conclusion, this is a great way to introduce children to board games and teach them patience and good sportsmanship.  Its a must have for young children.",5.0

The board is so thin and the spaces are so cramped together and difficult to distinguish from the next. The playing pieces consist of a wide plastic base in which you insert thin cardboard figures. The plastic base is so too wide for the spaces on the board and blocks the playing area too much.

141,B00000DMF5,R2S71H4DU53HDF,Still a favorite,"  I couldn't wait to buy this for my 3-year-old granddaughter since it was so well loved by my children and also my cousins and me way back when.  It's very simple and straightforward, and I even enjoy playing it myself.  The 3-year-old loves getting out the game and discussing the pictures and screaming with joy when she gets a special treat card - even if it sends her back to start!  She doesn't quite get the concept of the game yet and is a little bored with just moving her piece, but she likes the idea of being able to play one-on-one with an adult and without her younger sister - who really at 18 months just cannot be trusted not to mess it all up. We're working on the concepts of taking turns and following directions, and this is a good teacher.  You only need to know your colors and how to count to 2!  The only negative is the board design, although my granddaughter is fascinated with it.  It seems too bright and busy and kind of distracting for a child who often just wants to discuss the scenes.  It's still bound to be a favorite, as expected, and we play at least once a day.",4.0
142,B00000DMF5,R3OMO7I09I0HCZ,"Classic Game, Great Gift!",  Bought this for my 3-year-old nephew as a Christmas present.  He's been able to learn how to play with it assistance from his parents and really enjoys it.  It appears the box art and graphics have been updated; I prefer the classic look.It's very hard to beat for the price.  At a little under $10 it makes the perfect gift on its or can be combined with something else to help reach your budget.,5.0
143,B01JYVHMVA,R31BWZYF9DKUWH,Prefer older verision but still a stellar game,"  You will probably think I'm super extra to thoroughly reviewing this game but I can't help it. I bought this because it was dirty cheap, coupon on top of a lightning deal on top of a sale, it was less than $5. Clue was one of my favorite games growing up, period(I even had a computer game version) I actually still have my old game (which I'm comparing to) but is missing the weapons an out of the clue sheets to track your clues so I figure what they hay and purchased this version.Boards are petty much the same, the rooms are the same, they have the same secret passages, only main difference is the new version is much brighter.Another difference you'll note is Mrs. White is no more, if I have to guess I might suggest her name was the reason for that...they now have Ochid.The rooms and weapons are the same. The character pieces are nooo fun. The pieces from the old game actually look like people, we use to fight over them as kids based on who they are, now I feel like they would just request their favorite color. Super lame. The character pieces is apparently a pretty big deal to me because for some reason this really upsets me that they are now just basic pawns.Obviously the cards are updated. More modern. They no longer have a yellow confidential envelope but instead a place one with a simple question mark on it.Game play has changed some as there are now ""magnifying glass"" option on the dice. If you roll them you get to pull a hint card. I hate change so I'm not a fan of it but I guess to stay relevant they do want to make some changes.All in all, clue is still a great game, this is a fully functional game, none of the pieces were missing, it was delivered on time, undamaged and unopened, price was fabulous, definitely a good game to play for older children or nerds on game night but I do prefer the old one to the new  everyone should own the game clue or play it in their life.",5.0

I will focus on the game quality itself. I don't like how they are making the boards now, they fold it on two panels to make the box smaller. My issue with this is that when you open the board and lay it flat on the table, the crevices that are cut stick up from the table, making the board not been properly laid on the table. The cards it self-are very thin and cheap. The corners started to peel just after shuffling them a couple of times. I paid $11 here, but at the store, they have them for almost $20, not worth that price. Everything else in the game was good, I just wasn't too happy with the quality of the material.",4.0

No doubt i won't order this again as the contents listed are completely false of what is actually in the box.,1.0
147,B01JYVHMVA,R2W3XFYFIXP6WW,Classic Deductive Fun,"  My grandchildren  and I have been enjoying playing the game out foxed. Which is sort of an easy clue game..  Even though it is for young kids even the 12 year old enjoys playing it.  So I decided that with my youngest in Kindergarten and starting to read it was time for the real clue  Everyone loved this one two, We played it 4 times in a row. This one is just like when I was young, except it has added some special cards that increased the fun,  Things that reveal an extra card now and then.  So we recommend this as a great family game with a long history of helping kids use deductive reasoning.That said,  we could not give this particular game 5 stars because 8 of our clue cards came with black ink smears that made them hard to read. See photo.",4.0
148,B01JYVHMVA,R1GKR9ZNRTTMS6,For $8 this can't be beat for a fun light-weight game,"  I am more into modern board games (Descent, Pandemic) but when I saw this low price and an updated version of the old Clue I figured why not.  This is a fun, simple filler game or way to start of the game night.This is quite enjoyable as a two player game but I think it would be more fun to max out the player count if you can.  There is some strategy here in what you reveal to other players or what you don't reveal.  Careful note taking during the game is key.  I would like to see character miniatures instead of plain old pawns, but for $8 it's a steal.  I almost purchased the Star Wars version but seeing the play through on Dice Tower and reading how horribly broken that game is on Board Game Geek (although there is an interesting variant) I went with this version instead.",5.0

I don't remember there being cards wherein ""the person to your left has to show you a card."" We don't use those often because with three players, the game is over so quickly. You don't need to pay for thr original or retro versions, this one words just fine and the box is easier to store.",4.0
151,B01JYVHMVA,R1R9MTU3CW9SRG,Not for adults,"  This review is for adult board games. I wanted a game my husband and I could play together, just the two of us in the evening, and I got ‚ÄúDr. Lucky‚Äù, ‚ÄúClue‚Äù, and ‚Äú221B Baker Street‚Äù. 221B was the hands down winner and the only one we have played more than once.CLUE:Too easy, bored out of our gourd. There is no analysis, no player involvement. It‚Äôs simply a matter of deducing which cards are in the center of the board.I feel a little guilty about this rating, as I‚Äôm sure Clue is fun for children, and the more the merrier (it is essentially the interaction of the players and the beautiful graphics which creates these warm memories and not the challenges of the game itself). We only played the game once and gave it away to Good Will so children could enjoy itDr. Lucky:This review is on the card game not the board game. In spite of each having college degrees, we are not smart enough to play the Dr. Lucky card game. The written rules were very elusive: not what we were looking for. We want the game to be mysterious, not the rules. There is a lot of point taking, but what is the purpose since the winner is solely determined by whoever kills Dr. Lucky? So what difference does it make how many points you have? Fyi, Dr. Lucky is the only game we looked at in which the players determined the outcome of the game. The cards are beautiful and the writing clever.221B:Fabulous Game! Wonderful Sherlock Holmes ambiance and a classic feelI don‚Äôt know how anyone cannot enjoy this game, there is involvement, analysis, deduction, the moment the lightbulb goes off (the brain tease), player pay-off (or, as they say for books, the ‚Äúreader pay-off‚Äù), and only 2 players can play it and have fun!So there you have it, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.",1.0
152,B01JYVHMVA,R27IF9GIQ0J3H1,Get a Clue - buy this game,"  I remember playing Clue as a kid, and it was pretty fun even though we were almost certainly playing it wrong.  Now, picking up a copy for just a few dollars, this is a blast to play with my children.  Most of the familiar characters are there: Col Mustard, Prof Plumb... Mrs. White is missing, but there are some new faces as well.Yes, the theme is solving a murder mystery, but it's still very family friendly.  The outcome is selected randomly, but that doesn't make it any less fun when one of the people playing the game turns out to be guilty.  :-)If you are currently Clueless, I highly recommend picking up this game.

154,B01JYVHMVA,R31TP5TZWLLNYL,"Get a ""Clue"" and get this.","  My daughter's favorite game.  So much so that she wore out our classic version and we ended up having to get this.  It was on sale for under $9, so why not?I like the changes.  Two dice instead of the classic single die leads to quicker game play.  The ""Clue"" cards help speed things along as well.  I do wish they'd have added Dr. Orchid instead of just eliminating Mrs. White, and I wish they'd add ""Agent Orange"" to the game as well.",5.0
155,B01JYVHMVA,R1KOQ64UJRG55O,Not as cool as the classic version of the game.,"  I debated whether to order this stripped-down, modernized version of the game or another, higher-end version of the game when I decided to get ""Clue"" for my kids.This set is okay, but because it's so basic, it doesn't ""set the mood"" for Clue nearly as much as some of the other versions do, and for that reason, it's less fun. Everything is just a bit plain. The grids on the board are just white. The player pieces are just little plastic bits like you'd find in a Sorry set. And so on.This game also adds a new innovation (extra Clue cards that have instructions on them, like showing some of your clues to another player) that I'm not a fan of. They're trying to make the game more ""hip"" or something‚ÄîI can absolutely imagine a bunch of people in an office meeting room with the boss saying, ""Okay, let's update all of our games to have a more 'Cards against humanity' feel, since that's what sells these days. For Clue, what should we add?""Point being... I don't like it. The point of Clue is to play with mystery and problem-solving and just a touch of murder Noir. It's a mood game. It's not a laugh-giggle-go-nuts-with-crazy-instructions party game. I pulled those cards out, I think they hurt the game rather than improve it.My advice‚Äîif you want to get Clue, spend another $10-$20 and get one of the better editions of the game with a nicer board and nicer pieces that can help to support the early century period, noir, semi-steampunk vibe of the game rather than making it feel so 'ironic dime store hip,"" which in my opinion just doesn't fit with the game's overall theme.Also‚Äîsince Amazon asked me to provide a ""Giftable"" rating for the game... I wouldn't get this edition for a gift, either. It would look fairly chintzy. This edition feels like a sub-$10 board game, which it is.",3.0

While I miss the original ""retro"" version this updated one is nice as well.  My kids really enjoy playing it and it's fun for our whole family--even though that sounds like a cheesy line from a commercial, it's true!  The one and only reason that I have dinged my review to 4/5 stars is because of the quality of the actual board.  It is a bit thin and flimsy and the way it folds into quarters, I can tell it will wear down fast, unfortunately.  It is nowhere near as thick and sturdy as the typical boards of the boardgames that fold in half rather in quarters.  I get that the manufacturers are probably trying to make the boardgame more compact and easy to store in a smaller, square box rather than the typical bigger rectangular boxes, but I'd rather have the longevity of the better made boards over perhaps slightly better storage.

The clue card is a different spin that seemed a bit unnecessary, but doesn't make it any less fun. The pieces didn't feel cheap like with some remakes of classic board games. The price on Amazon was cheaper than in store, for the exact product which was something that prompted me to buy on Amazon, as opposed to in store. I gave this to my daughter who loves 80's movies and board games, including clue, which is one of her favorites. She was only disappointed that Mrs. White was replaced with Dr. Orchid.

173,B00000IVAK,R2H0WSHLEEFREW,Quality dropping fast...,"  Poor Quality Control from manufacturer.  Printing of the card symbols on the 'board' is off-centered by a good half-inch.  Doesn't affect game-play, but is pretty pathetic considering the price.  Also, the company is so interested in cutting corners now that the plastic tokens aren't two sided... so gone are the good old days when after a Sequence, you flip the 5 tokens over to freeze those chips.  Quality goes down, company profits go up.  Well... review ratings can also go down guys.",2.0
174,B00000IVAK,R1PJGNQVY743VF,A combination of card and board game with lots of strategy,"  We love to play games as a family.  There are four of us that usually play: my husband and I, our 9 year old daughter, and my 83 year old mom. We enjoy playing both board and card games and Sequence is a great combination of both!The game itself is really simple to learn and played in up to three teams. When the four of us splay, we find it simplest to play two teams of two.  The game indicates that it's for ages 10 and up, but my 9 year old had no trouble mastering it, although she sometimes doesn't always pay attention enough to the strategy aspect.  My 83 year old mother also has trouble with strategy sometimes!I like that a game usually goes quite quickly (less than one hour).  This is definitely a new favorite for us and I highly recommend it.",4.0
175,B00000IVAK,R3FQDUC51XBXVA,"Great game, easy instructions & affordable","  This is an easy to learn game that has a different game play every time!  It's a bit of bingo and poker combined.  You can have 2-3 teams of single players or multiple players.  The object of the game is to create a 5 card sequence much like bingo.  Players put down a card and add a chip to one of the 2 locations of that card on the board.  Although the goal is to create a 5 card sequence, players can strategically place chips to block the others.  The twists are the one-eye jacks (can remove a chip from your opponent's growing sequence) and the two-eye jacks (wild card that allows you to place your chip anywhere on the board).  My 13 and 10 year-olds really enjoy the game.  It captured their attention for 3 - 4 rounds in one sitting.  As compared to the multi-page instructions of the Euro-games, this game is more approachable both in terms of complexity and set-up.  In addition, its affordable cost is excellent for multi-generational families.  An 8 year old child will have as much fun as an an 80 year old great grandmother!",5.0
176,B00000IVAK,RHRX3YB0ETG6H,A fun game that's good for hours of entertainment,"  This game is so much fun. My husband and I started playing about a month ago and are learning more each time we play. We learn more about strategy and about each other's competitiveness. LOL. On the surface the game is pretty straightforward. The goal is to develop two Sequences of five chips each. The first player or team to do this wins the game. This is easier said than done. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a deck of 52. The board contains a thumbnail image for each card in the deck. Once the game starts the first player lays down a card and places a chip on the board representing the card he or she has just laid down. Then he or she picks up a new card from the deck and then the next player takes a turn. There are a few little twists and turns in this game that pump up the fun, like the one-eyed and two-eyed Jacks. Those guys are powerful! Fun for the whole family.",5.0

178,B00000IVAK,RHV0G358F6M43,Game is classic but product quality degraded.,"  This review pertains not to the game in general but the quality of the product lately. I have had the exact set before but I took it to a friends place once and it never came back! They loved it...so much for the game itself.I ordered it again in December 2018 but was disappointed to see that quality of the materials used has deteriorated considerably. The chips are lighter, cheaper plastic, the fold-able board seems fragile, the card deck is very very light - almost feels a tad thicker than printer paper. Instructions now printed on what seems like recycled paper (I don't mind that, but worth noting). Yes, I did get it for a bargain at $12. However, now it makes sense why the price was low. Too bad that they made it look like an offer price. Honestly I would not mind paying $20 for a better quality version. Should have tried the Tin case version, but who knows if they are any different.If anyone is reading for what the game is like - CLASSIC. Just buy this, easy to learn and a lot of fun to play!",2.0
179,B00000IVAK,R23203GIOI6E7H,This game was perfect for her,  Got this for my 5 and a half year old daughter. This game was perfect for her. After playing a couple times she quickly because proficient and learning some strategy and it because her favorite game. This game is great because you can play strategically with advanced players or go easily on new players to let them learn and not smash their spirits. We had lots of fun playing this with teams of larger groups and with just two people. I would say 5 and up for the age range. Adults had lots of fun too.We marked or put stickers on the back sides of the chips. That way when someone got a sequence we flipped the chips over so show they couldn't be removed anymore.,5.0
180,B00000IVAK,R3MMLJKXTA7HUI,"Fun, easy to play, game of chance and strategy","  My daughter got this for Christmas and the family has enjoyed playing this game quite a lot. There is some strategy to the game if you want to win, but the element of chance plays a huge role in this game. There are very few rules and the game easy to learn; easy to play.To clarify, the game comes with only 3 different colors of tokens. Many people can play at the same time, but no more than 3 teams. So you can play with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, or 12 players (any number divisible by 2 or 3). Of course, with too many players, each one will hold very few cards, limiting his options. We've had the most fun with 3 or 4 players. Still hoping to try 6.",5.0

The only thing I wish, would be for the chips to have a marker of sorts on one side, so that you can identify finished lines without doubling them up. On the other hand, I have an old bottle of bright gold nail polish which will serve just as well to mark the chips.",5.0
182,B00000IVAK,R382MCJH1UKT3Q,A definite stable for the game closet!,"  So happy I bought this game. A definite one to have in your game closet. Played with regular playing cards, corresponding to the playing card pics on the board. Placing chips on the board according to what cards you hold.. Object is to get 5 chips (of your/or your teams') in a row. A sequence. If you are playing with four people. Two sequences first for your team, wins. Wild cards make it fun, just when you think you have it! Fairly quick game. Easy to learn.",5.0
183,B00000IVAK,R10TONEP9UFEC9,Family favorite - highly recommend this board game!,"  I love this game!! The first time I played it at a friend's house, I liked it so much that I ordered it on Amazon later that same night!! We have over 40 board games in our game closet, and this one is in the top 10% of group games we like to play. You can play it with only 2 people and it's still fun, but we prefer to play it with 4 or 6 people. When family members come over and I suggest various other board games to play, they frequently say ""We want to play Sequence instead!"" It's an easy game to learn, and involves strategy (but not to the level of something like Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, The Palace of Mad King Ludwig, or Agricola). Game play is made more difficult because you can't ""talk across the table"" to your team member(s) to strategize, but that just adds to the overall fun!!! By the way, you'll want to price compare for this game. Historically, Amazon has been the cheapest place to buy it. I bought Sequence on Amazon a year and a half ago and paid $13.99. It's now down to $9.97 on Amazon. During the Christmas holidays, Walmart was selling Sequence for like $17 or $18! It's gone down now - but my point is to shop around for the current prices! :) Anyways, I highly recommend this board game - it'll be a family favorite in your household!!",5.0
184,B00000IVAK,R2GR5FW25VH8RG,Depends what you like,"  I played this a long time ago and remembered liking it so I recently purchased it to play with my large family. We have been trying new games weekly. We love Connect 4 and Penta (for 2 players, the 4 player was not fun). I liked this game but it wasn't amazing. My kids got tired of it towards the end of the game. I think maybe for a 2 player it is better because you can be more strategic, that strategy doesn't translate as well on teams especially where you can't talk. It was good, but not great. I ended up returning it because I knew it just wouldn't be a game we would play that often.",3.0
185,B00000IVAK,RIWBDBEQ0RFT9,"Should be named ""Draw Jacks and Win""","  This game has potential but needs to be tweaked somehow.There is some strategy, but it's mostly about luck. Jacks are the key to the game: Jacks can be used as wildcards or to remove an opponent's chip.If you draw more Jacks than your opponent, you will win, as simple as that.I've only played this game with two players---I think it may play better with 3 players.Suggested tweak: distribute the Jacks equally amongst players at the start of the game, then luck will play less into the outcome and the Jacks will have to be played strategically.",2.0
186,B00000IVAK,R3QRDLHGKV17KI,Great game!  Needed quick fix to play 2 people,"  Love this game - great for 2 to 6 people.  Each person keeps the same amount of cards in their hands while discarding cards that have a matching card space open on the board - placing a chip there.  Once you get 5 chips in a row you win - with two people only you have to get two rows of 5.  When playing with two people only one side of the chips are supposed to be painted to signify the first row of 5 chips achieved....  these chips were NOT painted on one side.  A permanent marker solved the issue easily but should have arrived as needed - loss of a star rating.  Board is small compared to size of delux sized board, but regular game comes with cardboard style board and Delux comes with cloth style board for easy travel.",4.0
187,B00000IVAK,R20M3R2PGC86ND,This was not BRAND NEW,"  Represented as ""new"", looked new when received because it was shrink wrapped.  Played a number of times with 2 players, and totally enjoyed this game.  The trouble was discovered with 4 players.  The number of red markers was only half as many as the other colors.  We hoped we could substitute poker chips but they are too big and block the square. Disappointing.  We felt cheated.  We speculated that someone returned the game for whatever reason, and the seller assumed it was ""good as new"" and reshrink wrapped.  It was a several months later that we discovered the defect, so we did not return it.  Now we use dimes for the red chips since we have been unable to buy suitable replacements.",3.0
188,B00000IVAK,R19X5CD5U2IWEG,Chips are not painted on reverse side.,"  As this is a favorite game for us, we have had many sets and variations. If you are familiar with the game, you know that once a Sequence is made, those 5 chips are turned over. On all prior sets, the reverse side is painted  or shaded white. This set has a different pattern on each side, but there is no white shading or paint. This makes it very frustrating and nearly impossible to play if you don't have great eyesight. We tossed the useless chips and kept the chips from an old game. On the plus side, the board is nice and sturdy and folds twice. the cards are nice quality also.",2.0
189,B00000IVAK,R5JPUD35SQWAU,Missing Game Board,  I purchased this as a gift for my mom to pass some time at home as she's going through chemo treatments. She wasn't feeling well enough until a few days ago and we were excited to play. The game was still wrapped in plastic and taped shut on all four sides. She opened the box and everything was in there except for the game board. We have missed the return window by a week. Not that the return window is anyone's fault but our own...it just sucks because I would never think to open a game that doesn't have any mechanical parts to make sure all the pieces are in there before it's too late. A game board in the game should be a given.,1.0
190,B00000IVAK,R2VEHJWSL0G0BI,Lousy for adults,"  Played this ONCE with husband vs. brother and sister-in-law.  We were strategy savvy and thought game would NEVER END!  Since we knew to block opponents' sequence, almost entire board filled before a team won.  We had reshuffled and then drew (over and over) dead cards.  Okay for less savvy kids, but use green and black chips.  Rules state red chips are used only when 3 players or teams.  Less chips are needed for 3 so maker produced less red chips!  We'll change rules if ever play again:  All jacks AND JOKERS wild and can't be used to block (cards can still.)  Then should go faster.  Can't imagine trying to play it with more than 4.  There's supposed to be no table talk!",3.0
191,B00000IVAK,R2OH5UHKN1ZNZZ,Fun for all ages,"  I bought this game for my 10 year old son for Christmas. But the whole family enjoys playing it. It is easy enough for grandma, but still fun for me and the kids. It comes with playing cards which each person gets (5-7 depending on how many players you have.) You can play individually up to 3 people, or on teams of 2 up to 6 people. The game board is covered with cards like the cards in your hand. You can put your playing piece down on a card image that matches your hand. Five in a row and you win. For us, the game went much quicker in teams (only about 20 minutes) than playing individually (double that time). Fun for any game night.",5.0

The quality of the cards, chips, and board were perfect, we had no issues. I was able to quickly teach my husband and our neighbors and their kids, and we were up and running and playing for hours. The game is easy to learn, and fun to play as individuals or as teams, simple enough but can get quite tricky once the board starts to fill up! Lots of fun, and kept us very busy and entertained many days during this quarantine. The biggest draw back on this purchase, was the time it took for it to arrive. After ordering it, it took just over 3 weeks for it to arrive which is probably the longest I‚Äôve ever waited for an item to arrive from an Amazon purchase.

193,B00000IVAK,R5BA4RAQWJHJY,Mostly Luck with a Little Bit of Strategy,"  This game is okay.  It is mostly luck of the draw with a small amount of strategy.Pros:  It would be a great game to play with kids.  You can play with 2 people (unlike a lot of games). Very easy directions.Cons: The ""cards"" printed on the board are small and a little hard to see for older eyes....  It is very ""luck"" based.  My husband and I were looking for more strategy-type games (like Rummikub) to play during these COVID stay at home days.  This was not very strategy-based.",3.0

Upon receiving it, the game box, board, pieces are very well built. The first round we played, with four people (ages 4, 7, 10, and an Adult) was easy to learn by all... However, after dealing the cards, there wasn't a single sequence made throughout the whole game play, after every card was played... Just a whole bunch of pieces all over the board... It just seems like a game of luck, based on what cards you get... But you won't know that luck until slowly going through each card and placing down a piece on the board... I can very well see this as a game that sits in the closet until we need to make room for other cool games, that we ultimately Goodwill it.",3.0

197,B00000IVAK,R21FDAJK5VFA3H,Simple but Challenging Game,  This game is very addicting. We originally tried to play while watching a movie but then we got so into it that we could barely take our eyes off the board. If it's your first time playing it will take the first round or two to get adjusted to the rules/strategy but then you will be hooked. My friend introduced this to me. I ended up buying one and introduced it to other friends and they actually purchased it as well. It's easy to learn and can be played against each other or in teams. I love playing in teams.,5.0

It looked like exactly the same version as we bought many years ago. I wanted to have a second set for our vacation home in the mountains. The cover of the box was identical. But the quality of the content is just plain bad. Everything feels cheap - is cheap as a matter of fact. I've never had such a bad quality of play cards in my hands before - never ever.

It keeps those playing having to plan and strategize while waiting their turn, so you are always involved. Best played at a table you can sit around, like a small card table or coffee table as we do.I would call this game a mix between connect five, bingo and cards because you use the playing cards to get five in a row on the board, but it is by chance like bingo because you only can play what you hold... And a bit of strategy in what to play when. It is fun!! Highly recommended for thinkers and game board players. It can be fun for anyone who likes games and can distinguish the different cards easily (age/intellect appropriate). Fun!!",5.0

I used to play with her too when I was younger and I wanted to find her something new that I thought she might enjoy. I played with her and other family members on Christmas and everyone who played enjoyed it. It is also very easy to understand which made it easier to explain to every new person wanting to play.

The board is warped so every time you try and pop the bubble all the pieces go flying unless all 4 players constantly hold down their sides with their hands. The pop bubble CAME BROKEN. It was in multiple pieces and now only works if I carefully put it together every time and hold the board down while we're playing. What a piece of junk. Hasboro made me think this was the original version and it's total crap.

If you just want the game and do not care about how cheap the box is (it ripped when we tried to open the tape), or how cheap the flimsy piece of paper that you have to attach to the cheap plastic base is, then I guess you will be okay.  I wish I could return it, but we ripped the box so I am not sure if they will take it back.",1.0

207,B00D7OAOYI,R1DS5AFWZBSKAI,Dollar Store Quality,"  Confusing rules. Poorly made. Pegs fall off when the lightweight board is even just jostled. Popper hard for kids to press and doesn't really roll the dice correctly. Hard to insert the flimsy paper insert under the side flaps which are supposed to hold it down. Rules are way too confusing. Here's a suggestion, download the classic instruction sheet from 2002 off the internet. Just search for ""Trouble Game Capital"" and there is the perfect PDF of the good old rules you remember. Box is thinner than a cereal box and opens with tuck in flaps, so get a zipper bag to store the pegs in. By the way, the box is not shrink-wrapped, just sloppily taped shut, so use a knife to slit the tape before opening. They've cut every corner for this game to keep the price low. It's dollar store quality, cheap and cheerful. Ignore the red numeral 1 on the dice, it's for some stupid new rule. Likewise ignore the ""Warp"" and ""XX"" markings on the board and just play by the old rules. Better yet look for a vintage set at a thrift store. Just use this cheapie to get started playing.",1.0
208,B00D7OAOYI,R18BDA2Y17QFMH,Lacks In Quality All Around,"  I wanted to get this game for my kids because they had been playing around with a McDonald's Happy Meal version for a while, but that version was problematic and mostly garbage (except for the dice popper).  I saw that there was a 'Retro' edition which I remember as the design from my childhood, but it was a lot more expensive than I thought the game should be. I saw that Hasbro had updated the game  and it was really inexpensive. Since this was going to be a bit of an introduction to board games for my kids I didn't want to spend a ton.That should have been my first clue - that the ""retro"" one was almost 3x the price. The product that arrived is so flimsy and cheap on so many levels. The box it comes in is a thin card stock that barely holds its shape. The game board: there are two components that you need put together yourself for some reason. The plastic part is very thin and very wobbly. The card stock insert (which is the same thickness as the box, by the way) is flimsy. Even the playing pieces feel cheap; There's no weight to them at all. They don't stay on the pegs all that well (the original had holes for the pieces to stand in). I can already see that playing this is going to be a bit of a hassle all around. I know that kids get excited and will end up bumping the table or the board, and the pegs are going to go flying off their location because they have no weight to them nor anything to really hold them to their places. The original board and its pieces were very hefty and an incredible quality when compared to this updated version.The only positives I can give this version is the addition to some variant rules, which will come in handy when the kids want a change, and the dice popper functions rather well. I think I might spring for that ""Retro"" version after all.",3.0

It is a cheap piece of cardstock that you put over the thin plastic--NOTHING like this game used to be.  I am so angry that I spent actual money on this.

This game is great because you can learn the rules in a few minutes and the set up is a cinch. Just put your colored pegs in the correct color coded slots and you are ready for the best part of the game- the popper. I used to love the satisfying click of pushing it and seeing the dice tumble. Getting that number you need is a tiny thrill or getting to send an opponent back is worth a laugh or two.  I love this old fashioned game and appreciate that we can still buy it. It will hold up well for a whole new generation to play and love. This would be a great game to take along on camping trips if the kids get bored or need some down time.",5.0

The bubble in the center of the board does not ‚Äúpop‚Äù which does not allow the dice to flip which is a key component of the game. Without the popping mechanism this game is unable to be played. The game was not shipped in plastic/wrapped according to new product shipping information. It was closed with small pieces of tape indicating that the packaged game had been put together by a third party. I will not be using this seller in the future and am now having to replace the game from a brick and mortar retailer.,1.0

214,B00D7OAOYI,R2UN9N5PTKGJTC,IMPORTANT Detail,"  There are a lot of bad reviews for this version of Trouble because of the board quality/design.  A lot of complaints especially regarding how the paper-thin board graphic sits on top of the thin plastic base. It's important to note that there are two small plastic lips on opposite sides of the plastic board that should hold the graphic in place.  Once I ""installed"" the graphic correctly, we never had issues with it coming off and messing up the board.  It's still fairly easy to knock off the pieces if kids aren't careful, but I see it as a good hand/eye coordination lesson.  I was a bit disappointed with the quality, but had no issues with it once the game got underway.  It's just going to get trashed anyway, especially with young kids.  If they get older and still love the game, spring for a more expensive one, but I assure you, my kids weren't complaining of a cheap game.  They were too busy having fun.  If I had to change one thing, it would be the box the game is stored in.  If that were a little thicker, it would be better.  I don't see it lasting very long and then I'll have to figure out where to keep the board and pieces.  It's about the same thickness as a cereal box.",4.0
215,B00D7OAOYI,R12R8JNUZ3H89P,Super fun game,"  This is such a classic game, and easy for kids to learn. The goal of the game is to get all of your pieces around the board and into the home section that matches your color. You do so by pushing down the pop-o-matic dice. It can sometimes be difficult for kids to roll the dice, as the pop up thing tends to get stuck. The quality is okay. It's not the greatest but for the price I can't complain. The top part of the game is a flimsy paper that comes right off the board. However, it's an overall fun game, and a hit at family game nights.",4.0
216,B00D7OAOYI,REIURWN3FWZJA,"If you like being let down, this purchase is for you!","  What a disappointment!  This was my SO's favorite game growing up.  I went on a board game buying rampage and added this to the list for a slice of childhood nostalgia.  Now I'm particular about my board games.  They have to be in new condition, it has to be a complete set, the box should not be damaged (minor dings from being shipped or in the store okay).  This one just didn't make the cut!Hasbro must have cut every corner to save costs because this feels like something you would find in the dollar store.  Not a quality game like I remember it being.  From the box, to the packaging, to the game itself -- this did not carry the same quality as other games I own from Hasbro, Milton-Bradley, Parker Brothers, etc.Don't know if this was due to Hasbro or to Amazon fulfillment but it did not come in the condition it was promised.  It was sold as factory sealed but came in a battered box (crunched in) and taped at the sides where it opens.  I even started a ticket to return the item but it just wasn't worth the trouble!",1.0
217,B00D7OAOYI,R3LHAUKGVLYN5Z,What do you want for $7?  FUN buy!!!  Cheaply made (and priced) - perfect for a young child who is going to lose pieces!,"  As the price should indicate to you this is a VERY cheap version of the game.  It is ideal for a 4 or 5 year old who is likely to lose pieces.Pros:  Affordability priced!  Can't say this enough!  FUN!  My 5 year old wants to play this NON-STOP!Cons: VERY cheaply made.  It is a thin injection molded piece of plastic with a ""pop-o-matic"" (pom) built into the middle.  Even the ""pom"" is much cheaper than the original which sometimes allows the die to land on the same side multiple times.  It's so cheaply made that even the piece of construction paper which the graphics are printed on comes assembled.  The pieces are loose on the board and fall off if someone bumps the board.Would I recommend you buy this?  ABSOLUTELY!  What do you want for seven bucks?  You get what you pay for.  When compared to the full / quality version of this game it's a 1 star at best.  But when compared with the price it's a 4.5 star.  It's tons of fun to play with your wee-ones!",4.0
218,B00D7OAOYI,R3NJHYC8QK636L,Very cheap quality,"  This is a super cheap version of this game, even for the price. Definitely worth the extra 5 bucks or so to get the original version if you want it to last a while with kids using it (the box definitely won't last). I returned this as it was so cheap looking I was embarrassed to give it as a gift. Now, if you just want the game and no one is concerned about high quality, it did look functional. (side note: mine came packaged in an envelope from amazon which meant the box, which is made of thin cardboard, got squashed. I was a prime member so able to return for free, but not sure if this is always how its packaged)",2.0
219,B00D7OAOYI,R34HL5MNZ54KW8,GREAT CONDITION!,  I don‚Äôt get why so many people said it‚Äôs horrible. This came in perfect condition. Y‚Äôall must be picky lol it went together perfectly. Stuck up on one edge till I realized there are lips on the edge you have to tuck it into,5.0
220,B00D7OAOYI,R37U9TQ88W0U66,Cheap and flimsy version of the original game,"  I can't believe the poor quality of this latest version of Trouble.  I bought it for our autism classroom because of the simple rules and dice that won't get lost or thrown around.  I don't think it will hold up very well.  The plus is that the game board comes with the classic, built-in, pop-o-matic die roller.  The minuses are that the board has a lot of give to it and could probably be bent without much effort.  The board also comes blank and is made of solid black plastic (the classic game is made of clear plastic with the colored game board attached underneath).  This version includes a flimsy cardstock template that you have to place over the top of the board.  There is virtually nothing to hold the template on so I am going to have to glue it in place since it will be subjected to a classroom full of young children with autism who will tear it apart at the first opportunity.  I will go ahead and bring it to class but I'm also headed straight to eBay to see if I can buy a Trouble game from a few years back that is of higher quality.  Poor job Hasbro!",1.0
221,B00D7OAOYI,R1VZ7LVRE13Q4V,Very Cheap Feel to a Classic Game,"  I'm really disappointed in the new version of Trouble.The old version had a nice plastic molded game board. The pieces sat in the holes as you went around and it was sturdy. The board was sandwiched in the plastic, and didn't move.This version feels very cheap. The box does not have a lid that lifts off, instead, the side opens, and you slide the game in and out. It's not a good storage box unlike most games. The board itself is a black piece of plastic with a thin paper covering that has the board printed on it. The paper is not attached to the plastic mold at all! I did find where I could lift it up, and slide it under the slightly wider edges on two sides to hold it down a little better. The pieces sit on top of the pegs, and the paper lifts up constantly. I'm going to have to pull the paper off, and glue it down myself.I'm not too fond of the new ""warp"" which takes you across the board, since Trouble is a quick game anyway. The warp feature makes it a quicker game - about 10 minutes for 2 players.",3.0
222,B00D7OAOYI,R329ZMJ7VM8SSJ,Worth it for price,"  Okay for the price. I bought this for six dollars, and you really can‚Äôt beat that price point when shopping for a five year old. I do wish the top of the game wasn‚Äôt cardboard, plastic would have been a better choice for longevity. However my son is five and likely to lose all the pieces before too long anyway! For now he‚Äôs happy and I‚Äôm happy to have a fun and simple game to play together.  The game board we received shipped fine and wasn‚Äôt warped as others have stated. It‚Äôs very light so you do have to hold it still when it‚Äôs the little ones turn. But for the price, it‚Äôs fine. Not everything has to be expensive and beautiful, kids don‚Äôt care. :)",3.0
223,B00D7OAOYI,R3W00MCQDMFJKZ,Same great game - but very cheaply made,"  This is an updated version of the classic game Trouble. It has some extra gimicks to it, but the game play is essentially the same as always. I loved the game as a kid and was excited that my oldest was ready to play it too.However, Hasbro has really cheaped out in how they're producing the board to the point of making it almost disposable. The game consists of a plastic board with a paper overlay (yes, paper not even card stock) for the board which the pegs fit through. The paper board overlay is, well, thin paper. Mine came already ripped/crumpled in one corner, so was returned. The board is fairly thin plastic, though the pop-o-matic bubble seems to be of reasonable quality (actually hard for a little kid to press). However, since the pieces sit on top of pegs (instead of in cups as in older releases), any time the board is bumped or jostled the pieces are likely to fall out.So still a good game... but if you can find the older boards, it's probably a better bet to go for one of them. I'm planning on buying one of those (still available on Amazon) to replace mine.",3.0
224,B00D7OAOYI,R1CSXXY6SPZFXG,Can't Beat A Classic Board Game For This Price,"  Bought this to play with family every now and then, as I used to play this game all the time as a kid 20 years ago. The product feels cheaper than the Trouble game I remember from 20 years ago; and the actual board game is a cardboard sheet that slides over the plastic molding with the dice bubble in it. Pieces are thinner and not as thick as they used to be as well.HOWEVER! None of this is a deal-breaker, it still is, and plays exactly like the Trouble game I remember. And the cheaper manufacturing I mentioned above can be forgiven because you're getting a colorful board game for just $5-6 delivered to your home in 2 days. RECOMMEND and 5 STARS.",5.0
225,B00D7OAOYI,R1FLZT5M1P2HS6,Okay but I'd spring for the retro version,"  I liked the price of this game. (It cost me less than five dollars.) However, the box was smashed, and the shipping carton did not indicate that it happened during shipping. The game is fun, but I'm not really a fan of the new features. It is cheaply made, but mine looks different and better than the photos in the reviews here. The pieces do seem to jump off the board too easily when popping the dice ball. The ball came looking scratched, and I wonder how long it will last. It's served its purpose so far, but it's not the same as the game I remember. I think I'll spring for the retro Trouble in the future.",3.0

I loved this as a child, so I thought hey, why not get it for the family. My husband has never even heard of this game. What planet is he from? It‚Äôs Trouble!!!It‚Äôs such a simple game, but in my house nothing is simple. It‚Äôs competitive. Really gets the emotions flowing. There may or may not be tears when I land on a peg/space occupied by my children. Lol.They should just be lucky that it‚Äôs Trouble and not Scrabble. Gotta keep your foot on these kids‚Äô neck.

228,B00D7OAOYI,R9IT3CHCJTPAB,SUPER CHEAP!,  The game is A0 Made of super cheap plastic and B) After playing this many times the plastic is SO cheap the popping bubble gets fogged from dents in the plastic.I have bought 6 of these games and NOW they have gone one cheaper and made the popper lower to the dice which causes lots of doubles and triples. it really stinks.

229,B00D7OAOYI,R2K0V1CE9GXYPI,Allows the old and new way of the game to be played.,"  I lost twice in a row the first couple of times. But my girlfriend loved winning. This version allows you to play the old way or the new way. I had no idea there was a new way, but it is also a lot of fun. It‚Äôs worth having for company. I‚Äôd get little zip lock bags for the pieces after you open the original bags to keep everything together. Looks a little cheap with the thin cardboard game board, but this can be laminated or just used carefully.",5.0
230,B00D7OAOYI,R2MPBSCPAV6XXP,Still is a favorite for younger kids.,"  This version of Trouble has added a couple new rules and moves from the old game I remember.The game board itself is made of thin cardboard which can make for tough game play.(Thinking a little glue on the plastic case on the bottom) The games peices like to fall out of their spot as you go around the board. Which makes for the old arguments ""You weren't there"",or ""you're cheating"".This game is a simpler and quicker version of Sorry.  Hasbro should consider improvements to this classic, so game play can be smoother for small children.",3.0
231,B00D7OAOYI,R3FYVJB6BI8OA8,Low quality,  Very low quality. It‚Äôs a tiny piece of plastic with a piece of cardboard that lays over it. It doesn‚Äôt even attach. The popper thing is almost broken after 2 plays. It keeps getting stuck. And my son spilt a little water on it so the tiny sheet of cardboard is ruined so the pieces won‚Äôt stay on anymore. I would understand if this game were $1 but paying anything above $5 for this is not worth it. It‚Äôs way too cheap.,2.0
232,B00D7OAOYI,R2SU7XPOGQQAM7,A flimsy version of the game I remember,"  I remember playing this as a child, and my kids are LOVING it now. We had a small travel version and I wanted to get the full-size version that I remember, so it could stand up to a little more of a pounding. This is the same game (though perhaps slightly more complicated than I remember), but the base is thin cardboard that pops into a thin plastic frame.

234,B013TO5PDU,R1DIYUGJXBLUKM,Children are intrigued,"  This seems to hold my teenagers' attention quite well. The handling of the dice is a foreign concept to them, and Alexa doesn't know who 'did it,' so they have to work for their answers. Finding pencils for everyone was a struggle, but the junk drawer never disappoints. They asked if there was 'an app for this'--which, i'm sure there is, but i lied and told them 'no.' Has been played several times since Christmas, and since we're all at the same table, there has been less text communication. 5 out of 5 stars.",5.0

I was expecting the childhood classic of swirled glass stones, even lowering my standards, solid colored glass stones would have sufficed. I ordered this as a Christmas Gift meaning it wasn't opened until the day after Christmas. When to my surprise, upon seeing the gift opened for the first time, neatly packaged inside were not game pieces... No... instead of game pieces there are what appear to be ""make it yourself necklace beads;"" which are plastic pieces. They are not even the classic colors displayed in the image, but an array of Barbie colors that would make for a lovely Barbie necklace!There were however two extra Barbie necklace pieces... Thanks for that! To make matters worse the pieces are so light that they stick to your hands. They do not pack the same punch as the heavy pieces that go where they are meant to. Instead they fall all over the place.For anyone who has never played this game they may find the equipment to be playable and fine, for the game itself is AMAZING- hence why it was purchased, but again please note that description is INACCURATE!The box however (NOT PICTURED IN FULL) says in small print ""Plastic Beads.""Let us falsely advertise in the description, not provide actual product images, and sell a classic game that will disappoint all but those who do not know what they are ordering.The game board itself is Okay...

It‚Äôs so easy to learn and so much fun when you just have two people that are looking for something to do. I figured it was time to try to teach my kids (daughter, 9; son, 6) how to play. They caught on very easily and it is a ton of fun, but this particular game is very cheaply made. It has two wooden dowels on either side that hold the two boards together, but aren‚Äôt really attached to anything and fall out easily, so then your boards don‚Äôt stay together while you‚Äôre playing. The wood isn‚Äôt really sanded or finished, so it‚Äôs just raw, scratchy wood. I would look elsewhere for a sturdier game that finished and will last for a long time.",2.0

A quick look at Amazon shows several boards, mostly at the $30 to $40 dollar price range, and then this one at less than half the price. That's usually a flag to me, but I decided to take the risk -- how bad could a piece of wood and marbles turn out to be -- and I am sure glad I did. My daughter loves this set, it comes with glass beads, and it plays just fine according to her. I'm honestly not sure why what the deal is with pricing on the others.",5.0

The price is unbelievable compared with other retailers and I went back to buy another as a gift and they were out of stock!  The wood is very nice quality, the hinge seems sturdy, and it looks cute sitting on a shelf out of the box.  The stones store nicely inside.  My only complaint is the stones are not real, but this is probably what keeps the price low. My recommendation is to do what I did: we bought a bag of tiny semi-precious gem stones and use those in place of the glass stones. It is so much prettier and fun that way!",4.0
273,B001FA22DC,R196WTUK8B4RVX,Cup depth could be a little greater,"  Pros: folds up which makes storage easier.Cons: no bag for gems (luckily I had an old bracelet baggie to spare). The depth of the bowls could be a little deeper as well, as once the game gets going some of the ‚Äúhigher traffic‚Äù bowls start spilling all over, but as long as you‚Äôre on a stable surface it‚Äôs fine.

Came packaged in a bubble envelope, game inside a box, stones inside a long Ziploc bag, paper instructions. Good game, pretty easy to understand how to play. The only downfall, which I'm not sure if it's common, was that the bowls are either too small or the stones too big. As many times, the stones were overflowing and falling into other sections. But quality seems to be good, smooth inside and stones were glass looking (maybe glass) in nice colors.",4.0

It is both of these things which is great.  It seems to be well made of quality materials.  The kids and I greatly enjoy playing the game.  However, the marbles (glass stones) are too large for the wells in the game board.  We had to substitute the glass stones with dried beans, which are much smaller and fit more easily in the wells during game play.

The only downsides to this that we have seen is the board wouldn't lay flat at first and we kind of hand to force it. Also the board isn't sanded great so there could be splinters.

Then I noticed that there were several very rough spots in about a third of the pits where you have to get the stones out of.  It looks like those spots were never even sanded or polished or whatever they do to make the pits.  I tried smoothing them myself, but the spots act like they're a different kind of wood altogether, even turning very dark.  To top it all off one of the glass stones has a third of it broken off!  I was going to give this as a gift, but can't now.  Save your money or buy a different brand.",1.0

282,B001FA22DC,R159T520NGQO2,The quality of stones aligns with cost,  I like this Mancala set-- it came with all the pieces and has a wooden base.

I bought this one so that we could take it with us on vacations and over to Grandpa's house. It has worked out great! First, the game is quite fun and there are numerous variations on how to play ranging from short games to marathon-long games. The included instructions provide a couple of game types, but just do a search on Google and you will find many more.Besides being fun, the game has some educational qualities to it. Mostly it helps with counting skills as you decide which pocket to pull the stones from. It also helps with some basic strategy and, depending on the variation of the game played, some basic negotiation skills.The game board is all wood and very sturdy. The stones are, well, stone and not easily broken. The stones and pockets seems to fit a young child's hand much better than an adult's (I have a difficult time getting the stones out when there are more than five or six in a pocket).",5.0

My family has multiple closets full of games and this is our favorite, hands down, better than Pictionary, Monopoly, Trivial Pursuit, Operation, Jenga, Boggle, Scrabble, ConnectFour, Checkers, Chinese Checkers, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, the Tempest, Hamlet, and The Two Gentlemen of Verona combined. Let me be clear: This...game...kicks...BURRITO. First of all, it's simple. You keep five cards in hand at all times and draw from a pile and discard into another as fast as you can, in order to make matching sets. Everyone draws and discards at the same time and usually the game is a giant mess. Second, you throw burritos at each other. You heard me. Occasionally someone draws a set of burrito cards, and then you have to throw burritos at your family members. Sometimes there are tears. Sometimes your daughter gouges one of the burritos with her overlong fingernails, triggering your obsessiveness to keep things looking brand new. Sometimes she gets so angry that she pummels you repeatedly with one of the burritos until her father tells her to stop beating up her mother. Sometimes the dog jumps up and down thinking you are screaming in pain when your are only laughing hysterically as your husband bashes you with a foam burrito. Let me be clear. This is a card game. This is dodge ball. It is the best thing that has happened to our family since the birth of our child.*not really bruised",5.0
297,B07TS96J7Q,R3NNBCD1ZJEHY3,Husband Said We Are Not Allowed to Play This Anymore,"  We're hosting an extended family game night next week and I wanted something new & different to play that everyone would enjoy. Our family loves rummy, PIT! and other card games so I figured I'd give 'Throw Throw Burrito' a try, even though we've never played or purchased 'Exploding Kittens' or any other of their games. And also even though someone in my family tends to injure themselves every single time we all get together.Yesterday when this arrived, my husband and I sat down to learn how to play so that we can teach everyone else on game night. It is easy to learn and appropriate for all ages. It was great fun playing this, even with just two people, and it'd be a lot more fun with a bigger group.So I matched the 'Burrito War' cards which means everyone grabs for a burrito and throw it at another player. I whipped a burrito at my husband's chest except it accidentally hit him in the face because 1) I have terrible (or great?) aim and 2) we were sitting at very close range to each other.Consequently, he informed me that 'we' are not allowed to play this game anymore. When he said 'we' I knew he meant me. I am not allowed to play because I cannot be trusted to not hit him in the face with a squishy burrito. He hid the box but I know where and I am totally breaking this out on family game night!",5.0

Needless to say the ensuing play was hilariously funny and after playing six rounds of the game we were coming up with crazy ideas as to how we could turn it into an all day office game or even take it outside and play across larger distances.Other reviews have called the game ""immature as heck"", but our group found it to be completely hilarious and appropriate for all ages.Note that we played with eight people at the table despite the game only being made for 2-6. I would recommend playing with no fewer than 4 as the rules get modified to accommodate fewer players and it would be significantly less fun. On the flip side, although the game say up to six players, we made it work for eight by reducing each player's personal draw deck that is dealt at the beginning from 15 cards down to 10. It works, but one or two ""slow"" players can lead to all of the cards ending up at one end of the table and the other end waiting for cards to be passed. I wish they had an expansion pack to add more cards and more burritos for an all out ""burrito war"".",5.0

My six year old can play and the duels are really hilarious especially when people miss and you have to keep going until someone gets hit! However the burritos are squishies. And that means they are going to crack if you‚Äôve got young ones who want to squish them. Within 24 hours the burritos were cracking! Now one has a top completely torn off.

I opened the box and blew up the inflatable Burrito and boy did not expect the ginormous size üòÖ. I know they said ginormous in the description but I was expecting like 1 foot. I was wrong. This thing is 3 feet tall and it is a feat in itself just trying to blow it up (took me stleast 10 minutes)! But let me tell you, when you do get it blownup, you cannot wait to throw it at someone! Just the thought of chucking this ginormous burrito at someone was enough to make me so excited for my next game night! I was worried about being able to throw it, because of it's size and that it is full of air, but it has just enough weight to it that you can definitely throw it at another person and have it actually travel.This version of the game comes with 2 Burritos (pictures for scale (I am 5'7"" with 2"" boots on in the pictures)), 2 decks of oversized cards (pictures for scale), and what feel like rubber game pieces (flimsy, bit very solid). The Burritos have two air holes (one at the top to fill the burrito toppings section and one at the bottom to fill the whole burrito).

It was incredibly fun for those who wanted to be very active and have a laugh. For others it wasn't as well received as the pace can be overwhelming for new players. I will say the biggest let down was the durability of the burritos. One burrito only lasted 3 games before getting punctured by a tomato plant..... To be fair it was a very ominous looking tomato plant but it was rather shocking that it would become damaged so quickly. The game comes with a patch kit which was needed and I'm grateful for but as the instructions state you should wait to play with the burrito until the patch has cured which ended that game for the day.With that being said the game is a lot of fun.

I don't know what they're made of... they're softer than marshmallows yet they will last forever (unless your dog gets one maybe?).",5.0

320,B07TS96J7Q,RIGN4CRP7KC2M,FUN,"  I have no idea how to play this game.  We played with a 3 year old and a 6 year old and managed to adjust the rules so that everyone was able to keep up, we went around the circle and dealt a new card to each person and announced matches (rather than everyone sorting through a pile and setting aside matches for themselves).  Anyway, lots of easy games to invent loosely based off the suggested rules.  As long as you keel the ‚ÄúDuel‚Äù, ‚ÄúWar‚Äù and ‚ÄúBrawl‚Äù part everyone will be happy.  My 3 year old was very much excited to be allowed and actually encouraged to throw something at someone.  I actually think this helped us all get some aggression out in a fun way.",4.0

328,B01MU9K3XU,RRGERPPSJ1WXB,Fun Game,"  The item arrived on time and was firmly packaged. All the pieces were included and nothing was bent, scratched or torn. It also comes with a black plastic tray to hold the money as well. The instructional booklet was easy to follow and the board is firm; however, it folds in four so it doesn't lay completely flat. Pennsylvania Railroad will stick up a bit and it's a hard crease on the B & O Railroad. I wouldn't advice being crafty by using super glue, because then it won't fold properly making the board even worse. It has to fold where the creases are, unless you plan on having it remain flat. This isn't the original version of Monopoly, I knew that based on the price, but the goal for me was to have family fun time. There were a few new tokens, T-Rex, the ducky, and the penguin which are fine when you're playing with children. For those adults who played the original monopoly and were used to being the horse, iron or shoe, theses tokens are NOT included.If you're looking for the tradition of the game, this is not for the version for you. (remember, the original board folded in two, this one does not) In addition, the Chance and Community Chest cards are also different in style, and the money is slightly smaller. But all in all, it is a fun game for the family. Although my family and I have played this game a few times, for many hours, and enjoyed it, I gave it four stars because of the fold and creases on the railroads and the inability to lay completely flat without assistance. But overall it serves its purpose.",4.0

When I got my game today the first thing I did... once I saw that one half was in two ( like the reviews) I tried reenforcing it with tape only to realize that the ‚Äútear‚Äù was intentional as it can‚Äôt fold otherwise into the square shape it needs to in order to fit in the box.

But instead of stating that, I guess the company felt that the term ""classic"" is supposed to tell us. How petty! Why not include the speed dice and let people decide if they wish to use it?

The money isn't enough to even start the game with 4 players or the bank will almost be out. Also there is not enough houses or hotels to cover the whole board. You only get enough hotels for half the board so when everyone wants to build you can't. They should at least give you enough pieces to play the game. Also the chance and community chest cards are so few you have to reshuffle constantly to play a full game. They cut costs too much to where you constantly feel the lack of components in every manner.

I removed this card from the set as soon as possible.

So we have no fight on it.But we do feel that the player piece, the green house, the red hotel and the dice are made too small in size, it's not that comfortable to pick them up, especially my husband who has bigger hands. Also, if the seller could provide a small box to keep those small pieces safe, then we would be more satisfied. After 2 months playing, one dice, 2 player pieces and a few houses were missing and couldn't be found anywhere.For what we can tell, another stuff could be improved is the quality of the money.

370,B07YQ641NQ,R26MR5OB9RLXYX,I can't believe I didn't write a review for this game!,"  I was able to get a copy of this game around Black Friday in 2019 for a good price. Shortly after, from what I remember, it was either sold out or the price was heavily inflated. I tend to wait for games to be more than 40% before purchasing, but I just had this feeling that this game would be worth it. And I was right.REWIND: Ever since I was young I loved playing board games even though I was an only child and I spent hours playing Sorry!, Jumanji, chess, Chinese checkers, Monopoly, etc. all by myself (I would call it research now). And the year culminated at Christmastime when my cousins would all come together and we would play board games together.FAST FORWARD: I played more computer games as I got older and then games on iOS. I found Ticket to Ride or Scotland Yard on iOS and I thought those games were great! Little did I know there were PHYSICAL board games of these games, until my neighborhood friend said he played Ticket to Ride too and brought over the real copy and my mind was blown away.I started sneaking into the toy section at Target and found Pandemic. I acquired some expansions on Amazon and that's where I was for 7 years. I played other games in the mean time but I didn't care to own them, because my friends owned them. I moved out of the country and was busy with school. I graduated and came back and low and behold it was Black Friday!I had to do research for prices for Black Friday and I stumbled on Ars Technica that mentioned Wingspan. I didn't care for birds...but the box was pretty...and what? All the cards had different art on them? That's what sold me.FAST FORWARD again! And here we are 6 months later down a rabbit hole with 80+ games, several game groups (mostly online now due to social distancing), and family who are stuck at home and have no other choice but to play games with me :) I also enjoy birding now and recognize the local birds. A silver lining with Covid is that it is during the Spring so I am able to see multiple different bird species flying around in my suburban backyard which fuels my newfound birding hobby.Pros:1. Wingspan is pretty to look at. Nothing ugly. Even the boring American crow starts to look pretty because it feeds the other birds in your bird ""engine"" - which is a combination of cards with birds on them that add on powers and help you on your way to victory.2. Even if I lose, I don't mind it because I enjoyed playing.3. It's fun to read the little info tidbit and learn something new on every single card.4. Information is from reputable sources.5. The game is pretty.6. It is relaxing...and at the same time NOT because there are so many possible combinations that could happen your brain cog wheels are always spinning. Or at least mine are.7. It has a solo mode.8. There is a Swift-Start pack - which are separate instruction mats for players with instructions to help everyone as a group learn how to play the game. This is a helpful tool for people who have no idea what they're doing or you want to teach this game to other people.Cons:1. This could potentially lead you to hobbies like board gaming or birding2. If you're a completionist/OCD and you buy this game, know that you're in for at least 5 more expansions3. If you love artsy craftsy stuff and find the fan-made things on Etsy...you might spend more money than what you thought you were going to spend4. The bird feeder dice tower is a cool gimmick. I say gimmick, because I let my dumb 12-year-old cousin put it together and it was frayed before I even played the game for the first time. However, my husband bought me a proper bird house dicetower from Etsy...and after you have one of those, why would you ever go back to that cardboard thing?5. The game tray. It's flimsy plastic...it looks nice...but when you start to plan on sleeving your cards (which I did after I had to hold back from saying anything while tearfully watching Frito fingers manhandle my cards) you end up spending a lot of time trying to figure out which sleeves to buy and if all the cards will fit in the tray...or do you buy a new tray...and the cycle continues.  Apparently these cards are American standard card size, because there is a European standard card size.  I got the cheapest Mayday sleeves which are also the thinnest, so all the cards still fit in the trays. BUT they feel so thin...and plasticky...They aren't like the NICE sleeves my husband got for Terraforming Mars. ROLL EYES. The cards from Terraforming Mars are wearing out though on the edges and the Wingspan cards are way nicer in quality.SO good luck to you if you choose this dark path toward pretty birds and board game nights.Seriously though, if you think you might like a pretty card game about pretty birds that isn't cartoony and has real information you can learn from, try out Wingspan!",5.0

372,B07YQ641NQ,R2YMD3RNXC1OSF,Best new game in a spell,"  This is a game that manages at once reasonably complex for the experienced player, yet nonthreatening and learn-able for less experienced gamers. And everyone seems to enjoy playing it. It has rapidly become the favorite of several groups I participate in, in a way that no other game has yet done.On a purely aesthetic level.. the game and all the makings are nice. Even the instruction booklet just feels quality in the hand. Only thing letting me down in quality is the cardboard dice tower. And even thats ok, in most games would be good, but is slightly under par compared to the quality of rest of this game.Only two minor gripes.1.. It comes with 4 little plastic bins. But there are 5 types of food, 5 colors of eggs.. slightly annoying to someone who likes to put things away carefully where they belong.2.. The instructions are good, but a few technical aspects of game play could be more clearly spelled out. Easily solved by house ruling, and either way you end up answering the questions, it doesn't break or even really inconvenience the game.All in all.. with hundreds of games in my collection, this is the only one I bought new and have no buyers remorse over.",5.0
373,B07YQ641NQ,R1G4EUPX9O2HIA,Been trying to buy this game for my wife for Christmas for the past 3 years!,"  This is an amazing fun game to play with 1-5 people.  I wanted to get it for my wife because she is an avid birder.At first, she was overwhelmed trying to figure out how to play the game using the instructions that came with the game.  She tossed the papers at me and said, ""You figure this out!""  I fired up YouTube on the smart TV, and we watched a couple of videos on how to play Wingspan.  30 minutes later we were in the middle of first game!  The quality of this board game and it's components is the best.  The only thing that could be slightly improved is the storage for the bird food and eggs.  However, I've already 3D printed a solution from Thingiverse that solves that minor issue.  Even if you're not into birds, you'll still enjoy this game.  It doesn't take long to play a game - about and hour for a game with 5 people.  20-30 minutes for 2 players.  Coming up with different strategies to win is where we are at now with the game!",5.0
374,B07YQ641NQ,R3E6KJR9LXFDIA,"Beautiful, high quality, and very fun.","  This game is stunningly well made in every way. The game pieces are all simple and colorful, and the card tray and game piece trays are all sturdy plastic. The game mats are extremely helpful and well detailed, and the bird cards are all beautifully illustrated. My favorite part is the little bird feeder dice tower, its made of good quality cardboard and makes dice rolling fun and tidy too. Everything can be neatly packed in the box with a helpful item placement guide on the side, which is an excellent addition.The game itself is also very enjoyable, and simple to learn. I played it with three people for the first time and they all did very well, one of them even won even though they only looked at the rule book once. All the bird abilities are simply stated and fun because they all pertain to the abilities of their real world counterparts. Vulture cards, for example, get extra food tokens when another player's predator bird succeeds in ""killing"" a smaller bird. The wide variety of bird cards makes building a strategically designed bird habitat simple and super enjoyable. You almost take pride in the little aviary of birds you hand pick from the pile, and pray that each round you find your favorite bird.",5.0
375,B07YQ641NQ,R3BW0711X9W9V1,A woman‚Äôs review,"  This is an outstanding game in every respect. I confess to having a strong preference for games with beautiful components and this game does not disappoint. From the sweet pastel colored eggs to the birdhouse dice roller to the carefully drawn bird deck, the game is a joy to behold. The bonus cards and special bird powers make for tremendous replayability. It‚Äôs not an overly competitive game in that each player plays for the most victory points and there is no combat. As for complexity, it‚Äôs a mid weight game - more complex than Ticket to Ride, but simpler than Agricola. Once you digest the rules, game play is smooth and not a brain strain, which is not say that it‚Äôs not a game that requires forethought and strategy. It does. It‚Äôs just not overwhelming. But perhaps my favorite thing is that too many games involve monsters and fighting and are otherwise designed to appeal to teenage boys. This is a game my husband and son-in-law also love, but it‚Äôs a game that will appeal to other women who, like myself, aren‚Äôt into the whole DnD theme. We‚Äôve played about a dozen times now, and we are all still loving it.",5.0
376,B07YQ641NQ,R1PVVCTOX4R5J7,Love this game,"  I am not normally a gamer. I don't do well in competition. I get angry if I lose, so I stay away from games in general (not good for my health and my mental state of mind). But this game is so beautiful that I realized during the first playing of it that it doesn't matter whether I win or lose. I always learn something about birds, which is one of my passions. BTW, I am not a competitive birder, either, in real life. Those people drive me (excuse the pun) cuckoo. I just love birds and always have from early childhood.This game was hard to learn at first, but I was playing with three veteran gamers  at our family reunion. I had bought it for a birthday gift for my youngest sister who loves board games and also loves birds.  I kept losing, but it didn't make me angry or despondent, my usual reaction to losing a game. The game itself made me happy. When my husband and I returned home, I bought one for us, and so far we've played it every day. Hey, what else can you do when you're stuck at home because of a pandemic?The artwork is fantastic, and the bird information on the cards is great. It has a learning curve, but that should be expected with a game that is built on strategy, not complete luck. Of course, that element is there too, especially when playing the Automa game (a solitaire game against a player who has different ways of getting points than you do). But luck doesn't overwhelm the game, which is something I really like about ti.I recommend this game to anyone who loves birds. And/or games.",5.0
377,B07YQ641NQ,R33W5UA29IVICD,Daunting,  Not so sure about this game.  I was hoping to learn about birds and instead I feel overwhelmed by game rules.  Does one actually learn about the birds?  Is there a way to play a simplified game without so many rules?I am giving this game away.  I would not recommend it for older eyes.  Hard to read.  Tiny cards.,2.0
378,B07YQ641NQ,R39U491IT2NZ0W,Terrific Family Game,"  Terrific game, I half-expected this to be something that would just appeal to bird fanciers - but its just an all around good family game. The materials are all high-quality, it'll hold up to children playing the game with you. Play is simple (even if it seems complex at first). Its an excellent tool to help someone who wants to familiarize themselves with different bird species and their habitats (not an expert, but all the cards I saw were accurate in the general detail they give).The product indicates its for 14+ but that's conservative. I played it with my ten year old, he beat me in our first game. The strategy is pretty complex (its definitely an engine-building game if you know the term), but the randomized elements are enough that some chance just plays into it for people even if they're a casual player against a strategic one.The dice-roller is also a bird house. Terrific and fun; it kept the five-year old who didn't play entertained just rolling the dice for us.",5.0
379,B07YQ641NQ,R27BYE3S8459GA,Great addition to my game collection,"  The game is made from quality materials (except the birdfeeder is a little flimsy ). As someone used to playing this style of game ( i‚Äôm a regular player of Lords of water deep, terraforming mars, above and below, near and far, city of iron, Islebound), I picked up on it easily and quickly.  For someone not used to managing different resources it might be a struggle at first. But they provide helpful starter guidance cards to walk novice players through their first several turns allowing them to get the hang of what the actions and steps are. That was so helpful!.  It is a very pretty game. Unlike a lot of games I play with this one you can do fewer moves with each turn/round whereas other games seem to start slowly and then you can do more and more things with each turn/round. Put a nice different spin on things and help to really focus and towards the end of the game on what was important to accomplish",5.0
380,B07YQ641NQ,R2XVYKZPR5PUFB,"Wanted to hate this game, but...","  I wanted to hate this game. I am a serious gamer and this looked utterly ridiculous. A gamer friend felt the same, but because he wanted to buy a game and the only way his wife would let him is if he bought Wingspan, he relented. He then had the audacity to bring it to my place and I gave it a try. Two hours after he left I bought it. I love the artwork, the birds are well represented artistically and the educational value is fantastic as it gives the genus of each bird. There is ample strategy to go around and as the game progresses your turns become fewer and fewer, which I initially thought would be an annoyance, which it is, but it is very strategic and prevents you from playing in a carefree manner, you need to plan, which is a great component. IT is pretty simple to learn, we taught our 7 year old daughter, though if you have kids that age, make sure they are gamers, as this would not be the game to introduce to young children. As the game progresses, decisions become harder to make and even though our daughter is an ""experienced"" 7 year old gamer, the later rounds she needs more time to think through the moves with so much on the board.That said, the learning curve is about a 2.5 out of 5, it has fantastic replay ability given the sheer number of cards, and the expansions just increase that replay ability.If you are on the fence on this, get off, it is worth a buy and will probably visit your gaming table fairly often.",5.0
381,B07YQ641NQ,R2VOU8DP5FKWTM,Thoughtful Design and Fun!,"  While it is a euro-style, engine-building, tally-points-from-stuff game, the concept itself is smart, the artwork gorgeous, and the layout intuitive to help you follow the rules. It has been our go-to for several weeks now as there are plenty of bird cards, which have different functions, and a good mix of random luck (card draws and dice rolls) and strategy (focusing on one or another group and the bonus cards to leap ahead). It also seems to have been thoughtfully made for modifications and different rules, like the option to make end-of-round goals competitive (only one gets the most points, others get less) or cooperative (everyone who can complete the goal gets points). It also is a faster game, taking about an hour to an hour and a half, much faster than something like Agricola or Terraforming Mars. It's also more focused on working your own board rather than ruining others' progress, and many cards give bonuses for others along with a bigger one for yourself.But the crazy thing is how much I love the packaging! Everything goes into its own little provided container and fits perfectly back into the box! The aftermarket board game organizers must rue the neatness of the built-in solution. And of course, the bird theme is everywhere, down to the birdhouse dice roller. Just really smart.Anyway, it's an easy to learn into to euro-style games that still has depth, the ability for expansion, and clear rules.",5.0
382,B07YQ641NQ,R3SPVUQTFVGY45,Great game. My wife and I love it.,"  I'm going to keep this simple.This is a very fun game. Its simple enough to teach to kids (there are some nuances) but its not a brain dead easy game. I say this as a person who likes complex games like Magic: The Gathering and Terraforming Mars. The production value/quality is top notch. The artwork, game pieces, card material/texture, and rule book material/texture add a lot to the games visual appeal. There's also plenty of 3rd party support to ""bling"" your game out if you wish.It seems like this game is pretty popular and stores have trouble keeping it in stock. There's a good reason for that. Stonemeier Games and Elizabeth Hargrave herseslf (creator) frequent the Wingspan facebook group and talk about upcoming expansions and rules clarifications.",5.0
383,B07YQ641NQ,R2JLLJ8KZGZQJX,Stairway to Bird Heaven,"  The ONLY reason you shouldn't buy Wingspan is if you are broke. The Swift Start Pack makes learning this dummy proof! I wish more games would have this, especially the complicated ones. In addition, this Swift Start Pack bring 10 new cards which mostly rock! Its also a different kind of game when playing two players vs 3 or more players, not necessarily a better one, just a different game strategy wise.If you still need convincing...Pros:*It is VERY FUN! I never cared about birds, but seeing the artwork and the funny description on the bottom of the  cards just made me giggle and appreciate the hobby. The production quality of this game is some of the best in board gaming for the price.*Building your bird sanctuary feels VERY REWARDING, and the pacing of the game is excellent. High Replay value.* It is RELAXING! It is not a very tense game, and has very little interaction with other players, yet it still feels like you are competing to have the most ""actions"" on your turn. It feels great to grab cards, lay eggs, grab food, and finally hunt smaller birds ALL in one action!!CONS (These are more nitpicky things I can think of that can discourage some players):*You may have a bad draw through out your game and it can bum you out as there is little you can do to ""fix"" this., though this has not happened to us often.*Seeing someone take a lot of actions in one turn can be frustrating knowing in your turn you will only be able to grab just one measly worm.I am a teeny bit worried about the integration of the upcoming expansions, as the original deck is so large that I feel like the expansions will get ""diluted"" by the main game and its possible that the new cards don't even come up during an entire playthrough, but that won't impact your enjoyment of the base game one bit.**No birds were hurt in the writing of this review**",5.0
384,B07YQ641NQ,R2EMN2KIWLDLWY,Cute Theme Conceals Very Strong Gameplay,"  Cute, fun game with a really engaging gameplay loop. We played with three players and it was a lot of fun. Just reading out the bird names as they came up was fun! The action selection mechanic and the way all the different birds did different things for you was very fun and well thought out. The way the game encourages you to develop an economic engine by setting up a chain of birds on each action slot that triggers every time you perform that action is really excellent as well. We felt it was a very ‚ÄúEuro‚Äù game, with a fun, innocent theme and medium-crunchy mechanics. The art and production quality are also top notch; this is a very beautiful and well-produced game. We especially liked how the player-mats had a ‚Äúleather‚Äù looking design printed on the back side so when they folded up they looked like leather bound portfolios. That was a superb creative touch and something a lot of publishers probably wouldn‚Äôt have bothered with. We thought it added a little extra aesthetic zing to the game and it‚Äôs illustrative of the very high quality of all the game‚Äôs cards and components.Definitely recommend this for anybody who has a bird enthusiast in their family or gaming group. The game is more complex than Monopoly but not so complex that you couldn‚Äôt teach your mom or ‚Äúcool‚Äù aunt to play it in one sitting.",5.0
385,B07YQ641NQ,R3VB9V6YWOSFL1,like DnD with birds,"  so this game playing by myself, doesn't take long and is fairly easy to learn, playing with 4 players took 2 hours and we didn't even finish the last round. granted 3 ppl were learning how to play it. everything about this game is beautiful but it is a very long intense game. since its turned based waiting for others to go is hard but the benefit of playing with more ppl is their cards that gives everyone bonuses so its worth it. its very pricey for 6ibs of board game! i was hesitant to spend that much but only did because i can play it alone. my husband hates complicated games so i will be playing it alone majority of the time.",4.0
386,B07YQ641NQ,R2ZXTDEK91X44B,Such a gorgous game!,"  Seriously, this is one pretty game! It's been on my wishlist since it was originally announced and I'm glad I finally got it. Compared to other similarly priced board games you get some really nice components and the art is beautiful. Storage is included for most of the pieces, including a box to store the (very large) deck in. Probably one of my favorite little touches is a diagram on the bottom edge of the box that shows you how you can store all of the components neatly in the box.Once you understand how to play it's quite easy to keep up. I'd recommend watching an instructional video instead of using the manual, though, as the instructions can be a little unclear sometimes. A quick 10 minute or so video will give you everything you need to play from start to finish.",5.0
387,B07YQ641NQ,R3DE4DOOZ37PKY,Awesome strategy. Could even be good for kids with mods,"  This is a great game. Lots of possible strategy. Comfortably complex, but can be easily simplified by removing certain elements. I think this could be a really cool game for kids by removing the ""personal whole-game goals"" and the ""round end goals"". It really makes for much simpler strategy that way, with less variable to keep track of.I love the vast number and variety of bird cards (including European expansion). Makes for very different games when cards won't repeat often.The only mechanic no one has really used effectively in our games are the predator powered birds. They are few and far between, and they aren't very powerful.European expansion introduces some really powerful cards, which might be a bit unbalanced, but so far the power cards get distributed pretty evenly giving everyone a fair go.",5.0
388,B07YQ641NQ,R1XFPS8RYVTQX0,Our top family game!! Look forward to seeing the Asian expansion!!,"  We have bought the Wingspan (original + European expansion) for a few days and my family (including our 8-year-old daughter) immediately fall in love with the game. We can't wait to play another game. We love birds and nature. We originally came from Hong Kong and we currently live in California. Due to the shelter-in-place in California, we have bought and played many board games lately and Wingspan is our top game! We look forward to having Asian expansion of the birds in the future for Wingspan. We went for bird-watching frequently when we were in Asia and we do hope to see the inclusion of great birds like Black-faced spoonbills and even some rainforest birds in the future : ) Please let Elizabeth know that we love her game!! Thanks for designing such a beautiful, fun, and educational game : ) My 8-year-old daughter loves it - and she asks us to play it with her everyday : ) Thanks for reading!!",5.0
389,B07YQ641NQ,RP1TWNPZRP8UJ,My husband and I love it!,"  We learned how to play this game from friends who already knew how to play, so when we received our set, we didn't follow the instructions to learn. For us, it was simple to understand, and we got the hang of it quickly. If you are used to complex games like Catan etc., then this is a great game! When we've tried playing with friends and family, it's taken others a bit longer to understand it/they struggle to play.For now, my husband and I challenge each other almost every night, which is a fun changeup from Netflix.Bonus, the illustrations are downright gorgeous.",5.0
390,B07YQ641NQ,RYEQRRDJVZQOJ,THE BIRDS!,"  Can a competitive board game actually be calm, relaxing and rewarding? Yes, and this game helps prove that. With similar elements to PARKS and Azul (both top 10 board games in my opinion), Wingspan has so many different components that make it such a wonderful experience. We got the Swift Start pack which has 10 new cards that are used with 4 easy-to-play starting guides. You can then, seamlessly, put those 10 new cards into the deck.We have only played the 2 player version of the game as it's just me and my girlfriend. There are different modes whether you want people to take 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc for each of the 4 rounds or if you want it to be less competitive and just give points for each round's goal, so both people could earn the max of 5 points.The only ""confusing"" part was understanding that you use an action cube once, so in the first round you have 8 turns, second round 7, third round 6, fourth/final round 5. You place the action cubes on the end of round bonus cards, even if you got 0 points.We can't wait to try this with more people or even a solo game as they bring in other cool things to make that.Finally, the cards and the production quality is impeccable.",5.0
391,B07YQ641NQ,R8TJKWL4Z1FJO,Quality and fun worth every penny.,"  Rules are easy to learn, yet game play is fun every time with many possibilities.  The game just flows.  Learning the rules is in the low moderate difficulty range.  You can learn about many different birds, but you don't have to.  Every turn is not too complex and yet entertaining.  The components are pretty and well designed.  The box is full and does not feel skimmed or cheap, knowing that some other games are actually more than half empty.  I can feel the designer's commitment to details and perfection.  The card tray is big enough for all cards, but not enough if all cards are sleeved.  It's still ok since the goal cards can be put in a ziplock bag and put in the space in the middle of the box; or some cards can be stored in the tray that also comes with the European expansion, which is also a good to have.",5.0
392,B07YQ641NQ,R25BJI0K7XRTVQ,Our new favorite game!,"  We were introduced to this game by my Brother and Sister in law and before our first game had finished we had ordered a copy for ourselves, and my wife's parents also have since ordered it.  This game has replaced Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne as our go to game for game night.  This game is both fun and educational.  I've really been impressed by the quality, craftsmanship, and thought that went into this game.  The instructions and appendix booklets are printed on quality materials and very detailed.  The game itself is an engine building/resource gathering type of game.  Resources being food, eggs, and of course bird cards.  There are so many possible strategies that you can use to maximize points.  Each bird has unique stats, abilities and versatility.  You combine birds in one of three different habitat types to create the resource engine that best suits your strategy.  We love how versatile the game play is and each game is different.  I personally like that the scores are usually fairly close, making each game competitive which keeps all players engaged rather than just losing interest.  Stonemaier has created a great game here and it's no wonder this game has caught on like it has.",5.0
393,B07YQ641NQ,RM6CYXDS25BUZ,SO MUCH FUN!!!,"  This game was given to my husband as a gift (he really liked to birdwatch). I am not a birder and neither is my younger brother, but this game has seriously become our quarantine game. It is so much fun it's like Catan but more complex and with wayyyyy more variety. It has a learning curve that took us about a full game to figure everything out. After the first game, it has been so much fun. I do not know how many times we have played. It's great for two players and more.  I have played several times with just my husband and have had a lot of fun. This game is so great we bought it for the friends that gave it to use as a gift (is that weird?).",5.0
394,B07YQ641NQ,R2RQ781MX4FQRS,Fun Engine-Building Board Game,"  You will build an ""Engine"" out of bird cards that becomes self sustaining as the game goes along. The process is very satisfying as you reach the later rounds. This game is pretty non-confrontational. I recommend this for anyone who is averse to ""take that"" mechanics or plays with people who are. It's a very chill game and the components are extremely nice. The only exception to the component quality is the dice tower shaped like a birdhouse. It's made of cardboard and requires careful handling. But that is a small flaw in an otherwise fun and beautiful game. You can easily find a replacement dice tower on Etsy if the cardboard bothers you.",5.0
395,B07YQ641NQ,RALDJI33PZUUB,Love this game,"  This game is wonderful and so beautiful. The pieces are crafted in such a lovely way and I've learned a lot about the birds include in the pack.  Yes, it's not a simple game, but if you follow the included swift starter pack you will get the hang of it in no time. You could also watch youtube to learn to play. I'd say this game would be best for eager 10 year olds and up but my adult friends and I play it happily again and again. We even experiment by changing up the rules (starting with more food, not counting eggs as points, only drawing from the deck etc.) which keeps it fresh and our strategies changing. Excellent game.",5.0
396,B07YQ641NQ,R2KZBUCM712KQJ,Worth the Hype,"  I heard raving reviews of Wingspan before it even officially launched, and I never really like to preemptively jump on hype trains. I regret not doing that exact thing, because this game is really REALLY a good time. The rules are daunting at first, and I definitely had some glassy-eyed stares from my board game group as I tried to explain the mechanics. As soon as we had our first couple turns down, things clicked, and we were all surprised at how intuitive and stream lined the game is from start to finish. An average game will run you about an hour, give or take 15 minutes depending on how chatty your table is. It's a beast of a game with unique flares that inspire laughs as much as it does intrigue.#Brant4Life",4.0

399,B07YQ641NQ,R2FOEOAMY46P6,Fun!,  Best game ever! I was so happy I could get a copy so quickly since they are sold out almost everywhere. It has depth to it. Unlike many other games You don‚Äôt know who won until the final score. There are so many ways to get points that each game is fresh and new. The cards are beautiful! I took a trip to FL and was able to find some of the birds on my cards so that was fun. The details are well done.this is a game that everyone can enjoy. The only issues is my older friends have trouble reading the small print on the card. There should be a jumbo edition for them. I would also like an expansion pack of birds from Australia.,5.0

It's a thick one, not just cheap like I guessed when looking at the box.2. All 4 tile racks are made of unfinished pine and feel like they need to be sanded once more.3. All 100 tiles were present in their correct amounts per letter. The tiles are made of smooth and finished wood.4.

402,B00IL5XY9K,R2GD8HWRNJB2HZ,"SPECS, AND COMPARING THIS GAME TO SCRABBLE PURCHASED OVER 40 YRS AGO","  I am comparing the Scrabble game by Hasbro Gaming in a bright red box with white ""SCRABBLE"" on front and pictures of lots of letter tiles that I purchased on July 13, 2019 ..... ANDa Scrabble game I purchased over 40 years ago that came in what I consider a purple box, some may call it dark burgundy or dark wine.  My old game has gold lettering on the box, no pictures, and the box is kind of a textured cardboard, not smooth and glossy.COMPARISON:For anyone who just wants the main two differences without reading everything:1.  The new game has a larger board, but the actual playing area of the board is almost the same.The new board has a wider strip down one side to say ""SCRABBLE"" and to tell you how many of each letter there are.  It tells you this on both sides of the border, facing the player who sits on either side.2. The new game has lightweight red plastic racks to hold your letters. My old game has heavy duty wooden racks.  Both WORK fine, but I  prefer wood personally.If you want more exact specs and differences, as well as what HASN'T changed, read on:Old Board measures a tad over 14 1/4  x 14.  The actual playing area is  12 1/4 x 11.New Board measures just shy of 15 1/2  x 14.  The actual playing area is 12 1/2 x 11 1/4.Both boards fold in half.  Mine is still in great condition. Hopefully new board will hold up as well.The backside of the old board is purple (or wine?). The back side of the new board is black.The instructions are printed inside the lid on the old game; on a nice brochure in the new game.The box for the old game measures 14 1/2 x 7 1/2 and is kind of textured heavy duty cardboard.The new game box measures 15 3/4 x 7 1/2 and is a lighter weight standard cardboard game box.The old game tells you only on one end of the board how many of each letter, so it is upside downand hard to see for the person sitting on the opposite side. The new board has it printed on both ends of the wide border, facing in the direction of the person sitting on either side, so it's easy to read for both.The Double Letter, Double Word, Triple Word colored squares on the board are the same on both.The letter tiles are the same size in both and definitely look and feel like wood to me, in both.  There are 98 letters and 2 blanks in both games, and the same number of each letter in both games.  (There are more of commonly used letters such as vowels, especially E and A, and N's and R's.  And only one of letters like J, Q, X and Z, but the same number of each letter in both games.)The really big difference:  the nice wooden racks in the old game vs. the cheap red plastic racks in the new game. Although I greatly prefer the wooden ones, I did not deduct a star for three reasons:  1, people who have never used the old game with wooden racks would probably think nothing of the plastic ones since most games these days have everything plastic everything.  (Had the letter tiles been plastic, I WOULD have deducted a star!)  2, the plastic racks get the job done, no problem. 3, the price of this game, $11.99 when I bought it, is very reasonable for what you get, so it wouldn't be fair to expect the same quality of a game you pay considerably more for.The letters look to me like they are printed in slightly larger, thicker type on the new tiles, which is a GOOD thing.  Still black letters, against very light wood tiles, which is best.The new game came with a black drawstring back, plenty large enough to hold all the letters with ease. My old game did not come with a bag, but I am fine with keeping them on the bottom of the box under the board.I consider this game a good value for the money and I would definitely recommend it, although I would point out to anyone I recommended it to that it has plastic racks, so they aren't disappointed.",5.0
403,B00IL5XY9K,R2LO0N36O1CZV5,JUST DO IT,"  I am 76 years old and had not played Scrabble in many years, but my daughter in Mia ordered one and we played together when I went for a visit.  I beat her.  Has since played with another daughter and a grand-daughter and beat them also.  It is great to keep your mind active and lots of fun also.  Nice to sit and play board games with family and friends rather than each playing a game separately on each one's computer.",5.0
404,B00IL5XY9K,RKO8CKKNM4YBZ,"Functional, but does not hold a candle to the older version.","  I bought this for my family because our old board was split on the crease. The set also had a ""patina"" to it that everyone loved, but I know that it is food and dead skin cells and that is gross as french toast. This version does not replace what we had. The board is a major improvement, since it is not split down the middle. The trays are plastic, which is probably my biggest objection. There are actually four of them, which was news to me as our old set only had three trays with it. The letters are wood, which is good, but they are just printed on and not engraved like the old set. That is probably a good thing because now nobody will spend ten minutes picking his or her letters pretending like they aren't trying to feel for the letter she or he wants. The font is wrong. Also, between the new board and the new tiles, they whole thing is very slippery. So if you breath real hard on the board, the tiles go every which way. I'm used to needing to make adjustments to the letters, but not to this extent. The new board and tiles allow for room between the tiles and that sucks. With the old set, you could lay the tiles touching and they all fit fine. The bag is flimsy, but we have an unopened Crown Royal, so it will be replaced soon. It isn't all bad. The game works, all the pieces were there. I think I will invest in a better version some time in the near future.",3.0
405,B00IL5XY9K,R2DZQTMCMBLH61,Classic in Name Only,"  I ordered this game to use at the monthly ""Secret Headquarters Comics and Games for Everyone Off-Site Game Night"" in Tallahassee.  (Yeah, it's a long name, but now Brian, our Genial Host, owes me one!)  Anyway, I brought Scrabble, mainly because I did not know how to play any of the other games.When we opened it up, I think we were all expecting the look and feel of the ""classic"" Scrabble of our childhoods.  You know, heavy, smooth finished tiles and tile racks and a game board that felt like it could take years of carting around and gaming.This game is sort of a lightweight version.  Everything is there, but it's just feels a bit small and less substantial .  The tiles and racks have minimal finish on them, and the board is thinner.Now, as far as playing, this is a fine set.  However, do not be expecting the original-feeling Scrabble game.  I think if you want the truly ""classic"" set, you have to spend a little more.Why 4 Stars:  The product lives up to its description (if not my nostalgic expectations).  The price is right, and amazon delivered in a timely manner.Problem:  This may be an isolated problem; however, one of the tile racks was missing.  When I alerted amazon to this, as per its usual excellent customer service, it immediately arranged a replacement game to be sent to me. That's another reason for 4 stars--I love good customer service.BTW, I learned to play two new games last Friday:  Flux and Ticket to Ride Europe.  And by ""learned,"" I mean that I lost my shirt.  I will have to see if amazon carries these games, so I can catch up on some of this new-fangled stuff!UPDATE-24 hrs. later: The replacement Scrabble game has arrived, and all 4 tile racks are there!",4.0

430,B083XMTCKP,R2ZFV5D4LIZJNQ,Short Review+ In Depth Review,"  2-6 Players. 45/60mnsIn this game, you get to play one of the 6 Disney Villains: Prince John, Maleficent, Jafar, Ursula, Queen of Hearts, Captain Hook.A 10 year old that is used to board games can probably play without much assitance.The games were fun with 2, 3 and 4 players.We ( 2 adults, 2 teens) have played this multiple times and had a blast.We are Disney fans and we play a lot of board games.Each Villain comes with its own board, its Action Cards, its Fate Cards (which are often used against you) and its marker.Depending on the location of your marker, you get to perform actions. Each board is divided into 4 different areas which will give you different possible actions.. depending on the location of your marker, you get to perform specific actions.The main actions are:Play a card from your handGet a coin/coinsActivate a powerMove an item/Hero to adjacent locationPlay Fate cards on another VillainDiscard your cards.For instance, one location could allow you to : play a card, get two coins, discard your remaining cards, and Play Fate on another Villain. Another location could allow you to play TWO cards, get 1 coin, Activate a Special power, and play fate.You get to mess with other players by playing their Fate cards onto their boards.Each Villain has one goal: defeat Peter Pan, or Capture the Trident, or Spread curses etc...You start with a hand of 4 Action Cards, Some give you Actions to perform, or Ally to Help, or Items.  You start on Location 1,You place your marker on any other location, unless it is locked (cards can be required) depending on what you want to do.You perform at least one action from your location, but can also perform all if you wish.You add your allies and your items on YOUR side of the board, the lower side under each location. You get to choose where you place them. This can only help your Villain.However when other players play Fate Cards on your boards, they also pick a location and place the card on the upper side of your locations thus blocking some of your locations actions.You get to vanquish and fight to achieve your goal.The Disney Theme is cute. It is fun and witty and I am glad they gave special treatment to the artwork.However the game is deeper than it looks, this will take a good 40 minutes.Our first game play took a little over one hour including set up and reading the rules and giggling oohing and aahing at the cards.The game does not come shrink wrapped but taped on the edges. I have not dared to try and remove the tapes. It just looks like bad news.",5.0

I was so excited, and then so very disappointed.  I have only played this two person, but after several plays, the issues I have are not learning curve related and speak to the general execution of the game.  Basically, you are trying to reach your objective and stop the other player from reaching theirs.  What this amounts to is a never ending game, because every time you get close to winning the other player stops you.  Also, while they are taking their turn, you are sitting idly by waiting for your turn or something to happen that affects you.  It ends up being boring and a really long game.  They say it is 50 minutes of play, but the game we just finished was over 3 hours.  My husband basically was ready to let me win just to get it over with.  Maybe it would be better with 3 players.

433,B083XMTCKP,R215V42QQMLAPC,YOU play as a Disney Villain and must complete your heinous schemes to attain your ultimate destiny!,"  Overview‚ÄîYOU play as a Disney Villain and must complete your heinous schemes to attain your ultimate destiny!Disclaimer ‚Äì Skip to the end for the ‚ÄúFinal Thoughts‚Äù to get a snapshot version of this review2- 6 players, CompetitiveLength/Win Condition-This game plays super-fast (for a board game) at about an hour. This time will increase the more players you have but not by much honestly. I played through a few 3 player games and have tested out Ursula, Jafar and Maleficent and can say that turn length doesn‚Äôt take very long as you play from your character board and have just a few actions at your disposal each turn. To win you must complete the ultimate objective for your particular villain. Each of the 6 included villains has a completely different objective which gives the game tons of replayability. Seriously each one couldn‚Äôt be any more different and they are all super fun to play. Here is a short-ish rundown of each villains win objective to give you an idea how different they are:Prince John - Start your turn with 20 powerMaleficent - Start your turn with a curse card at each locationCaptain Hook ‚Äì Defeat Peter Pan at the Jolly RogerQueen of Hearts - Have a Wicket at each location and successfully take a shotJafar - Start your turn with the magic lamp at Sultans palace and Genie under your controlUrsula - You have to start your turn with the Trident and the Crown at Ursula's LairSo I super simplified these as it is much trickier to complete these objectives than it seems. For example it might seem kinda bland to play as Prince John as all you have to do is collect Power‚Ä¶..BUT there are a ton of Fate cards that can be played against you that actually steal his power. There is a nice balance woven into every villain so they can all be played and not one seems more lopsided than the other. Although I can attest that certain Villains *cough*  Jafar  *weez* are much more dependent on their card draws.Components ‚ÄìThey really did a nice job on this one. The game comes with 6 unique plastic tokens that are made up of a softer almost translucent colored plastic that matches your character. Each one looks different and is a really nice touch to the game to make it more thematic. The player boards have a nice velvety feel to them and are made up of a thicker cardboard. They fold in half so they fit in the box better but they really used this to further the theme of the game by adding a quote from that particular villain to one side.  The card stock itself isn‚Äôt the thickest but man these cards look nice. The cards are pretty slick so you might get an instance of cards sliding off the top of the stack. The colorful backs of each villain‚Äôs cards are glorious and the unique designs they incorporated are great. I also love the white color of the Fate decks as well and how they really contrast with the villains decks.  There are little cardboard tokens that are used for tracking power and these are pretty average, nothing special. The one thing component wise that is lacking out of everything is the cauldron that is used to hold the power tokens. A few pictures I have seen online of this it looks really cool, a thicker painted more epic looking holder. The one it comes with though is a flat gray VERY thin plastic holder. I mean it gets the job done and the game didn‚Äôt NEED to come with anything to hold all those power tokens so I appreciate it but as far as components go, it is pretty lacking.Box/Storage ‚ÄìThe box has that same velvety feel to it that the player boards have and it feels VERY premium. I love the colors on the box and the font they used as well as the gold foil inlays around the edge. However it seems they opted to place 4 round clear stickers on each edge to keep the box shut instead of the usual plastic wrap you find on board games. Now for me this wasn‚Äôt a huge problem as you can easily slice through these stickers and leave them affixed. However if you are a serious collector you will probably want to remove these and they leave a really messy sticky residue behind. Also be aware that when removing the sticker it will more than likely pull some of that fancy looking gold inlay away as well. There is a cardboard insert that separates the cards into 2 different piles and a space for all the other components and it seems to hold everything in place well for good storage.Visual Appeal ‚ÄìVisually this is one of the better looking ones and the writing on the cards is superb! With artwork directly from the Disney cartoons everything is extremely authentic and colorful. The theme from each of the cartoons just oozes forth when you play as each villain. Heck even their win objectives are thematic and interesting. One particular card that I discovered from Captain Hooks Fate deck really stood out to me with some incredible wordplay (I posted a picture of it with this review).Rulebook ‚ÄìFor the most part the rulebook gets the job done explaining the basic gameplay mechanics. Plus there are individual mini rulebooks for each villain that more closely explains each of their wind conditions and explaining in a bit more detail what they need to do. These are super handy as you can keep them close at hand at all times to reference and they take up very little table space. Also included are 6 reference cards that explain what each symbol means on the player boards. I would say it should take you no more than 20 minutes to really grasp how to play the game and maybe 5 more minutes to learn your character.Table Presence/Game Board ‚ÄìThis game takes up VERY little space on the table as you just have your individual game boards in front of you and space on each side for your villain deck and your fate deck. A little bit of space above and below your player board to place cards. In the middle of the table would sit the plastic cauldron with all the power tokens for everyone to reach, and that‚Äôs it! Now normally I would think a game with so little to bring to the table wouldn‚Äôt have great table presence but this game looks really cool, especially with more players. Each colorful player board has their villain specific player token standing atop it looking all awesome. Also the colorful backs of each different villain deck and the unique designs they each have are eye candy to the extreme.Table Talk/Fun Factor ‚ÄìThis game creates a bookoo of table talk as you are not only trying to achieve your evil schemes but are having to keep an eye out for the other villains to try and thwart their schemes. To do this you can choose to use the action to draw 2 cards from their fate deck and use one against them. The fate decks consist of those particular villains‚Äô heroes from the movies and other actions that will basically hinder their plans. It creates a clever dynamic and never makes it easy for the villain. And honestly I had a blast playing this. There is so much variety to each villain that each game plays a bit different but I am already looking forward to the (probable) expansion with new villains to play.Optimal Player Count ‚ÄìI have only played with 3 and had a ton of fun. I think a 2 player game would be a little too fast for my taste considering 3 players only lasts about an hour. I am really interested in playing a full 6 player game to see how that would play out as I think it would be really fun to get all 6 villains and their objectives on the table at the same time. The ultimate showdown. There isn‚Äôt a single player option however you can easily play 2 or more villains yourself to learn the game. Of course some of the villain cards drawn and some abilities are meant to be used with multiple playersFinal Thoughts ‚ÄìLove it. Absolutely love this one. From the color to the artwork to the clever writing on the cards. The majority of the components are nice and the box feels premium. The game is easily taught although I wouldn‚Äôt expect younger children to fully grasp some of the intricacies of some of the villains. As far as theme goes this game is ranked super high as it should be with Disney. The only negatives I can think of would be the questionable stickers they used to seal the box and the cheap plastic power token holder. As the game has this really premium feel those 2 things left me slightly puzzled. For the price this is a must buy.",5.0
434,B083XMTCKP,R11QFM4MSR7U02,Another Great Expansion,"  These three villains each have very unique gameplay, with additional cardboard pieces not seen in any of the other sets. This makes for fun changes, though I do wonder if these new expansions are starting to become so complex and evolved that they are no longer fairly matched with the original characters.As you'll see in the detailed review below, each of the characters have multi-layered objectives (do this, so that you can do this, and then you can win). This is fun for us as experienced players, but it's not a fair match to pair these characters with early villains like Prince John (collect 20 power) or Maleficent (a curse at each location). That said, these expansion characters are great to use against some of the newer characters, and even some of the older challenging ones like Ursula.Details for frequent players:CRUELLA: She is definitely the most challenging of the three. Her objective is to capture puppy tokens, but she only has two allies, and these allies need to be activated in order to capture any of them. The problem is that the two activate spots on the board are on the top row, so they can both be covered by fate cards and really slow you down. Playing her against Hades (which we've found to be the most difficult villain so far) proved to be a fair, and very LONG, matchup.PETE: He's the one that changes up the gameplay more than any villain to date. Instead of completing one objective, he has to complete four mini-objectives that are placed at each location. Some of these are relatively easy; some can be very hard, especially if you're targeted by a fate action. His deck comes with TONS of allies, which is helpful for certain objectives, but it does make his deck full of repeat cards. He might be the most fun to play with of these three though, because he has lots of routes to victory.MOTHER GOTHEL: Her objective is the most straightforward‚Äîcollect ""trust"" (represented as power tokens from the supply) by playing cards at strategic times. Rapunzel is a permanent hero in her realm, constantly moving back and forth. If you've blocked your opponent's ability to play fate actions on you every turn, then Mother Gothel is pretty easy to win with. But if your opponent(s) can strike you with a fate action every turn, it's almost impossible to collect and keep the necessary ""trust."" Be warned.Overall, this game continues to be a favorite! Of the expansions, I'd rank them (1) Wicked to The Core, (2) Perfectly Wretched, (3) Evil Comes Prepared.Enjoy playing!",5.0
435,B083XMTCKP,R29RNAPSHXB2AS,BUYER BEWARE - Not Suitable for Children,"  ""Well, well...""I wanted to love this game, but I just can't. Very poor gameplay design really lets this game down. It has quality components (except for the cauldron), and a fantastic theme/setting, but the gameplay is slow and laborious.The game says that it takes 50 minutes to play - it lies (""OFF WITH THEIR HEADS"")!Every game I have played has taken in excess of two hours (with 3+ experienced board gamers for each game). This game doesn't have the complexity nor strategy to justify being a two hour game, and it's way too long for kids. Terraforming Mars is a two hour game, Villainous needs to be 30-45 mins tops - especially if it wants to promote itself as a game for ten+ year olds.I'm not sure what the developers were aiming for with this game. If they wanted to just cash in on Disney nostalgia and milk people for money then this game will do that (TAXES! Beautiful, lovely, TAXES!). If they wanted to create a fun experience where players get to sink their teeth into Disney villainy, then I don't believe that they've succeeded.BUYER BEWARE. ""Pour Unfortunate Souls, in pain... in need..."" can get better games than this!Colt Express, Dixit, Codenames Pictures, Hare and the Tortoise, and Azul are all around the same price as this and are much, much better games for adults and kids alike.",1.0

438,B083XMTCKP,R1JT2BABYWHOFD,Excellent first impression for a group of regular gamers.,"  I received this game yesterday and couldn't wait to play a game. I played a game with my wife, sister, and bro-in-law; we played as Cptn Hook, The Queen of Hearts, Prince John, and Milleficent. I agree that there is a definite learning curve, especially with the first game, but I don't feel like it is quite as steep as others have described, but we do regularly play fairly heavy games. We each felt like halfway thru the first game we had the gist of things.We each commented in the middle of the game how much we were enjoying the game, and when the game ended, the other three players would have won on the following turn, so it was definitely a close game.I have the feeling that this will be a winner at my house for quite some time. Easily 9/10, The only reason I don't give it a perfect ten is because I haven't seen Jafar or Ursula played yet. Will update this review as necessary.",5.0
439,B083XMTCKP,R1M4Y5P4ZRQ4S2,Great Game! Horrible shipping!,"  This is more a review of the shipping experience. I really do love this product and was so excited when it was released. Then the box arrived I was extremely disappointed to discover the shipping label was adhered to the game box ruining the box. I couldn't be more displeased with the shipping experience. However I really do want to give the product 5 stars, I own all the others and was excited to add this to my collection.",1.0
440,B083XMTCKP,R1DFRSP57D76OF,Quickly became one of my favorite board games,"  I love board games, particularly more adventurous and more adult ones, but getting my wife to play them with me is like pulling teeth. This one is very easy to learn but a challenge to master, which makes it accessible for those who are casual board gamers but enjoyable for the more ""hardcore"" enthusiast. Each playthrough is different depending on what characters each player chooses, the strategy they apply, and the random draw of the cards. Can't wait until they release expansions with new villians.",5.0
441,B083XMTCKP,RCLDNNWCWP4BB,Good Disney Fun!,"  I admittedly was drawn to this game because I love Disney, and who doesn't secretly root for the villains every now and then. But after playing this a few times, I can say that I really enjoy it! Each player chooses one of 6 villains from across the Disney spectrum, each with a unique card deck, win condition, realm board and strategy. However, there is a lot of balance to the game, where no character feels over powered or a ""sure-win"". I thought it was very cool that Ursula played completely different than Prince John, even though the components were the same.The art is gorgeous, I love how each villain has a unique win condition, and most games were very close. There is a bit of a learning curve with new players, and the second playthrough is always more enjoyable than the first. Also the component pieces of the game feel a little cheap, but the game is almost half the price of a traditional big real ease. If you love board games and Disney, this is a no brainer. But even if you are not a fan of Disney there is still a lot to enjoy. Highly recommend!",5.0
442,B083XMTCKP,RC3LABGZ3THCL,Not for 12 and under!!!,  Game said recommended for 10 years of age.Purchased for my 10 year old and it is far too complicated for us to play without assisting him SIGNIFICANTLY.Do not recommend for anyone under teenage years.,1.0
443,B083XMTCKP,R15908KG9P1TTL,"Crap shipping, but great expansion.",  The game itself is great. I was highly disappointed in the shipping. They didn't put the game in a box. They simply slapped a shipping label to the outside of the game box and it got crushed while shipping. Whoever made the decision that that was an okay method of shipping should be let go as they weren't doing their job. ...

444,B083XMTCKP,RX6Q05K1NKGN8,The TRUE review for adult-only game nights!,"  I read a LOT of reviews on this game, and there seems to be two different camps; people either love it or find it incredibly difficult to learn.  This review will be from a group of 25-35 year old disney fanatic folks, some who tablet top game, some who board game, and some who do neither and are totally new to all concepts.  With that being said, I will agree that there is a learning curve. HOWEVER - I did not find it as difficult as so many reviews state. After one full go aronud, you will pick this game up no problem, as long as you really sit with the rules utilize the ability card. I do NOT recommend this game for anyone younger than high school age, as there is a lot of strategy that is needed to play this game to its fullest. With that being said, once you get a good idea of how the game works, it is a TON of fun!  You can definitely play this with just two people, but playing with 5 or 6 is just so much more fun! I am REALLY hoping they release expansions with more villains, because after having this game for just two weeks, we played it NONSTOP, almost every night, and we are all familiar with all the great strategies to win with each villain! Wonderforge, PLEASE RELEASE MORE VILLAINS!! Love this game so much!",5.0
445,B083XMTCKP,REQNW9FG0WJOO,We are obssessed with this game!,  We have the original Villianous and the other expansion pack! We love this expansion!

446,B083XMTCKP,R2D4GBJ4YGD25N,I am a bit obsessed with this game. Highly recommend.,"  I made my fiance play this 5 times in two days just so we could see how all of the characters work in game play. Each player chooses a villain and each villain has a different objective than the others. The goal of each player is to reach your villains objective before the other player reaches theirs.This took about 2 hours to learn properly. I say that, because this could easily become one of those ""monopoly type"" games where each household has their own rules, simply because they didn't feel like figuring out how to play as the game creators intended. If you get this, be sure to put in the time to figure out all of the rules and little details that make the game what it is. It will be worth it!After we learned how to play, each game takes 30 min- 1 hour depending on what character you choose to play as. Some are much more in depth than others, making it a bit harder.I would not recommend this for children under 12 unless you are ok with making up simpler rules for your household. The game also includes a link to a website that lets you vote on who the next villains available will be. hinting at expansion packs. I really really hope they come out with the expansions soon!",5.0

448,B083XMTCKP,R2EDXH4N3PB9S5,Easy to learn and play and good for the whole family,"  We received this game this past Tuesday and have spent a couple evenings learning the game and playing with my family of 5 (youngest if 8 years old and understood the rules just fine).  The game was well packaged and the cards and game boards are beautiful.  The rules are easy to learn after a couple rounds, but the main thing to understand is that each villain has different goals for the game and you need to be aiming towards that while also watching that others are not close to winning.  We have had a great time playing through several of the villains and some of the fate cards that come up (cards that prevent a villain from doing things).  Overall, a fun card based turn game that is good for the family and it's about Disney villains, so what's not to love!",5.0

The game takes too long to actually figure out and there is too much going on to really keep interest in it. I found myself wishing someone would figure out how to win in order to end the game and be done with it. Somehow you have to care about what you are doing as well as everyone else when everyone seems to be playing a different game at the same time.

From this box I mostly play as Scar, that‚Äôs easily my favorite deck to play. My husband alternates between the other two.

I also really like that you can mix and match boxes with characters.",5.0
451,B083XMTCKP,R1BJ6WUGSRSPKK,Fun for Disney fans. Takes a while to learn.,  The game was enjoyable when you have at least 4 people playing. It can become really competitive because of all the sabotage which is fun for some people.

453,B083XMTCKP,R2D9Y5FH6CBA1K,Not bad.,"  The directions can be a bit confusing. For me I think that I just think too in depth for this game. It is vague on some things leaving unanswered questions on what you can and can't do, however, we settled on if the card doesn't say it then it is what it is. Stop asking all the extra questions. It was not as lengthy as I thought it would be. Our first go at the game I was Maleficent and my friend Ursula. We ended the game quicker than I would have thought, still not sure if we played completely correctly but I suppose we were close enough.All in all after not over thinking the directions we did enjoy the game. I will include my kids on the next go around to make things more interesting. I suppose the results of the game are as expected. It is nice quality as far as figures, boards, and cards go. I'd say it could be a little less pricey but being Disney you expect higher prices anyway. I give the game 4 stars despite the learning curves to the game.",4.0
454,B083XMTCKP,RP4D8AU70NRWF,Beautifully Made! But Too Much Like A Solo Game,"  I ordered the 'Evil Comes Prepared' version with Scar, Ratigan, and Yzma. I wanted to play a few rounds of this game before I wrote a review, just so I could be sure that I understood all the rules before I gave my thoughts. I was SO excited to get this, and figured it would be a great way to pass the time during lockdown. While it is a beautifully crafted game, and the artwork and pieces are super pretty...I'm overall disappointed with it.I played with my roommate, and it felt like we were both stumbling through the rules for our individual characters and not actually playing a game together. Since each player is going on their own Villain quest, I really had no idea what was going on with her, nor she with me, since each character has so many quirks and special abilities/goals. We both felt like we were just using each turn to very slowly go through our decks to find the 'big item' we needed to actually move the game forward. I played my first game as Scar and my second as Ratigan, and both of them require you to find a certain card in one of your decks before you can actually make any real progress in the game.Once we actually did start truly playing, the winning felt a bit anticlimactic. You have limited ways to 'interact' with each other's characters through the fate decks, but¬†really it's either a major start-all-over moment or nothing, so it didn't feel very involved when one of us won. If just felt like luck of who drew their 'important' card faster.I'm a big board game fan, but I just overall wasn't not super impressed with this one. Again, it's beautifully made, which is why it still gets 3 stars! But just not something I feel the need to play again anytime soon. Glad I got this one before the big main boxed set.",3.0

456,B083XMTCKP,R1JUM3T1BL94GU,Very expensive but beautiful,"  The packaging, the design, and tactile feel, everything is beautiful and excellent about this expansion.

457,B083XMTCKP,R1B12LLBBDV1OJ,For those already familiar with the original Villainous....,"  I'm not good at explaining game dynamics or how to play, but for those of you already familiar with the original game (the largest set with Maleficent, Captain Hook, Prince John, Ursula, Queen of Hearts, and Jafar) this is definitely a fun and worthy addition!! (And yes, you can play with this pack alone--- it's just really fun to have more characters!) Hades is either my favorite or second favorite character in the whole series. I love this game because it's really well done (very thought out, detail-rich, true to characters), and because you're not just playing to beat other players. You're focusing on your own unique objective, and I very much enjoy that aspect. It is a strategy game for sure, so it can take a few tries to remember everything for a character while also making the most advantageous moves. I've only played against Dr. Facilier, but I got annoyed because I feel like he's hard to really ""harm"" in the game until he gets to the step just before he wins. His Fate cards are wimpy in my opinion. My husband loves playing him cause he kept winning! lol I did give it 4 out of 5 stars for ""Value for money"" only because the larger, original game is the same price if not cheaper! Still worth it, I just find that strange--- even the other expansion is almost $10 cheaper on here.",5.0
458,B083XMTCKP,R325EW36FV799Z,Introduction to asymmetry,"  This was my very first board game when I decided to get into the hobby and it's mostly because of the theme. Disney villains are known to all ages and groups and go over well when you ask your friend group to play a game. Everyone starts picking who they enjoy, who they identify with, and start reading through their pamphlet.Some characters are more complicated than others and this is where multiple playthroughs are helpful. At first you're going to wonder how anyone at all can win this game as anyone besides Prince John who has the simple task of accruing wealth.Then after a couple of playthroughs with the same character things will start to click for you and your friends. You'll develop favorites and tactics for your main character.Something not usually important in asymmetrical games, at least I'm often told this, that what your opponent is doing doesn't matter and that is so far from the truth in this game. In two turns someone can be ready to complete their goal and understanding their goal could mean the difference when casting fate on their land in order to hinder their progress.All in all it's a fun game, easy to learn, and there are plenty of Youtube videos to help you out if you're unsure of how things work.",5.0
459,B083XMTCKP,R1ARKSRMI2K4DK,"Good game, poor packaging","  UPDATE: The new, second printing has improved the box texture and added a nice, plastic insert to hold everything. Unfortunately, it's still sealed with tape instead of shrink wrap. Increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars for these fixes.I had to chance to play two sessions last night, and enjoyed the game. However, the packaging on the first printing is TERRIBLE. The game box has some odd ""soft touch"" finish which makes it difficult to open the lid and attracts dust and pet fur. The game also arrived damaged since Wonder Forge couldn't be bothered to shrink wrap the game, and Amazon's pictures didn't include any packing material in the shipping box.On top of that, the insert is also cheap, folded cardboard that was mangled, causing all of the pieces to slide around before I even opened the game. I am not happy with 1st edition.  On a positive note, the second printing removes the soft-touch material and includes a proper, shaped insert. That version has been out for 3 months now,. so I'm really surprised that Amazon is still pushing version 1.0.The game play itself is quite good, with simplified worker placement and an elegant, asymmetric set of abilities for each villain. So kudos for that, and the lovely artwork. But C- for packaging.",4.0
460,B06XYLL66Y,R4O6GBJO9IHCB,Great Version for Young Kids,"  This is a great version for younger kids.  I bought this as as Christmas gift for my two younger sons, ages 7 and 5.  They play easily (and their older brothers--9 & 11 enjoyed it too).  Every time a player lands on a space, he/she must either: (1) purchase it if it's available; or (2) pay rent if someone else has already purchased it.  This really speeds up the game.  The money is also just $1.00/1.00 monopoly increments.  So the counting and purchasing is very straightforward.

(They can choose which token to use, and some of the Chance cards involve a decision. But they must always buy property they land on, there are no houses so nothing to decide there.)

My 15 year old enjoys playing it with her little brother as well.I was worried it would be too complex, but I was surprised that it was simplified enough for a young (4-8ish) crowd. It is made simple by only having $1 bills and using tokens as the houses. You also must buy each property you land on, so little kids don't have to worry about complex strategy.The game is simplified enough for littles, but still fun enough for adults to be able to play.

There's absolutely no agency on the part of the players to modify the course of the game (other than rolling the die). Other than that, it's completely autopilot.

470,B06XYLL66Y,R31FWH24BZO5UN,Great intro to Monopoly with perfect difficulty level for kids! More luck than strategy based.,"  I love Monopoly and was curious how the Jr. version was going to appeal to the kiddos. The action is similar to the regular version: you go around the board collecting properties and charge a fee when an opponent lands on your property (and vice versa).In the kid-friendly Jr. version, you automatically buy the unoccupied properties you land on and, instead of buying homes and then hotels, you make a single payment to claim the spot (by placing a cute picture of your game piece at the top). This takes out the strategy part of the decision-making and makes the process less stress-inducing (insert flash-back to an intense regular Monopoly game-night experiences : ). Also, the spaces get a kid-friendly make-over. Think Movie Theatre, PIzza Shop, Library, etc... Not to worry, Boardwalk and Park Place are still there.There is some strategy involved, but it's mostly luck. For example, the chance cards direct you to a color square vs. specific location (eg.: instead of ""Go to the Movie Theatre"" it would say ""Go to a purple space""). The player than decides which purple space to land on. Either that or we've misunderstood the rules :).Overall, the kids love to play it (both under 10).  Of course, there is still a few dramatic ""I wanted that one"" moments, but overall, 5 stars. Can't wait to play the real thing in a few years!",5.0

472,B06XYLL66Y,R18G6ZUTKUXP9B,Changes between the games.,"  I got this to add to a collection of Monopoly board games I own. I thought this would be a good idea to have around the house as the full game is a bit to complicated for when my young niece & nephews come over.Personally, I thought the quality of the tokens where a large improvment over the color coded cars from the edition I had as a child & the board is as solid as my full copy's of the game.I will note that this edition of Monopoly Jr. is different from the classic Monopoly Jr. I had as a kid but I feel the changes are done in a way so moving into the full game makes more sence as you get older & try out the full game.For example, in classic Monopoly Jr. Train stations where roll again spaces but in this edition there fully removed. This is good because in the full game of Monopoly the train stations are propertys to buy so I could see this being jarring to a kid going from Classic Monopoly Jr. to the full game & learning these are not roll again spaces. Where as going from this edition to the full game the space is going to be completely new & will be way less confusing to kids graduating into the full game.My favorite change is the removal of uncle Penny's lose change in favor of the classic free parking also found in the full game. I have been told Hasbro gets thousands of calls every year over free parking because far to many people think a common house rule where you can collect money on free parking is official & are often confused when they can't find rules regarding free parking in the book only to be told by Hasbro that nothing happens there. Uncle Penny's loose change actually made the common money collecting house rule official in the Jr. Edition. Uncle Penny's loose change only helped fuel already in place misconceptions about free parking & how the space is supposed to works so removing it will hopefully help kill common misconceptions about the game with future generations.I don't know how I feel about all the money being $1.00 bills in the modern edition. In the classic edition you had $1, $2, $3,$4, & $5 bills. Perhaps this was done to simplify the game? Especially as we don't actually have $3 & $4 bills in real money & the values are different in full classic Monopoly ($1,$5,$10, $20,$50, $100, & $500) If you feel your kids need bills other then just $1.00 bills or want more $ in the game, you might want to consider adding a toy/monopoly money to your order.In conclusion, I feel this is a really great starting point for teaching kids how to play Monopoly & is a big improvement over it's classic counterpart as the game is changed in ways that make going from the Jr. Edition to the full version far easier then it used to be & I cannot recomend it enough for that.",5.0
473,B06XYLL66Y,R9PKMQSEHQ69C,Good game for the kids,"  Ok so 2 things - the good. This ‚Äúmy first monopoly‚Äù is decent enough that my 5 yr old granddaughter had a good time with memaw and pepaw. The drawback is it can end in no time at all. When you deal the money, you get $18 to start (property ranges from $1 - $5 each), so you can run out of money quickly if you‚Äôre paying everyone rent. With only 3 of us playing, we may dole out a couple of dollars extra next time to lengthen the game.The not-so-good. Why is it that every board game we‚Äôve received lately has the box bent, crushed, punctured, or missing a piece? The box was slightly crushed on this one but doesn‚Äôt affect the game. 4 stars for handling of the product. Other than that it‚Äôs a good beginners game.",4.0

477,B06XYLL66Y,R211L0T6B7Y2MH,Good introduction,  This game is a good introduction to monopoly. My daughters are 8 and 10 and personally I think it's too easy for them. The downfall of this game is there is no critical thinking needed. You literally just do what it tells you. You don't get the opportunity to decide if you want to buy a property or not. Once your kids know how to count and follow directions it's incredibly easy. My girls are still entertained by it though.  I wish they had a another version.

490,B077MZ2MPW,RDSB4MG423L01,"Easy to learn with good strategy elements, 2-4 players!","  Within the past year I got into board games and over this year I have acquired a decent collection and have played a variety of games in terms of themes and difficulty. I'm pretty hooked! When Azul won the Spiel des Jahres in 2018 I ""had"" to buy it. I wanted to get in on a hot new game to understand why it's well revered. Since buying it I've played about 12 games, mostly 2 players, but a few 4 player games and it's a blast.The game revolves around picking up tiles and placing them to score points, that is the most simplistic explanation. The game start off slowly without much tension, but as your board fills up the game becomes pretty cutthroat as you try to force your opponent to take tiles that will cause them to lose points while mitigating the point loss on your own board. It requires thinking ahead and critical thinking. It's a fantastic board game that takes 1 round to teach, and many rounds to develop a strategy.There are Youtube videos to learn the game easily, don't be hesitant if you're looking for pretty game that is suitable for the family that will help keep your brain sharp. Azul is well worth the price.My only issue with Azul is that there are some beautiful tile designs on the board game cover that are not available in the game. The plain red and blue tiles would benefit from having some beautiful designs like the cover indicates. Otherwise, I have no caveats with this game. The components are nice to hold and look at, and the game is fun to play.",5.0
491,B077MZ2MPW,R1K92SN63XVQAL,Very Disappointed in Quality and Customer Service,"  Having played Azul with friends, we decided to buy it because it was so much fun.We were really disappointed when we received Azul the first time because because the player boards were all ripped along the edges, and all the pieces felt like very cheap plastic, especially compared to when we played the game before with friends.So we returned and exchanged the game. The new game arrived today and again the player boards are ripped around the edges, the box was crushed a little on the side, and very cheap pieces. Some of the symbols were printed off-center on the small square pieces. We are not happy to get the same game twice in a row with cheap pieces and poor quality.I contacted Amazon customer service, and they weren't willing to give us any type of refund on the game, unless I returned again. It's annoying to keep going back and forth to the post office to return items. The pictures speak for themselves. No one wants a new item to be delivered damaged twice in a row.The gameplay is great. I really recommend it, but I'm very disappointed in the quality of the 2 games we bought, and how poor customer service has been in working with us.",2.0
492,B077MZ2MPW,R3EA317DNHQ9S4,Poor customer support - 6-month delay on replacing defective parts,"  This is a revised review. I wrote the below review soon after purchasing the game. It took the company 6 months to replace the defective parts, but better late than never.The game itself seems good. However, the copy I received was defective in a couple ways:1) The game comes with a cloth bag for putting in tiles. The bag came with a rip2) The game comes with 4 ""player boards"". They must produce them in sheets with multiple boards per sheet, and then someone ""tears"" them apart. In this process, two of our boards had their edges torn. It doesn't affect playability, but it does impact aesthetics.I expect a game company to stand by its products and send replacements. I contacted the company online a week ago and have received absolutely no response. I sent them another email and received no response. At minimum, I expect a company to respond to communications.",3.0
493,B077MZ2MPW,R28JRG9BHCRKJ2,it looked like fun and I decided to buy,"  I recently bought this game after having seen an article stating the game had won a ""game of the year"" honor.  After looking into it, it looked like fun and I decided to buy.  Sure enough, the honor is worth it.  My wife and I really enjoy the game.  We tried it out for the first time this weekend, just the two of us.  After playing a few rounds, thinking we would call it a night, we kept deciding to play ""just one more game"".The setup is very simple.  The rules are overall easy, but they can be just a little confusing at first when you're trying to figure out the point of the game.  After watching a couple of ""how to play"" videos on YouTube, we got it and off we went.  When you play, the first few rounds seem pretty simple.  But as you get further in the game, the gameplay really tightens up and you have to think of the best way to move forward.  Do you go for extra points?  Or do you try to block your opponents from getting theirs?  It's both simple in design, and a little complex in strategy.  Love that!The build quality of the game is pretty high. Each player gets their own game board that is nice and solid/stiff.  The ""store"" disks are fairly sturdy and remind you of cardboard coasters (these would be the least sturdy of the whole set).  The tiles are very sturdy and well made.  And the tile bag is nice and thick fabric.  Overall, it's a very attractive and well executed design.I can see us enjoying this game for many years.  I'm looking forward to my next round.",5.0
494,B077MZ2MPW,RDP2W1J6T8YNJ,Highly Recommended,"  We're really enjoying this game requiring different thinking/playing than most of our other games.  Aesthetically, we wish the 2 plain kinds of tiles had been given a design like the other 3 kinds, but this is a great game.  We bought a second drawstring bag to put tiles in after play, and that helps with a more smooth flow of the game.  We also enjoy playing ""blind"" sometimes by shielding our boards from view - especially when playing with only two people.",5.0

There are tactical nuances that you only discover as you play and as players become more sophisticated in their strategy. There is much to compromise or risk with choices, depending on what other players are doing. It is an engaging game that lasts a short time and the visual design is beautiful.

500,B077MZ2MPW,ROSZV1ZNJIHL4,BUY THIS GAME!,"  Great Gift for family, friends or yourself. Teaches Strategic Thinking on many levels.The game involves using tile to cover your wall. As with most great games on the surface it is easy enough for kids 10+ to play, the more you play the more you learn there are multiple strategies. After a few rounds, you learn that it is not best to be the first to ""win"" by completing a row to end the game. You actually get more points by having all of the tiles of a color or completing a column.  You need to watch your board and the other players board to devise your completing a row strategy.After two rounds, the  kids were able to hold their own with a few strategic hints.The more you play, the more you learn to play smart rather than fast. Once you tackle the strategies you can take the game to a whole new level by flipping the game board over and play the blank wall  option.  The game boards are thick, substantial cardboard and the tiles are colorful, thick, plastic pieces.  This is not a game you will play a few times and get bored with. I see there is an expansion kit of Joker tiles, which will add a whole new curve ball to the game.  I hope to add that to my collection soon.",5.0

As we continued to open we see the packages also seem quite disheveled and one of the red tiles is outside the bag of red tiles. All seeming random only after we counted the red tiles it was clearly an extra. Then we come to realize that the starting player tile is completely missing from the package. At this point it is all clear that this game isn't in new condition and likely had been played, repackaged without all the extra parts.

I've introduced a half dozen groups to it (who are disappointed that it is currently only available at 3 times the normal price from scalpers).

504,B077MZ2MPW,R2ZW22F7AWDHYM,Awesome family favorite,"  This might have turned into my family‚Äôs favorite game.  We have a bunch and some really good ones.  It‚Äôs a little too much for my 7-yo son, but my 9-yo daughter loves it, as does my 10-yo and me and my wife.  We got four games for Christmas and we have played this easily ten times this week.  Today I played this game four times back to back.My only issue was a rule that did not seem to be practically explained.  I looked up what people were saying about this rule on BGG and found that it was explained there well.  For all intensive purposes, when you draft tiles, you go around the players and draft until they are ALL taken during each round.  We mistakenly thought that you only drafted once around the table, and that was a round.  Once we got the rules right, I was thankful because this is really a good strategy/puzzle game.  Spiel des Jahres winner is totally justified.",5.0
505,B077MZ2MPW,R3W1DKAFH55UC1,After playing once I know this game is a winner.,"  First off, we have no missing pieces and no quality issues with any game materials. Everything is in good condition and looks nice.My wife and I both immediately thought of ""Coloretto"" when we started playing. But it is like Coloretto on steroids, with practically an entire additional dimension to it. Once you start playing, the instructions seem relatively simple, but you will soon realize how many things need to be considered to optimize scoring. And we only did a two-player game -- with 3 or 4 players the game would get even more intricate, depending on how many people are willing to play in a more cutthroat fashion.As with any game of this style you can decide to play to build yourself up or to try to bring your opponent(s) down. Additionally, it is the type of game you don't need to worry about having one ""bad"" round early on, because fortunes can change pretty quickly. Frankly, I am a poor sport. But a game like this makes me not care so much about losing because you can remain competitive despite mis-steps here and there (other games are not so forgiving, and tend to make me want to give up).I do think the ""Ages 8 and up"" may be a bit aggressive, but maybe that is only because we have an 8 year old who is a bad sport like her dad, and isn't as easy-going about those special few games where the joy of playing overrides the outcome -- she still just wants to win.  *smile*  I do think an average eight-year-old could get the hang of it after a few plays, through.",5.0
506,B077MZ2MPW,R3Q13HAAUMO8D1,This game is FANTASTIC!,"  Wow. This game is FANTASTIC! My family plays a lot of board games. This hits the table more than any game I have owned. I bought it for my mom and she is addicted too. It has been played by ages 8-60 and we all love it. I watched a video on YouTube before purchasing and thought it looked so-so, but once I played it I couldn't stop!This is an abstract game. Essentially you draw tiles with an interesting drafting system and place them in rows on your board. The rows have room for 1-5 tiles of one color and when all tiles have been drafted you score the completed rows. You score more for tiles that connect (like Scrabble) and cannot place same colors in rows or columns (like Sudoku).It's simple but there are so many decisions to make! There is a lot of luck in which tiles appear in a round but you can employ different strategies based on available tiles and the number of players.The game is beautiful and the tiles are just amazing! They have a good, solid feel and look stunning on the board. Maybe that adds to the addiction?I prefer this to similar games: Sagrada and Reef. AZUL is a bit easier, but the game play goes faster and seems more satisfying at the end of the day.",5.0
507,B077MZ2MPW,R1VYJLH3LF1VQC,Beginners and Veteran gamers alike can have a good time together playing,"  Azul is a 2 to 4 player tile laying game. The game ends after a row is completed, and the player with the most victory points wins the game.For a four player Setup, each player will receive a player board with scoring cube. Nine circle disks called ""factory displays"" will be placed in a circle at the center of the table. On each disk there will be four randomly drawn tiles from the tile bag.GameplayFactory Offer: A player will need to choose a set of same colored tiles from either a ""factory display"" or the center table area of the nine disks. When tiles are chosen from the ""factory display"" the tiles that remain will move to the center table area. When choosing tiles from the center table area, if the player is the first to do this, they will gather a set of one tile type and obtain the first player marker, and go first in the next round. After choosing tiles, players will place their chosen tile/s on their player board in one of the five pattern lines. These pattern lines range from one square to five squares. All tiles must be placed on the same pattern line as players are not allowed to split up their tiles. Any tiles that cannot be place are moved to the Floor Line that gives the player negative victory points for each wasted tile. After all tiles have been chosen this phase will end.Wall-tiling: All players may do this at the same time, players will now move finished Pattern Lines to their respective Wall areas on their player board. Players will start with the One Pattern Line and end on the Fifth Pattern Line. Players will discard excess tiles of completed rows as only one tile is moved. Scoring will be one point for placing a single tile. However, players will score a point for every 1 or more tile that is connected horizontally or vertically. Then finally negative points will be applied from the Floor Line.Preparing the Next Round: If no one has completed a horizontal line of five tiles than another round will begin. The first player will draw four tiles for each ""factory display"", and then place the first player marker in the center table area.End of Game: When a player completes a horizontal row during the Wall-tiling phase the game is over at the end of the round. Players will do one final scoring, and score additional points for complete horizontal lines (2 points), complete vertical lines (7 points), and covering all tiles belonging to one tile type (10 points). The player will the most points is the winner of the game.Azul is a great game for those beginning to get into board games, and veterans that play all the time. The reason being is it is a fast game with some depth. The game goes by fast for first time players, but that speed increases when people play it again. It works great as a filler game, and something lite enough for people to get into without feeling like they need to spend time learning it. The depth of the game comes from how tiles are placed, and how strategic players want to be. That strategy is looking at what tiles they will risk taking in negative victory points to obtain more victory points at the end, or at that moment. The game can also be mean by player choice as individuals can force a player to take on a lot of negative victory points because they were not counting on everyone passing up a set of tiles. Also, players can choose to pay attention to what they are leaving behind because sometimes someone could set someone else up for a terrific play. Azul, again, is a great game for everyone that likes playing board games. It works exceptionally well as a beginner game, but it is not the type of beginner game that intermediate players will have an issue with playing.Teaching the game: Emphasize that players should pay attention to what tiles they are taking in later turns as they can not only setup other players, but they can give themselves a lot of negative victory points. From this, remember that a Pattern Line cannot have the same tile placed that has already been placed on a players board. Also, the first Pattern Line is only one tile, so the game is moving towards ending rather quickly as the average game is 5 to 7 rounds. For even more advance play, the other side of the player board has a blank wall devoid of any tile type. On this side players must choose where to place their tile with the rule being the same tile type cannot be found in one row.",5.0

Simply put: it's a fun game to play, and you can easily turn off your cut-throat long-term strategy brain and just have fun with it, while your kid does her/his own thing--and it doesn't bore you because you're beating the pants off of your opponent, or taking it easy on them.And that's what I really like about this game. Besides the fact there are no dice, no shuffling of cards, no secret hands, no need for randomization or pre-scripted events. You take turns picking tiles from the bag and even if one person is ""stacking"" the factories, since you take turns, you can't guarantee your cheating will help you--or your opponent. My kids have ""favorite"" tile colors, and that's fine.So this game is very replay-able. And even when my son (who isn't a good loser) loses, he had fun building his tiles, and at times he has found a way to ""stick it to me"" in a round so I take a big point loss, and he counts that as a little victory even if he doesn't win the game. My son is under the recommended age, so this game is easy to learn and play. Maybe he doesn't have the best strategy, but that's the best thing about this game--you don't have to have the best strategy to have fun playing it.Plus, it just plain looks pretty.I should note, most of my play has been head-to-head with one or the other of my kids. It gets more complex with more players.",5.0
514,B077MZ2MPW,R2ISP1PGGLJ27O,A beautiful and engrossing game that's reasonably easy to learn.,"  AZUL is a gorgeous piece of work. I've never opened the box without having someone, gamer or ""civilian,"" say OOOOH! AAAAH! When they see it. The rules are reasonably simple, once you explain the two-phase nature of every round of play; however, there is a bit of wonkiness with the scoring. It looks simple but there's enough strategy and variety in it to reward multiple plays.  There's a lot of room within this deceptively simple setup to try different styles of play. Your game experience could be contemplative OR aggressive, depending on you and your opponents' temperaments. It's possible to play this game as a kind of ""multi-player solitaire"" wherein you and your opponents are just trying to make pretty pictures on your own player boards. Or you can go on the attack and do your best to deny your opponents the tiles they need and leave them with a bunch of penalty tiles they are forced to take.If you are just getting further into the board game hobby (moving past ""gateway games"") and getting into something deeper, or perhaps have a friend who is just getting into it, this is a great game to ask for or give as a gift. It's maybe a bit too complex for younger players or for people who are complete novices in the new realm of board games, but, hey, they can always just admire the pretty tiles. I would give it five stars but a) I hardly ever do that unless a game is a stone-cold classic and b) the rule book was not entirely helpful. But don't let that stop you from getting this excellent game, especially at a reasonable price.",4.0
515,B077MZ2MPW,R2MZT8L81MRV29,Looks great but that's about it,"  I've been looking forward to playing this game for awhile. Looks great and I thought it would be a fun strategy game. Unfortunately, its not much of a strategy game. After playing a two player game, we realized that there is no penalty for using the 1 or two square lines to fill in the tiles. This means that its literally a 5 round (5 minute game) to win. There's no strategy involved in finding tiles, trading tiles, stealing tiles. Its literally just picking up tiles and putting them on the board. Winning involves adding up points, but when anyone can end the game at any time, there's no incentive to go for high points. We literally started making up rules to attempt to force the game to be a little bit challenging. For instance, not being able to end the game without making a plus sign of tiles, or an 'x' across the board, etc. Even with that, it was a pretty lackluster experience.The tiles are pretty and the board looks great. It would be nice if the tiny black score keeper block was heavier or magnetized as its really easy to bump/swipe/move it off the board accidentally. The cardboard game boards are thick, but don't lie down completely flat, and this makes that piece sit even more precariously.Overall, this general conclusion about this game is that it is missing something. Not sure exactly what, but there needs to be added element to make this compelling. The tragedy is that this game feels really close to being really good. But without that extra thing, it comes across as half-baked and fairly lackluster.",2.0
516,B077MZ2MPW,R2YZ160PCOKLT1,Easy yet complex.,"  Azul.A single, simple word but one that I‚Äôll never forget after the hours of fun I had with this game. This is a game to pull out with friends or on a casual game night.It‚Äôs a simple concept - pick up tiles and decide where to place them on your card. The rules are easy to grasp and by the end of the first few turns, you‚Äôll feel like you have the hang of it. However, the strategies are complex. You must take risks, pursue a strategy, and keep an eye on your opponents‚Äô moves. Games aren‚Äôt terribly long which is perfect as I find myself demanding rematches after a loss or wanting to improve my high score after a win.The game itself is beautiful giving you the feeling that you are completing a masterpiece as the game goes on.I recommend this game to both serious and casual gamers.",5.0
517,B077MZ2MPW,R1ETYT4K6MXRZP,"Great family game, easy to learn and difficult to master","  Improvements:1. I drew an arrow on a piece of paper and switched the direction of play after each wall tiling. This reduces frustration if the person to your right is looking for the same pieces.2. The instructions could be better at explaining that you are to continue drawing tiles until there are none left before scoring.  It took one confused round before carefully reading the instructions again for this detail.3. Discard into a bowl instead of the box lid, because it's difficult to transfer from the box lid to the bag without dropping tiles on the floor.What I like:- Everyone gets to play on every turn, unlike some games like Catan- It's easy to learn the rules and get started- There's some complexity, strategy, randomness, and chance- Very reasonable price for this attractive and fun game- The number of tiles ""offered"" per round seems well balanced for the 2-player and 4-players games I tested.",5.0

I typically hate any 2 player games, but this game I'm willing to play with her. I love games that have good replayability and this is one of those games. In addition, I'm always look for ways to modify rules to make game play even better. We love this game, but the original rules do not allow for a very fun game. In the original rules, the game ends when you have one horizontal line (+2pts). The problem is playing with this rule everyone goes for the top line and the game lasts 5 minutes. However, we changed the following rules to add more strategy and to speed up the game:1) the game ends when a player creates one vertical line (+7pts) and allow people to score as many horizontal (+2pts) and all 5 same color tiles (+10pts)2) immediate scoring and therefore we do not wait until all of the tiles in the middle are gone (which allows a player to complete multiple tiles in a row)",5.0

It is easy to learn, allows conversation during play.  One learns fairly quickly that there is a strategic way to win at this game.  We often get our grandchildren started with games by simply playing with the parts, getting used to the board and tile pieces.  Even our four year old grandson likes making patterns with the tile pieces.  Our eight year old granddaughter asks to play Azul- and she is good at it.  There is an option to the way in which the game is played, using the back side of the game board, making your own patterns.  We have not tried this option but surely it would provide an additional challenge.",5.0
520,B00A2HD40E,R2DK8EP82ZGNWP,So This is How Child Endangerment Starts,"  My wife and I have gradually gotten more into board games, because we're old and lame and that's ok. She's a bit ... competitive, however, so even playing a game like Settlers can put me on the edge of the seat a little bit if I'm winning. Some of you know what I'm talking about. Board games kept popping up in my Amazon recommendations, and I kept seeing this one (nice work, Amazon ad algorythms). Cooperative? Sounds good!There went that Sunday. I even stopped watching football, BECAUSE CHILDREN ARE DYING IN ISTANBUL OR CONSTANTINOPLE. We played several games. We lost our first few, then kept winning. Our kids were annoying us with petty stuff like, ""Daddy, I'm hungry"" and ""Mommy, my toe fell off"" but sometimes you just have to tell your kids that now isn't a good time, because Daddy is building a research center and then has to fly to meet Mommy in Milan, and there is leftover ham in the refrigerator.I do question whether the game will keep its challenge. We've won our only two games on the hardest difficulty, but it felt suspenseful and like we could have lost, so I think it'll still be fun to play. Regardless, we've already gotten our money's worth out of this game. I think my daughter (six) will be able to learn it now or shortly as well, which will be cool and we can monitor her toe situation better.",5.0

Play this game with a stranger to get to know them.  I promise that by the end of the game that you will know whether they will become your beast of a best friend forever or labeled a selfish, uncooperative squat head to be despised forever.

It will foretell whether or not you and your interest will successfully spawn offspring together.After opening this box for the first time, my roommates and I spent countless nights trying to save the world.  As frustrating as it is to lose to a piece of cardboard, it is equally, if not more, gratifying to conquer your imaginary microscopic adversaries.  There are so many occasions where you end the game in despair wishing you had just one more turn.

522,B00A2HD40E,R3HEYHWHQXGQ21,Spite,"  It seemed like we‚Äôd just started the game and the yellow strain had not only been cured but eradicated!  We were on the cusp of a cure for the second strain.  This one was in the bag.  We had weathered two epidemics so far without any egregious problems.  Sure there was a pair of cities in Eastern Europe that was in danger, but what were the odds that was going to be a problem?  One of us was already there.  Then another epidemic hit, the infection rate increased, three cities were drawn and it seemed the cascading outbreaks knew no bounds.  I think nearly everyone in Europe died that day, and we ‚Äì a group of specialized scientists- were served a plate of bitter defeat.  Again!  Again and again, always defeat.  Oh, the humanity!It‚Äôs true, I haven‚Äôt ever beat this rotten game and yet I keep coming back.  Because one day I‚Äôll win;  in spite of all the wounds to my pride I‚Äôve had to nurse, one day I‚Äôll ‚Äì I mean- we‚Äôll win.  I say we‚Äôll because this is a co-operative game where you all work together against those nasty strains of no-doubt-human engineered beasties.  Now, I know there are those of you who beat this every time you play, like I beat Shadows over Camelot every time I play, but I‚Äôve invited those sorts to come play with me and they can barely stand the shame of losing with me.To make it even worse, we only play with 4 epidemics.  I feel like I‚Äôm at an AA meeting:  ‚ÄúHi my name is Kyle.‚Äù‚ÄúHi Kyle‚Äù echoes the crowd.‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I suck at Pandemic.‚ÄùThis is the part where you put your arm on my shoulder and tell me it‚Äôs going to be alright.Game PlayThis board is a handsome map of the world; only instead of country boards you see in Risk there is a red web of interconnected cities.  Everyone starts in Atlanta were a research station is and you go from there.  Each player plays a scientist that has a special ability: one can move others on their turn, one can give cards to another without the restrictions other players have and so on.  The game also begins with 9 random cities around the world with varying degrees of infection (one to three stacked blocks).  If a city would have a fourth block put on it (called an outbreak), it actually stays at three and the cities connected by the red web get a block.  Isn‚Äôt that nice?  It‚Äôs called a cascading outbreak.  Such a pretty name.  If you get 9 outbreaks in a game you lose.  If you run out of blocks for a certain strain you lose, and if you haven‚Äôt cured all the strains before your white deck of cards runs out, you lose.  I hate to be a negative Nancy, but there‚Äôs a lot of ways to lose this game.  If, on the other hand, you are able to find cures for each strain, you win!How do you do that? Well you get someone who has got 5 cards of the same color in their hand to a research station, that‚Äôs how.  One of the players only needs four.Every turn each player gets to do four actions.  Picking up a cube off a city counts as one, so does moving between cities.  You can charter flights with your cards, rather than use them for cures.  You can build research stations and fly between those without expending a card, and a few other things.  Then you draw cards that you think will help you, but can instead turn out to be epidemics.  And you also draw cards for cities that get infected: usually this amounts to adding on square to the city‚Äôs pile.  As the game progresses, more cards are drawn at a time to be infected.  Oh, and when an epidemic happens, the cards for the cities that were infected get put back on the top of the draw pile.  Oh dear.I hate to tell you what to do because what do I know anyway?Those of you who beat this all the time should tell me what to do.  I understand that finding the cures is everything- lest you run out of time.  Others say, make sure that you never have three on on e city at a time, as to avoid outbreaks.Make sure that the medic is only clearing off stacks of infections, the dispatcher should be moving people so that don‚Äôt have to move themselves.Again, I never win, so what do I know?ThemeIf it hasn‚Äôt been obvious, I am completely sucked in by the theme.  There are similarities to other co-operative games especially Forbidden Island:  Each character has special powers, you make moves for the team and then the board pushed you closer to defeat, that sort of thing.  Forbidden Island also shares the shuffle the cards and put them back on top of the draw deck mechanic.  I tell you this so that you won‚Äôt be surprised if you decide to add them both to your game closet, this is why I haven‚Äôt added Forbidden Island to mine, though I‚Äôve played the game.  While this adds to the evidence that the theme could be stripped out of the game, I don‚Äôt recall cascading flooding going on in Forbidden Island, or feeling like humanity is hanging in the balance, or being glad I don‚Äôt live anywhere in Eastern Europe.  That is to say, I think the theme sticks.BalanceI read about people who win all the time and needed the expansion to rouse any concern in them.  But who can believe everything they read on the internet, I ask you?  Just because I‚Äôve never won though doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs not an enjoyable experience, mind you.  Because I keep coming back.InteractionInteraction is very high.  There‚Äôs all sort of collaborative discussion that goes on through this game.Learning CurveLow.  It takes all of ten minutes to explain and there are directions on the board and the turn cards.DowntimeNill.  You are all in it together!  And you even get to move a guy in your turn.What‚Äôs not to Like?I actually know where some of these cities are on the map are but they all have these lines that go from the pin-pointed location to the circle where you actually place the blocks.  That remains a bit annoying even after playing the game 10 times.Collateral EndorsementMy four year old likes ‚ÄúThe one where they get sick‚Äù  We run around curing cities till the infection deck runs out.  He feels a lot better about himself than the rage I feel playing by the real rules.Actually, as I think about it, the first time I played this game I was at the home of some friends and I think we won.  But I‚Äôm certain I have not won with my copy of the game.  I‚Äôd say mine is jinxed, but we‚Äôve played on another friends copy and lost there too.  Also, I should say that a brother of mine lost two in a row and saw the writing on the wall in the third game and left the table, swearing off the game forever.

I originally picked it up because I got Pandemic Legacy for a very, very good price, and in the directions they tell you to play a few games of the original first to get your feet wet, so I bought it. This is probably one of my favorite games. I play anywhere from 1 to 4 players, while playing alone I'll play 2 rolls.Be warned, you won't win. Out of 17 games, I have a 29% win ratio on it. The game normally wins, but that is part of the fun of the game, when you win as a team it feels more of a victory.This is a co-op game, all players are on the same team and work together, and because of that, you can get the Alpha-Gamer in the group that tells you how things should be done, so just be aware of that.

Some of our favorites: Settlers of Catan, Fluxx, Munchkin, Phase 10, Parcheesi, Sushi Go!, some of the Cheap-Ass games, just to give you an idea.We like having a variety of types of play to switch things up & keep us interested, but once in a while a game is simply addictive & we can play it over & over for hours.  Settlers is like that for us (even after many years).  And now Pandemic is, too.  We just can't stop playing!It's definitely challenging.  One of the great features is that you can increase the difficulty level once you start feeling like the game has become easy.  But don't judge that too fast, either.  There are so many factors that add variety to the game from play to play.  For example, the random assignment of a Role for each player means that your characters' combination of special abilities are different each game, so you need to adjust your strategy to take the best advantage of them.One reason I chose this is because feedback about playing with two players was positive.  Most of our games require at least the 3 of us to be any fun.  And pretty soon my son will be moving out, so we'll need some good two player games.  This weekend we got to test it with 2 people, and it was absolutely just as fun as with 3.  In fact, it surprised us because it required such a different strategy than with the 3 of us.  And once we adjusted and began winning at the lowest difficulty, we tried the next level and found we had to shift gears again. (And wow that level is tough)This is the first cooperative game we've owned, and we love that about it.  None of us is particularly competitive, so we find this a really nice change from the usual.

Pandemic Board Game

OverviewPandemic is a cooperative game where you‚Äôre working together to cure diseases and prevent a worldwide pandemic.  If disease spreads too far, you lose.  If you find cures for all of the diseases and eradicate them you win.  There are multiple roles you and your team mates can play, each with unique powers that allow you to work around the rules in a specific way.Pros:There is a high sense of urgency and tension in the game.  Working against the game to win in time really draws you into the theme.The cooperative aspect of this game is great if you're not in the mood to play against your friends and family.  Playing as a team can create a great bond with the other players, especially when you get down to that last nail-biting turn.High level of difficulty and replay-ability, with rules to make the game harder once you've mastered the basic game.This game really makes you work together to win.  If everyone just does their own thing, you will lose for sure.  The rules even encourage discussion before making any actions.It really does an excellent job of making the game a challenging opponent.  The game's ""AI"", that is, the way you draw cards and spread the diseases through ""outbreaks"" means that the game is very difficult without requiring a player to make decisions.Cons:The game can be very hard, even on the easiest setting.  I have yet to actually win the game, even with six plays under my belt.Be prepared to lose the first few plays.Mood: Thinky, Cooperative, Strategic",5.0
527,B00A2HD40E,R2RY6L4B993DO1,Great Co-op Board Game,"  This is a great cooperative board game to play with your friends or gaming group.I've played this with many different groups of people now and every experience was positive and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves very much while playing.  Having a great cooperative game in your rotation is a good way to get people who don't like the competition aspect of games to be able to enjoy themselves too.The game itself is fairly easy to get the hang of after a few turns and allows for great strategy sessions where you work together to eradicate the various diseases on the board to trigger the win condition.  Playing at maximum difficulty will generally be pretty challenging and will require good planning and communication with the other players in order to succeed.This is one of those games that is tough to win, but tends to make people want to play ""just one more time, I know we'll get it this time"".  It's that enjoyable.  This one tends to be a favorite in our board gaming group, and we keep bringing it out time and again.The only issue that I have with the game set is that the instructions aren't the easiest to read if you want a quick summary of win conditions and such.  I had to read them a couple times to figure out some of the more nuanced game rules and situations that tended to come up quite a bit more than expected.No other issues to this really fun game.Highest Recommendation.",5.0

529,B00A2HD40E,RV4V1TEVQ0XRD,Is there a doctor in the house?,"  I was originally introduced to this game by a student of mine, who had been working with me on disease modeling.  After reading some of the great reviews of the game, my wife and I decided to purchase it last year.  We can't say enough how much we enjoy playing this game; it makes you think, and, more importantly, you have to work together!My wife and I love playing board games, but some of our board games can get fairly competitive and, in some cases, can leave bad feelings afterward (we don't play trivia games anymore because of this!).  If you've had these feelings, then Pandemic is the game for you:  You don't compete against each other, but against the game board.  This means, you can talk, you can share information, and you can strategize together openly.  And, if you win, it's a strong sense of accomplishment; if you lose, you can always try again!To the game itself:  We love the quality of the pieces (sturdy plastic for the disease cubes and game pawns, well-made cards that have withstood numerous plays and shuffles, and a very sleek game board and box!), but we especially love that it's a different game every time.  Each of you randomly selects your role, giving each of you a special ability that can help your team.  You then randomly place disease cubes on the board, and then start trying to find cures.  Sometimes, you get lucky, and you can discover cures quickly, but, other times, epidemic cards come up so quickly that you don't know what hit your team!  Admittedly, the first few plays are slow, because there are a lot of rules to keep track of.  But, after a few plays, you really get the hang of it, and, since you are working together, you can help each other learn the game.  We've found that a typical game takes around 30-45 minutes, which is a good length of time.Finally, I'll say that one other thing we really like about this game is you can adjust the difficulty:  make it easier by putting in less epidemic cards or laying your hands on the table so everyone can see, or make it harder by adding in more epidemic cards and/or playing with expansion packs.  Some other rule changes to make the game more challenging are included in the main rules.The few complaints we have had about the game are that the game is only for 2-4 players (more requires an expansion pack), so, if your family or board game group is large, keep this in mind.  Also, although the game is cooperative, it is hard!  We're currently on a streak where we haven't won a game in weeks, but I'm hoping we'll save humanity soon enough!Anyway, if you've been growing sick (he he he) of the ""standard"" board games, give this one a try.  It was our first venture outside of ""standard"" board games, and Pandemic is why we now own Ticket to Ride and Forbidden Island, and are looking at Settlers of Catan.  This coming from people who started out with Monopoly, Clue, and Life!",5.0
530,B00A2HD40E,R2WK3EK1QWBZET,"Felt a little one-dimensional, did not want to play again","  This game reminds me of playing Risk as a child.  There are ""certain things you have to do"" but the role each player has is rather limited and you will end up finding yourself pigeonholed to ""bring all the cards"", ""cure all the people"", or generally running around (or maybe staying put) to keep doing one same thing.  Which is one reason I left the corporate world, I found this boring.  I'd rather have a dozen different problems to solve in any week, rather than being able to do the same thing every day with my eyes closed.  In some ways this reminds me of Forbidden Island - co-operative, assume a particular role, but for some reason I find that game more engaging and enjoyable where I didn't want to play again with this one.  Other games I have tried recently, and enjoyed, were Qwixx, Spell Smashers, and the charmingly named Rat-a-Tat-Cat!",2.0
531,B00A2HD40E,R2SXJJ78JEJFZI,Fantastic co-operative fun,"  My friends and I play tabletop games and other, more advanced head-to-head board games like Risk and Axis & Allies, so we are generally familiar with rule sets and games in general.  This had been recommended to me by Amazon for literal years, but I had always hesitated.It went on a good black friday sale price, and I pulled the trigger because so many people in public forums have compared other games back to this.  I wish I would have done it sooner.Our first game was our longest, as we followed the included rule book carefully and in a procedural manner.  I'm told this is an improved version of the original, but I will say I wish the rulebook was more explicit to what causes an ""outbreak"" but we were able to figure it out by playing.  A simple line I wish was stated specifically:Outbreaks:  These occur if any city that already has 3 infection markers on it gets another infection marker.  Follow the outbreak rules section when this happens.Once we had a grasp of the rules, my group (all adults in our 30's) VERY quickly got into the strategy of the game, and the discussions of what to do next was exciting and rapid.  We loved being on the same side for once, working against the deck.  Our first game we won almost easily, the second we made harder with 5 epidemic cards instead of 4, and despite some solid effort, we lost!  I like this that way, if we could easily win every time we would get bored quickly.  The loss left us wanting to go again, but we were out of time.First game took us about an hour and 15, but our second game was much much faster.  Probably closer to 40 minutes.The overall rules are simple enough that I would say kids can definitely grasp it after a few play thru's.  This game has been very addicting for us, we may clear our schedules of other games for a while.

532,B00A2HD40E,R17E6JJ0STYU0X,Told the Kids it was Government Issued During COVID-19,"  The game is a bit sophisticated and difficult to remember all the rules, but it‚Äôs a great game and for anyone who is accustomed to board games it‚Äôs bound to be a favorite. It‚Äôs a strategy game, which means you have to be on top of it, and my guess is it‚Äôs one of those games that you‚Äôll get better at if you play it several times or even on the regular. I don‚Äôt do anything regularly (except maybe work and exercise and cook) so it‚Äôs hard to get good at something/anything if you only do it every few weeks. But here we are in an actual pandemic and so I thought it might be fun and relevant to play a board game called pandemic. And funny thing, amazon was only delivering essentials and this came right along with my bulk lentils and rice and well in advance of my TP & PT. So we decided to tell the kids that it was government issued by trump and that moving onto the next grade depended on whether they beat it, and they didn‚Äôt beat it and then the kids stressed out and I am a tiny bit concerned that could be considered psychological abuse given the circumstances. I think they‚Äôre over it, or maybe not, since according to their Dad one of them was obsessing over an assignment on his iPad outside in the rain during a nature walk. Homeschooling is strange. So are daytime pajamas & Zoom dress codes. My honey and I are about 2 for 3 in our winning of this game, so maybe we will get one of those $1.2M stimulus checks that some folks are getting if they had an AGI over $1M last year. It does kick us up a notch in some way I‚Äôd think, but I‚Äôll have to call Fauci to know for sure.",5.0
533,B00A2HD40E,R24ZPKQ5ZQXQSI,Great cooperative game for 8yrs and up.,"  I picked this up in 2016 as a Christmas gift for my 13 year-old daughter.  I was trying to  introduce my family to some new board games in an effort to get the kids to spend less time on video games.  Pandemic was a hit with my daughter, my 9 year-old son, and myself (unfortunately, my wife refuses to play those ""weird games"").I can't add much more than others have already said.  However, since my family was new to cooperative games and this style of game expected that we might have problems understanding the rules which might cause short-attention-span kids to quickly lose interest.  To alleviate that I purchased the iPad version and played a few times myself prior to gifting Pandemic to my daughter.  It ended up being a great decision on my part and we were able to start paling relatively quickly.  I mentioned, we all enjoyed it and my daughter prefers it to ""Forbidden Island"" and ""Ticket to Ride.""  I enjoy all three, and my 10 year-old son prefers cooperative games such as this.The only downside is that the ""cooperative"" component sometimes turns into an ""argumentative"" component when there's more than one strong-willed player who thinks their strategy is the best.",5.0
534,B00A2HD40E,R2DZ8H3WYN75P3,A Great Gateway Game,"  Pandemic is legendary. It's tense, but it's a lot of fun. This is a great game for 2 to 4 players, but you can also play it solo by controlling more than one of the character roles.Your mission is to cure epidemic breakouts of four different types of disease before they spread out of control. You work together with other types of medical professionals to travel the world learning how to treat and ultimately cure the diseases.Pandemic is one of my favorite ""gateway"" games. A gateway game moves a non-gamer toward becoming a gamer. Or introduces someone who has only played mass market games like Monopoly or Clue to the world of games that are actually good. Pandemic is also a good introduction to cooperative gaming, where all the players work together as a team to beat the game rather than competitively trying to beat each other.This has become my wife's favorite game. She loves it because it is challenging but not impossible to beat, it is quick and easy to set up and put away, and 2-player games last anywhere from 15 to 45 minutes. Whenever we pull it out (which is frequently) we normally play it two or three times.Pandemic has inspired many other similar games, but it remains a classic. Highly recommended.",5.0

536,B00A2HD40E,R2ANC5P3DVPHSJ,Co-op game that makes you think,"  Pros: High quality components, challenging, requires strategyCons: Can be too random, one person can take over if you're not carefulExcellent cooperative game. I got this to play with my girlfriend, and we've played with our families and some friends as well. It is very easy to teach since you're all on the same team, so you can show people how to play as you play. It also lets you choose how difficult you want it to be by letting you decide how many Epidemic cards you add to the player deck. When these are drawn, they will make you infect more cities each turn and they will cause all the cities you have already infected to be shuffled and placed back on top, so they will keep getting more disease added to them. The more Epidemic cards there are, the harder the game gets because this happens more often.It requires a lot of foresight and strategy if you want to win, as you always have to be aware of what cities are potentially going to be drawn, and if you get close to the end you need to remember that there are only a set number of turns. Each player has a different ability that they can use, so we have found that it can be easier to play with more people, as this gives you access to more abilities. However, in the games I have played, we have both won and lost with 2, 3, and 4 people playing. It can certainly be tough depending on the game.And that's why I'm rating it 4 stars. I really like the game, and, as a side note, the physical game itself is outstanding. The box is very sturdy with spaces inside for all the pieces and cards. The cards are sturdy and the player pieces and ""disease cubes"" are all beautiful (everyone comments on how nice the components are). However, the game play can vary greatly. Sometimes you'll win easily, sometimes you'll win at the last second, sometimes you'll get crushed early, sometimes you'll lose just when you think you've won it. This can be a good and bad thing. I like that there's no way to ""figure it out"" and win every time, but it would be nice if it wasn't as random. (I suppose you could decide where to put the Epidemic cards in the deck, but we haven't tried that.) I played with my brother once and we won very easily, and now he's convinced that it is too trivial.All in all, I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a challenging co-op game.",4.0
537,B00A2HD40E,R33HV0IVMKE5L8,"Fun, Addictive Game Without Competition","  It's a co-op game - you fight the board, not each other, and I love that, especially in a family that is full of competitive people. The more people you have playing it can be a really long game. Although it's co-op you don't have to share your cards with everybody and let them know what you have. Before you start the game, you may want to make it clear to everybody else that the game consists of teamwork, but nobody is leader. I know there can be some forceful personalities; it sucks the fun out of the game when people are telling you what to do, and you feel like it's not even really your turn, but their turn nonstop with your character.There's three ways to die, so that makes it fun! You're in a hurry to figure out how to survive. Some rules are unclear and confusing. Look online, and there's a lot of people there to clarify the rules. The first time I played it was with two friends. We misunderstood a lot of the rules and went all over the place, and even changed rules in the middle of turns, to try to sort it out better. It wasn't a proper game at all, but it was loads of fun, and we won right before there were no cards left to draw. My friends also have this obsession with the asian character guy, so they always hope and pray they get him when we mystery pull character roles. And no, they've never pulled him. I did once. They hated me. :)",5.0
538,B00A2HD40E,RB4MWX62E5991,seriously love this,"  SO my husband and I really like playing games together. We try to find a lot of games that work for only 2 people playing. Since we started having babies, our social life just is not a thing. So we just have each other and if it requires more than 2 we can't play. We really had enjoyed the game forbidden dessert! Seriously loved it. And then because we were so into that we stumbled upon this one and its the same line of game. Just different moving parts and more parts so it takes the game play up a level!We have decided that over the years it is better for my husband and I to not do competitive games! We can't to heated and neither are very good at losing. (We are working on this though so the kids learn its ok to lose) So BONUS! This is a cooperative game. Not going against each other but the board. So it is a house full of harmony then! lol... as for all other games we just stopped taking score haha",5.0
539,B00A2HD40E,R24K12V5MVPGQZ,First Serious Board Game in Years,"  I've only recently gotten on the bandwagon to the return of board games, but I didn't know where to jump on. I wanted a cooperative game, so those I play with will be more inclined to join in, and Pandemic was at the top of many lists of that category. It's fun yet challenging, with loads of replay-ability. We've only played a dozen or so times, losing more than half of those, but we don't feel discouraged in another go at curing diseases.Having said that, although I still consider myself an amateur at this game, I feel too much success/failure depends on which characters you draw. Some amazing combinations can be made with whichever ones are drawn, but some are definitely better than others, and too much time can be spent deciding on how to coordinate each move rather than simply enjoying the game... that's likely due to those playing overthinking everything though.Either way, I highly recommend this game, even to newbies like myself!",4.0
540,B00A2HD40E,R2DWDC0J4LYHV8,Best game EVER!,"  Okay, to start out, I love love LOVE Pandemic!  I admit it, I'm a bit competitive.  I hate losing games.  I'm generally fine with competitive games where the best strategist (or luckiest) wins, but I really dislike games (like Settlers of Catan) where some players can gang up on others.  You pretty much don't have a chance when every other player is specifically playing against YOU.  Pandemic is fantastic because you cooperative with the other players and you all win or lose together.  I just absolutely love sitting at the table talking about all our options and strategizing together.My son introduced me to Pandemic several months ago, and I was hooked.  We've spent several afternoons/evenings playing again--and again--and again.  On many occasions when I am home alone, I play all by myself (playing two roles), and we've also played four players on several occasions.With two players and four epidemics, we win every time.  With five epidemics, we win about 70% of the time.  We've tried six epidemics a couple times, but have not been able to beat that game yet.  Still trying!  Ugh!  As you increase the number of players, the game gets more difficult.  With four players we've only played with four epidemics, and we win probably a little over half the time.  I honestly think it would be impossible with four players and six epidemics, but someone has probably proven me wrong.We've even discovered another way to lose the game, which is not listed in the rule book!  It says you can lose by having too many outbreaks, running out of disease cubes, or running out of player cards.  We've lost in all those lovely ways.  However, a couple of times, we've had only a few outbreaks, had plenty of cubes of each color left, and plenty of player cards.  Three diseases cured, with only one to go.  One of those times, we'd even gotten through all the epidemics, so there were none left in the infection deck!  We've got it made, right?  Uh, no.  Turns out we discarded too many of the same color city cards, and there were only four left total, including in our hands and in the player deck.  Neither of us was the Scientist, so that was an automatic loss.  This is a danger when you get dealt a nice hand at the beginning, say two or even three of the same color.  You decide to collect those, so when you discard, you are discarding the other colors.  If you happen to keep drawing you ""discard"" color and it takes too long to collect the color(s) you want, you've now discarded too many of the other color and you don't have enough left at the end to cure the disease.  Beware.We have also managed to lose the game on the very first turn.  We were very unlucky drawing the infection cards when setting up the game:  three on Karachi and Delhi, and two on Kolkata.  Our first player did not have any way to get to that location to do even a little treating, and the first card drawn from the player deck was an epidemic.  After resolving the epidemic, the first card drawn was Delhi, which caused a double outbreak (Delhi/Karachi) and put the third cube on Kolkata.  The second card drawn was Kolkata, which was a triple outbreak (Kolkata/Delhi/Karachi) and lost us the game as there weren't enough disease cubes.  Yep, lost on the very first player card drawn and there was not a single thing we could do about it.One slight change we sometimes make in the game is to draw 10 cards at the beginning instead of 9.  The first nine infect the cities, and the tenth is where we place our player pawns and the first research station.  It adds a level of difficulty to the game to not always start in Atlanta.  We were noticing before that we always seemed to get in trouble with black and red, and we believe it was because all our players started so close to blue and yellow so those cities were easy to get to and treat.  Now that we can start anywhere on the board, blue and yellow have become equal opportunity killers.There are a few things it is easy to get wrong.  When the infection rate moves up, it's easy to forget to start drawing three cards (or four) since you're so accustomed to the lower number.  It's also easy to forget to discard, not noticing that you have more than 7 cards in your hand.  One scenario we've encountered a few times involves having 8 cards for literally a second.  You meet another player on top of a research station, and share knowledge by pulling that city card from her.  You now have 8 cards in your hand, but 5 of one color.  Your very next action is going to be curing a disease, which will leave you with only 3 cards.  But, before you cure that disease, you have 8 cards, so we think you have to discard one even though literally on your next action you will be discarding 5 cards.  This is a little frustrating, but the rules specifically say that if you EVER (my emphasis) have more than 7 cards in your hand, you must discard (or play an event card).We were also a little confused by the role of the Researcher the first time we played.  To be clear, when the Researcher shares knowledge, she and the other player must be on the same city, and the card can only go FROM the Researcher TO the other player (on either player's turn, as an action).  She cannot take a card from the other player (and they cannot give one to her), unless it matches the city they are sitting on.It is also extremely easy to forget to infect cities after resolving an epidemic.  You've spent a bunch of time resolving, then strategizing based on where the board stands now, and you completely forget that you still have to infect before going to the next player.Lastly, you are not supposed to choose your roles.  We played with one person who had played before, and he said they always choose which roles they want.  I suppose you can play that way if you want, but the game would be far less interesting because people would probably tend to choose the same roles every time.  The instructions say to shuffle the role cards and deal them to each player -- that means they're supposed to be random.  It's far more interesting and challenging when the roles change every time.  A good part of the strategy is figuring out how to maximize the advantages that each role gives you in any given game.Pandemic is basically figuring out exactly how much effort you have to spend in each game sharing knowledge in order to cure diseases versus preventing outbreaks, all while maximizing the strategic use of whatever role you are playing.  Spend too much time on one, and the other will get you.  Sometimes you just have to say ""oh well"" and let an outbreak happen, even when you could have prevented it.  It may just be more important to get to that one city in order to share knowledge than to get to the city where the outbreak is about to happen in order to prevent it.  However we do try hard to prevent double outbreaks because things can get very bad very quickly when that happens.Okay I've rambled enough.  If you're on the edge, buy this game!  It's awesome.  Every game is different and it never gets boring.  It is equally fun with two or more players, although the more players, the more challenging it is.  You can control the difficulty level by player with fewer or more epidemic cards.  A+",5.0
541,B00A2HD40E,RAZXBICZ8WSHG,Game is fun and interesting. Good 2 player game,"  I have found the game to be fun and interesting. At the learning stage of the game, it took a bit of time to figure out how to play it. There was just a lot of steps and rules. There is a lot going on in the game. It seemed a bit confusing a first. Once I got into the swing of things, it was not so bad.I like how you can get different roles each time one plays the game. It makes it more interesting. It has different challenge levels too. This is a fun game with two players. I think 3-4 players make it more challenging as well. Since it is a co-op game, an extra player hand can be made if there is only 2 players.The thing I do not like is that it took me a while to get used to the game. There is a lot going on. It makes sense why there are reference cards to give to the players. I got used to it after the second game. The other thing is to win the game is to cure all the diseases. I think it would be more fun to be able to eradicate all the diseases. It would also make the playtime longer though if that was the case. The other thing is I do not like how one of the ways to lose is when the entire player deck is gone. It feels like it shortens the playtime a bit, especially if I am into the game and want to continue playing to see if I can cure everything before I get to many outbreaks, which is another way to end the game,",4.0

Working with my friends and family instead of against them was a great change of pace after years of royal rumble style board gaming. This game is just as fun to play with 2 people as it is with several more and no two games of Pandemic are the same. It is just as easy to lose this game as it is to win and losing only makes me want to play it again. I have begun to purchase the expansion sets and each new update only makes the game more entertaining and fun. That being said, the original game is extremely replayable and worth every penny.

543,B00A2HD40E,R1A04ZTUGT7ZI7,One of those rare fun 2-player coop games that doesn't get boring,"  My boyfriend and I just can't play competitive games against each other. They always end with one of us gloating and the other glowering, muttering profanities under their breath. So, we decided that we'd try to find a good cooperative game. Unfortunately, good two-player coop games are tough to come by.That's why we're so happy to have found Pandemic. It's you against the board WITH your partner (up to four people). The game is really easy to catch on to; after playing through the first few moves, we both got the hang of it. You definitely don't need to be a hugely experienced boardgame player to enjoy it.There are tons of small parts and nuances to each game, so I do recommend limiting the game to 10 years old and up. Expect your first game to last 90 minutes with the learning curve, but that time will quickly reduce to an hour or so after you understand how to play the game. Set up takes five minutes.Overall, the game is replayable and thoroughly enjoyable. My boyfriend and I are both not super great at it (yet), but I would much rather be conquering this game WITH him than tearfully conceding another game TO him. At least, now, I have a chance.",5.0
544,B00A2HD40E,R195KNTZBB1O88,"Diseases, Infections & Outbreaks...Oh My!!!","  ¬†If anyone has read my reviews and/or answers on questions you will see that in the past year my family has gotten really into the Ticket To Ride (TTR) games.  Well, while purchasing one of my latest TTR expansions I stumbled upon the Pandemic games; which are similar to the TTR ones in that you start with a base game, get the foundation for rules and game play and then you start moving on to expansions with additional features.  I purchased Pandemic and with Amazon Prime it was delivered in less than 24 hours, no kidding!  As is my usual custom I read the instruction manual and then because I am a visual learner I went to You Tube to watch some videos.  ZManGamesOfficial does a 9.5 minute brief tutorial.  WatchItPlayed does a wonderful job walking you through the game prep for a 2-player game including where all pieces, cards, etc. go.  This was very helpful as there are specific instructions on how to shuffle and stack the Player Cards.  My niece and I had this video up while setting up the first game.  Finally, I watched Geek & Sundry do their TableTop version of the game where you actually get to see the players play.  They have an abbreviated video and then a 1.5 hour extended game play.  So, these are just tips that helped us get an understanding of the game play and we had a blast!Pandemic allows you to travel from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta and you travel throughout the world trying to cure and eradicate 4 diseases.  The instructions make it sound so easy but oh boy; it is not.  Game play can be learned in about 15-30 minutes.  The difficult part and it is not the actual game-play; is trying to come up with enough strategies fast enough to cure and eradicate the diseases before you and your team die!  Yes, team...unlike TTR this is not a game 1 player wins.  It's a collaborative game in which all players work together...you discuss how you can unite forces, share your special roles, your cards, etc.  But be careful of an alpha player who may start bossing people around, telling them what to do and takes charge of the game. If you get an alpha player just let them have the game board, pawns, etc. and tell them to play the game by them self but as if they were many players.  In the end if it's your turn you can listen to others, even the alpha player, but what you do is totally up to you.  If you don't have a good strategy everyone loses...my niece and I call it dying because we have succumbed to the disease.So, why is it a race against the clock?  Well, no matter how well your strategy, your team can ""die"" IF you: Have 8 outbreaks before curing/eradicating all 4 diseases, you run out of Disease Cubes or Player Cards. Note: You don't have to eradicate all 4 diseases to win; you just have to cure all 4. First game we cured all 4 diseases and eradicated the yellow (""Crazy Banana Disease"") but we got 8 outbreaks...we saved the world!  2nd game; yes, we played another because we were feeling lucky!  We cured all 4 diseases, didn't eradicate any and once again we saved the world.  We named our diseases the Black Zombie Plague, Purple People Eater (Blue cubes), Angry Bird Virus (red) and of course the Crazy Banana Disease (yellow) because my niece named it while infecting Miami.During your turn you can play up to 4 actions, draw 2 Player Cards but you cannot be holding more than 7 at any given time and then you MUST infect cities!  The Infection Rate starts at 2 cities per player, per turn.  But every time a player draws an Epidemic Card they have to move the Infection Rate marker and it slowly increases the Infection Rate from 2 cities up to 4 cities.  The Epidemic card also requires you to draw 1 city from the bottom of the Infection cards and you must infect that city with 3 disease cubes; 1 more cube of the same color and you have an outbreak, oh my!  Finally, the Epidemic Card requires you to ""intensify"" the Infection Cards. That means you must shuffle all the Infection Cards (cities) that have been played since the last epidemic, including the city card you just drew from the Infection Card pile and then put them back on top of the Infection Card pile so they now go back into play.  See the intensity?  With just my niece and me playing we didn't have as many cards to reshuffle so we kept infecting the same cities; which in essence was then producing outbreaks faster.  I ""think"" you may have a longer game play with more people because then the other players will also be contributing cards.An outbreak occurs if/when a city accumulates 4 of the same color disease cubes. When this happens you must put a disease cube of that same color in every city that is directly attached to the city that the outbreak occurred in, thus, the epidemic.  Note: It's possible that you have infected a city with more than 1 disease so IF you have 4 or more disease cubes but they are different colors you do NOT have an outbreak.  The outbreak is only when you get 4 of the same color in the same city but the 4th cube (same color) will not be placed on the city.  So watch those disease cubes and treat and cure so you can prevent the outbreaks.Now when you play up to 4 actions during each turn you have an option to treat a disease.  You treat by removing 1 or more disease cubes from the city you are in (each cube being an action) that you have used your actions and/or role to get to.  I was the Medic during first game and one of my roles allowed me to remove ALL disease cubes from the city I was in or traveled to!  The Dispatcher can move players from city to city with their permission so once again...If you have a Dispatcher in the same game with a Medic you can move the Medic to the city that needs to be treated and get rid of all the disease cubes.  IF the disease has been cured (see above pic...the disease markers are solid colors and moved above the disease logos) then you get to remove ALL the disease cubes in that city EVEN IF you aren't the Medic.  To eradicate the disease you must remove ALL disease cubes of the same color from every city on the board.  When you have eradicated the disease you flip the disease marker over to reveal the little log for eradicated.  Note: Cities can still be infected if the disease has been cured but NOT if it has been eradicated.Back to the outbreaks.  There's also an outbreak chart with marker and each time an outbreak occurs you have to move the marker.  If you have 8 outbreaks the game is over and there is no winner because everyone has died.  You also have Research Stations and these are nice because there is one action that allows you to shuttle from station to station and that can get you closer to an infested area to have a chance to treat, cure and/or eradicate several or all cities.  There are also Role Cards and pawns to match the color of your role.  Each role has special duties that only that player can perform (see above with Medic and Dispatcher).  You don't get to choose your color/role.  Pandemic is for 2-4 players and there are 6 Role Cards so you won't have all 6 roles in game play at the same time.  There is another extension that adds a 5th player.I know there is a lot more that can be said and I or someone else can try to answer your questions.  I just played for the first time last night (4/13/19) and while playing the 2nd game I came to Amazon and we read descriptions for some the expansions.  I immediately ordered Pandemic: The Cure--Experimental Meds and then about 2 hours later I ordered Pandemic: State Of Emergency (this introduces diseases/infections from animals). So as you can see this is how pleased I was with Pandemic and yes, we are still playing TTR...I will be posting some more reviews on those as well because I currently have 9 versions.I think I got infected with a board game virus but hey, what can I say; my family/friends still love games the old-fashioned way...totally unplugged, board games and card games around the table.  On a side note I must share what happened during our game.  My daddy called and my sister held the phone out so he could hear my niece and me playing.  We had one part of the map covered and ready to explode with black Disease Cubes.  My niece was trying to tell me how I could (as the Medic) take care of all the blacks.  She said, ""Auntie, if you just get rid of all the blacks we won't die!  Can you just take care of all the blacks over there?"" and she pointed to the area that was well infected AND we were trying to treat/cure some the disease so that we could remove some the black Disease Cubes off the board and continue game play.  Later I dropped a Dorito on the map and I told my sister, ""Shay-Bo, I think I just killed everyone in Moscow because a large UFO has landed on them.""  We are a Christian family that doesn't drink, smoke, etc.  We just like to have good clean fun but I told my family if anyone was a fly on the wall during our game play they would have been questioning our integrity.  We have already planned our next family game day for Good Friday and yes, it will be good!!",5.0
545,B00A2HD40E,R2PFRNHCH7GTC9,"A classic, beloved co-op game","  Super fun to play with friends and definitely challenging. Pandemic is one of the most highly-rated board games around, and it lives up to the expectations. It offers strategic depth, a bit of random chance, and a compelling narrative to follow. It's also well balanced -- you can win if you do things right, but you'll lose a lot figuring out how to do so. Highly recommended for anyone new to board games or curious about co-op games in general.Pandemic Legacy is also pretty cool, but I'd say this is the better starting point. If you're going into Legacy, it's better to understand the core fundamentals of how to win at Pandemic as losing in Legacy has repercussions that reverberate through future games.",5.0
546,B00A2HD40E,RVNCVRSFR2L99,This game is hard,"  It a fun game where you and your friends work together to save the world.  The only thing I do not like about the game is the ending.  You spend about 45 min, but the game ends when you cure all the infections.  If you do manage to win, you still got a game board full of colors cubes.  I kind of wish the game came with more player cards to help the game go on longer and have the end be when you exterminated all infections vs just cure them.  Now this is a board game, so there nothing stopping you from just reshuffle the player deck and keep going until you clear the board.Over all it still a fun game and I highly recommend anyone to try it.

He actually can't wait for ""no netflix night"" and usually suggests we play this game.- It's a great cooperative style game. This is awesome for really competitive people who might want to play it a little safer and not risk tensions running too high.- It takes a while to learn. Some of the rules are not as readily apparent from the rule book, and your first game might take a while understanding all of it. For instance, our first game we thought the objective was to eradicate, but it's just to cure (multiple beers may have been involved tbh). Be patient and it'll seem second-nature after 1-2 games.- Fun balance of strategy and luck. I'm not a big fan of pure luck games, mainly because I have none. Some people might like that thrill. But I do like strategizing and coming up with (diabolical) game plans. This is a nice bit of both.- It's not easy to win. That's part of what makes it so fun. It's addicting because you might get so close, but come up short. Took us 5 games on the ""easy"" level to finally win.- Great for 2 or more people. We like games we can have fun with just the two of us (i.e. if you have no friends), or if you invite others. It's also nice because the pace of game-play does allow outside conversation, so you can interact with your friends on a game night, not just immerse in the game and not talk for hours.",5.0
548,B00A2HD40E,RIF1BD8NXWTTU,Helped kids with their fears about the current pandemic!,"  This is a very smart, very well thought out cooperative game that can be adjusted in difficult level.  I highly recommend it, despite the current circumstances, or perhaps especially in the current circumstances.  My kids conquered their fears about our pandemic when we played this game, and learned that many different professionals work together in cooperation to combat a virus.  They wanted to play it again and again, each time gaining confidence from beating the pandemic.  As an added plus, kids also learn the location and population density of many cities around the world.  Highly recommend!",5.0
549,B00A2HD40E,R3CECYXCHLZHQA,Super impressed. The board quality itself is really nice,"  I just received this the other day.  I want to say I am impressed with the quality.Starting with the box itself, I am very impressed. I've never got a board game before that was such heavyweight chipboard box.  Then the photo paper covering the box is very detailed, and rich full of color.  Lovely texture and coating on the box.  Super impressed.The board quality itself is really nice, looks, great!I like the clear plastic disease cubes, they are pretty crystal clear and to me it's more exciting and not as monotonous as the wooden ones that came  with the first edition.  I wouldn't of minded wooden pawns but I am not complaining.. they are fairly heavy plastic and polished a bit -- same with the research center tokens.Card quality is very nice.  Air cushioned and seems like they'd hold up.  I've already sleeved the player deck.  I might not sleeve the infection deck.  If it ever becomes a problem (I can always sleeve them later).",5.0
550,B003AIM52A,R2FMWWLZSG6VIK,My daughter loves this game,"  This game is great for family game nights. My 5 year old daughter loves it. The game came with 6 resizable headbands, a deck of picture cards, a small hourglass timer, playing chips, 3 ‚Äòsample questions‚Äô cards, and instructions. I like that a lot of people can participate, and it‚Äôs an easy game to play. I highly recommend this game for your little ones.***If helpful, please click ‚ÄòHelpful‚Äô*** :)",5.0
551,B003AIM52A,R26D7SBJPLHBDY,An actually fun game for almost all ages,"  I generally loathe board games, and when one of my in-laws drags them out I try to slip away or find an excuse not to play. But I watched a round of this, and jumped in and wanted to play! With a group of a dozen people aged 9-81 (those who didn't have headbands had to put their card face down and hold it up during their turn), we had a fantastic time playing this crazy game.So I ordered my own set to play with the 3 children I nanny for, and while they are a little young, and only one can read, I pre-selected easily recognizable cards and they caught on very quickly! I didn't use the timer for the little ones, because everyone gets to participate in everyone else's turn, so they don't get impatient. My only complain is that the newer cards, in the edition I purchased, have much more ""stylized"" illustrations on them, so there were some simple words that I had to pull from the deck, because the kids weren't likely to guess the right word.",5.0
552,B003AIM52A,R1Z2ZO00QI24VG,Great game for children albeit with limited replay value,"  Purchased this game as a Christmas present for my nephew. Finally had a chance to play it for the first time a few weeks ago. I was thinking it would be pretty easy for us adults playing a kids game, I was wrong. We played with 3 adults, a teenager, and a 6 year old. The 6 year old was able to do better than half the people! I think this speaks volumes to how good of a kids game this actually is. It can be equally challenging for everyone.The game play itself is a self guided question game. Everyone has a ""hedbanz"", which is just what they call their plastic headbands that are included with the game. Each player places a card on their respective hedbanz. Everyone can see your card, except you. Your card has an illustration in addition to the description of what it is. The game includes a card with sample questions, but my group of players found that most of those questions were useless on most of the cards. You begin the game with three playing chips in front of you and a timer. When the timer begins you ask yes or no questions about your card. If you guess your card correctly before the timer runs out you get to give up a playing chip and continue with a new card until the timer runs out. After that point play passes to the next player, while you keep the card that stumped you. You continue with this card until you guess it correctly. The first player to get rid of all three chips wins the game!The only reason I knocked off a star is due to the replay value. It seems there are about 50 cards that come with the came. If you play a round with 5 people those 50 cards do not go very far at all. With my group of 5 we went through approximately 10 cards during a session of this game. That means that after approximately 5 times playing this game you will begin to repeat cards. This will obviously hurt the replay value. Perhaps this is something that can be solved with an expansion at some point.",4.0
553,B003AIM52A,R1WYZFD74P86P9,So fun!,"  I'm a speech therapist and this game gets all of my students excited about speech.

Best of all, many of my students have this game at home so they can generalize their skills. Love it!",5.0
554,B003AIM52A,RDI45EH0NJ631,"Kids love it, easy and quick to get started, with endless opportunities to INNOVATE!","  How does it work?A headband on your head, holding a card with a picture that only the others can see.The person with the headband is to guess what's on the card.Why get it?Kids love it. This game is one of the first things my 8-year-old's friends pull out (and we have at least 40 board games) and want to play, every time they come over.Replay value?As other reviewers have pointed out, the replay value is limited due to a limited number of cards. That is if you play by the rules. There are so many ways to improvise with this game, and that includes adding different cards, making your own, attaching post-it notes to the cards.So if that's the case, why get it all?Because it makes you PLAY. We all have ideas about doing charades and 20-questions (Alexa makes us do that more often) but the beauty of this games is ITS SIMPLICITY. You pull it out. You get started in 2 minutes.It reminds you to PLAY.Anyone can play, and you can adjust for everyone's level. Great for learning how to think about sorting big amounts of data. Great for learning how to phrase questions. Great communication activity. Lots of laughters and fun.",5.0
555,B003AIM52A,R2G7808ZUTPD22,... of my daughter's speech therapist - she was doing great in the speech therapy office and said all of ...,"  We actually purchased this game at the recommendation of my daughter's speech therapist - she was doing great in the speech therapy office and said all of her sounds perfectly, because she was focused on it.  Her problem was when she was excited about something and talking too fast; all her sounds got jumbled and she was difficult to understand.  Playing this game helped her spontaneously use the proper sounds for each letter, because she was invested in playing and wanted to win AND be understood when giving clues.  Worked like a charm.  On top of it all, the whole family had fun playing this together.",5.0

The words weren't bad (one was ""bra.) but I wanted to avoid silly teenage giggles as much as possible.It is one of the most fun games the kids play. There are headbands for six, but you can use a regular head band across the forehead to hold a card and more kids can play. One boy put his cap on backwards and used the strap in the back to hold his card.We have played this with adults too and we end up laughing until we cry.Great game. Easy to play. Lots of fun.",5.0

My 3 year old loves it even though he plays it wrong and is always cheating but he gets the jist of it and has fun playing with me. my 7 and 9 year old kids play it and they both have fun. we tweaked the rules and don't use the chips to declare a winner, the kids like to keep going and have fun but the chips and timer are good to keep the games short when many are playing.",5.0

I wish I spoke Spanish, but unfortunately I do not. I thought at first that they must just include the cards in Spanish and English, which would be awesome! But NO, only the Spanish cards were provided. By the time I opened the box to play the game, 30 days had passed since I purchased it and I could not return it. I attempted to contact the maker of the game, just to request the cards in English. After emailing several pictures of the game box, the cards and the receipt from Amazon, I only got several very difficult to decipher emails from customer service, but no real assistance.

Now we have to play it all the time, and she always points out the ""Banz"" part, but she's in her 80's now, so whatever she enjoys, we enjoy. I'll have to post a photo of her.

The product was packaged well and it was delivered on time.I was not around when the game was played, but from what I have heard from other family members the kids like it a lot! They find it fun and engaging. The parents like the game, because it is an 'old school' group style of game, and not a solo video game. HedBanz is one of those games that promotes social interaction between kids and adults as well.I am looking forward to playing it!AMAZON IS THE BEST!When I originally purchased this Christmas gift on December 17th (along with another gift), they were delivered on time - but were stolen! I reported the robbery to the police, because that is what you are supposed to do. I, myself, put this matter at the bottom of the polices priorities.Then, I called AMAZON and explained the situation. AMAZON was very understanding and replaced this gift and the other, at no additional cost to me! They were both delivered in time for the holiday!

569,B003AIM52A,R2N3SYT93LELMF,"Cute, Fun, but PRICEY","  When I initially saw this game I thought of the Ellen show when she wears that ridiculous headband and her guests guess what the words are. I thought this would be a fun game for my girls and their friends to play-especially on those sleepover nights. The thing that many didn't like about this game that I actually was okay with was the fact that there are not a ton of cards and that the sand timer runs out quickly. I don't know about anyone else, but my children rarely play any of these games exactly as the directions recommend. I also teach and my students do the same thing with games in the classroom. They modify the games to suit the needs of the group. So when my children play this game, they extend the time. Actually they stopped using that timer and use a different timer we have in the house. They have also taken to using the headbands and making up their own cards to go on them to supplement the cards that come in the game. What I like about this game is the premise is simple enough that everyone gets the gist of the game quickly but the players are not bogged down in rules. The game can be modified without losing the point of the game. The thing I do take a bit of an issue with is the game's price point. I actually purchased this game prior to being offered it with Amazon Vine. I thought the premise of the game was different than the typical games and was looking for something fun to do for a girl's sleepover. However, at $20+ this is an expensive game! In this price point there should be more cards and the game should come with some sort of better timer device. Other than that, I do think this is a fun game and my children both at home and in school seem to really enjoy playing this.",4.0
570,B003AIM52A,R17BN9H4361JOR,Fun for adults too,"  This game is hilarious. My 4 yr old isn't old enough to guess/identify his own card, but he LOVES when adults ask him questions about their cards.

So this game is a good family compromise, if someone gets tired and wants to quit it's easy for the rest of us to either finish playing without them or all quit together.

We bought this for my daughter and I was excited to play it with her. We opened it and ugh! It doesn't have the 3d pieces, it has more career cards (which is fine), but I hate that it got rid of the toke Life cards, replaced them with a matching token for your car and then you use it to spin. You no longer get to chose 3 cards blindly, instead it is chose from the first two cards on top the deck. They have added a card category of vacation. Also added action cards. The action cards make this game HORRIBLE. On almost every spot that isn't a Payday, or baby, it is an action card. And everyone gets to spin the spinner to see how much money they can get. Essentially everyone gets a participant trophy after every turn. Yay *eye roll* anyway had I realized there was this many changes I wouldn't have bought this version and would have looked for an older version. Which I have already done, and purchased. Waiting on it's arrival. But seriously if you are getting nostalgic and thinking this is like the game you grew up playing, you are wrong. It isn't. This game really should be renamed because there is that many changes. Oh yeah and let's not forget about the trademarks for Travelocity. basically they have ruined this game!",1.0

I have tried fixing but it keeps going back to same position it came in.Second per picture above I recieved 2 pink cars...according to the cardboard place markers(picture above) one car should of been silver...which isnt a big deal. Until you have to girls playing and both want pink.

Life is a fun game because it doesn't quite start the fights you get from Monopoly or Risk. By the time you get to the end, everybody is pretty much ready to be done playing. The other thing is that even if you lose, you usually retire with several million dollars, so you figure you'll be okay. The only in game assault on another player is when they roll your magic number and you have to pay them 20k, or the occasional fine from an action card.

592,B06XY48MK1,R1YIW63GX7OJ1Z,Disappointing update to a formerly great game,"  The Game of Life has always been tremendous fun to play... until now.  This latest update to the game rushes you through a very short road from start to finish.  Without any real element of risk, in that there are very few penalty spaces that require you to lose money, it's essentially a contest to see who collects the most money a little bit at a time.  The numerous new occupations really don't mean much, as they're essentially salary cards that happen to have random job titles printed on them.  Essentially, this version of Life is a very pale imitation of what was once a tremendously fun game.  Unless young children are playing, you'll certainly enjoy older versions of the game much, much more.",2.0
593,B06XY48MK1,R1KKG8IEOZV6EF,Different than the original but ok,"  We had the older version of Life and this is quite different. It has a lot more interaction (when you get a life card a lot of times you have to ""duel"" other players).My biggest gripe is there weren't any $20k bills. You run out of $10k bills really fast because of the way things are paid. We took the bills out of the old game and made it work! Also, some of the rules are unclear (ie, when someone spins your number and you get paid, but what happens when 2 people have the same number?) And the spinner goes flying if you don't hang onto it. The little tokens that you put on your number get stuck in between the plastic and cardboard so we stopped using them after 1 time",3.0
594,B06XY48MK1,RVPC7H86R1Z9A,4 out of 5 for construction quality,"  This is a  game from my childhood.  We spent hours dreaming about who we'd be and where our paths might take us.  So far, we like the update! Pros: Easy to learn and easy to play for families of all ages. It appeals to my tweens who want to play all the time, game play isn't too long so no one loses patience.Cons: This game comes folded in 4's so you have seams to contend with. Chips are easily lost because they are translucent. The spinner isn't integrated in gameboard easily, so someone has to hold it in place while other players spin. The color wheel in the spinner moves around, making it difficult to tell which color you've landed on. overall, 4 out of 5 stars",4.0
595,B06XY48MK1,RMOUGFIQP5TCX,Not the original,  I much preferred the original game of life and was pretty disappointed.  This one has you pick up cards and do goofy things.

601,B06XY48MK1,R2QCTG2GWS729C,dissappointed,  I was excited to play this game with my kids.  Upon opening it I found that pieces were missing or nonfunctional. The spinner was a hot mess. It barely spins and its missing the stick that decides what number you land on. It also looks like it is missing a car. I am not a fan of this version. The spinner is supposed to clip onto the edge of the board but it doesn't stay when we spin. I think I'll be sending this back and looking for the older version of Life.,2.0
602,B06XY48MK1,R1Z5WKAKDDXJMJ,Cheaply made,"  We just received our game and were excited to open it up.  We are actually using this as a wedding gift and was planning on exchanging some of the fake money for real.  When I opened the box, I turned the spinner and noticed it did not spin.  I checked to see if there was something preventing it from spinning and realized that it was the plastic.  It is almost see through and the spinner won't even make a complete round.  I am super disappointed that Hasbro does not have a bit more quality control and pride in their products.  I am going to go to some used toy places and see if I can find an older but better quality board game.",1.0

My only complaint is the cash dividends are only 10‚Äôs, 50‚Äôs, 100‚Äôs, and 500‚Äôs so you constantly have to have everyone change their bills and the pegs for the cars are really cheap.  still gave 5 stars though!",5.0

My son enjoys it because of the many career and house options.  I feel that it is too easy to make money as you draw cards throughout the game.

This set is VERY well priced. We were amazed at the value of what we got and how much fun we had together. We went through every document and piece of evidence, took notes, made a timeline, deciphered the code, and correctly solved the murder! Definitely buying the Hunt A Killer subscription service; this is the perfect monthly date night.",5.0

The padlocked bag is not leather of any kind, but fabric.  You are given the solution in a sealed envelope, but I encourage you to look for help online if you get stuck.  There are a lot of folks who will be happy to help, without spoiling the whole game for you, you just need to ask.",5.0

Hunt a killer please continue to make more of these I will purchase every single one!I really did enjoy this much more then needing to purchase a 6 month series. It was just as enjoyable if not more plus I didn‚Äôt have to pay $140+ to get 6 boxes of stuff just to solve one case.They were very thorough and detailed and were still able to form a good story within this one box.It also includes a lot more items and materials then I was expecting so I was very pleased with that.I would love to see more of these in the future and also some other versions such as Empty Faces since I‚Äôm a huge paranormal fan.Can‚Äôt wait for the next one!,5.0

I‚Äôm giving away the game, so I set the combination to match the given clues so that the next person doesn‚Äôt have the same problem.The mystery is Immersive and creative, but the manufacturers error ruined the game flow.",1.0
614,B085ZNYPR3,R1NY8CO2777Y39,Riveting and entertaining,"  Super well done! If you‚Äôre on the fence of trying the subscription, grab this and see how you like it. I had so much fun and finished it in about 45 minutes. It was definitely challenging. If you‚Äôre not familiar it will probably take you longer. Since I already am familiar with ciphers that helped speed along my progress substantially. HAK killed it with this box and I can‚Äôt wait for them to do more like this.",5.0
615,B085ZNYPR3,R126XWUTE096PU,Enjoyed the game but the ending was anticlimactic,"  My husband and I solved this game and it was very fun, we may pass it to family and friends (since you can only use the game one time).  Took us a long time, especially the decoding, just that alone took us 1 hr and total it was about 3 hours.  We are extremely thorough though and would try to pick apart every single piece of evidence.  We had a sense of who it was earlier in the game before the coding though but wanted every last piece of evidence to fully PROVE who the killer was.  I think unfortunately it left us mildly unsatisfied at the end when we didn‚Äôt really get a full explanation, I was almost hoping for a play by play of what exactly happened that night during the murder but instead it was more so ‚Äúthis is who it is, they‚Äôre in jail‚Äù type situation.  I loved the details and how ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù every piece of evidence felt.  There was even some humor in the clues which was a good break up of some laughs in some ‚Äúserious‚Äù discovery.  All the details definitely made us think there would be a more detailed description at the end so we have no questions or ‚Äúhow did it fully happen‚Äù type scenarios in our heads.  Overall we would definitely get more though because the process was super fun, hoping the ending to future games is as detailed as the rest of the game.",4.0
616,B085ZNYPR3,R211SIIXW0V5HI,Fun and Engaging - But wrong code!,"  Purchased this game for date night and we had fun! We have a recurring subscription to the ""Hunt a Killer"" games, but got this one to fill the time ""in between"" our subscription boxes.Deducted stars only because the code on our bag was incorrect (didn't match the clues). We verified this by looking at their hint website afterwards. When we received the game, it was actually already set on what the CORRECT numbers should be though, so the bag automatically popped open without us having to try and guess anything, and we were able to finish the game. If it hadn't already been pre-set to the correct numbers, we wouldn't have been able to complete the game though since there were 3 crucial pieces of evidence in there. So that would have been understandably frustrating. Surprised to see that happen with the level of detail & quality that typically goes into their games, but we still enjoyed it despite that.",3.0
617,B085ZNYPR3,R29ZK97VR1NVQ3,I highly recommend this high quality immersive Murder Mystery Experience!,"  This is a WONDERFUL representation of the WORLD'S #1 Murder Mystery Company - Hunt A Killer!  I have investigated and solved mysteries of all varieties from Hunt A Killer, usually at a cost upward of $150, as a deluxe box set, a premium mystery, and as the classic subscription Mystery consisting of 6 episodes each.  I was very excited when I learned that this was being made available to a wider audience for a MUCH LOWER COST. At $30.00 - this is an amazing value and opportunity!  The high quality that is the Hunt a Killer reputation is 100% applicable to THIS Mystery despite the low cost.  I hope that people will utilize this Mystery to learn how wonderful the Hunt A Killer experience can be, perhaps as a ""test"" before committing to a long term subscription.  For those of us already aware of, and members of, the Hunt A Killer subscription family - utilize this opportunity to grab a fun quality mystery for your own enjoyment or as a gift. I don't know how, if you want to take your time and enjoy the experience, it could be solved in 45-60 minutes.  It took me hours to organize, investigate, and solve the mystery.  However, I was in no hurry and was taking my time, working alone, for pure enjoyment.",5.0
618,B085ZNYPR3,R2U422GXVRLV6,Loved it. LOVED IT.,"  Best date night we've had in forever! I give it a very, very strong recommendation. It's not so much a game as a series of clues you unravel to determine the murderer out of a number of suspects, and it was incredibly fun. You'll love it too if you're into serial killer / true crime stuff.  You read through a detailed list of suspects, pore through crime scene photos, figure out the combination to a locked case containing more clues, decipher codes, etc..This is just a one-off box they sell in stores but HUNT A KILLER is a subscription box that sends you a mystery each month and I think we're going to have to sign up for this. I figured something out towards the end that was such a delicious a-HAH moment that I need to chase that dragon for a while.",5.0

620,B085ZNYPR3,R3EEOZQRRX5IVW,Just As Fun As The Subscription Box,"  This game so much fun! It had the same quality of items as in the regular Hunt A Killer subscription boxes, but you could solve the murder in 1 hour rather than 6 months! =} Definitely use a pencil or other paper so you can gift the game to another  Murderino after you solve it as it‚Äôs really a one use game.",5.0
621,B085ZNYPR3,R23A9TGKB2R5LC,Great Way To Spend An Evening,"  This is our first time doing HAK. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and plan to get a subscription to continue.Pros:1. Great quality. The evidence is not cheesy, cheap, or lame.2. It‚Äôs a pretty good value. It‚Äôs about 2-3 hours to complete, not 45-60 min. It‚Äôs about the same price we‚Äôd spend on going to the movies.Cons:1. There isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúconfession‚Äù from the killer in the solution envelope that explains what happened that night. It‚Äôs just X did it and they are in jail.2. There was supposedly a clue in a photocopying a photo but it is impossible to see (others have commented on this in reviews as well). Fortunately, we figured out the ultimate takeaway from other evidence.",4.0
622,B085ZNYPR3,R16Z3CR0CBIB47,Warning- do not buy! Watch my video & read my review,  ¬†The main clues Which were inside of the locked bag could not be accessed because the lock on the bag was defaulted or set to the wrong code. We verified this by going to the death at the dive bar website and confirmed that about code was correct yet it still would not work no matter what we did. I would not suggest buying this game as you were left without important information to solve the crime,1.0
623,B085ZNYPR3,R17NM7Y2G3B5UI,Very clever and well done,"  I've done virtually everything this company has produced, so I was already familiar with their products. This is a particularly nicely done example, though. The quality is very high, the story is good, and the mystery/puzzle aspect is clever and multi-layered. You have to do puzzles, but you also have to think and process. It's very well orchestrated. My only minor complaint is that in one image, it's hard to see the thing you're supposed to see. I'd like to see HAK put out more of these.",5.0
624,B085ZNYPR3,R1XVCQWE5ZPL5V,So much fun!,"  I've been hesitant to do the full subscription, so I figured I would start with the box game. I absolutely loves it! I played with 3 friends and it was very challenging. The box says 1 hour....it took us about 3. It's so cool that there are actual items and locks to crack in the box. I want them to make more of these games! So freaking cool. The only sad part is you can only play once, so I passed it on to some other friends so they can play too!",5.0
625,B085ZNYPR3,R28OM7Q53675DH,Totally worth it and so fun!,"  So let‚Äôs start by saying this was so entertaining! My 4 girlfriends and I poured over this while having drinks. We got serious about solving it but still able to laugh, crack jokes, and have a good time. It‚Äôs a fake crime after all... but SO well thought out and you really had to pick it apart to solve but it wasn‚Äôt so tough that it was over our tipsy heads. I was unsure of getting this for a girls weekend.. but it‚Äôs totally perfect for that. You don‚Äôt have to be into crime solving to want to crack this case. It reminded us of an escape room you can do right in your home. One thing I would complain about is that our code bag was broke .. we had discovered the correct code in the first 20 min and it was jammed .. so we thought it was wrong.. didn‚Äôt discover this for over an hour .. but honestly with that broken bag it was still a great time. You won‚Äôt regret getting this.",5.0
626,B085ZNYPR3,RN0WL8QDBAWC4,Fun One Time Play,"  This was fun, a little challenging, cool puzzles. We had a great time playing. Only downside to keep in mind is you only play once. This isn't a game you can go back to. After we played we passed it on to family who likes mysteries and games. They loved it too. After playing they passed it on to a friend. It's a great game to play and pass on. It's priced as a one time game, but if you want something you can go back to or want repeated play, this isn't the right game for you. But if you like mysteries, solving puzzles, and active game play, you'll enjoy this game.",5.0
627,B085ZNYPR3,R3ASQ9SQC902KA,Final reveal leaves questions,"  Great game and a lot of fun, but I was hoping the big reveal would tell the true story and give the means, motive, opportunity to tie up all loose ends and finish the story. Instead it just gave you the name of the person who did it. We had a lot of fun solving the case but we still had a lot of questions that we‚Äôre talking about a day later and we wish there were some answers by the writers of the game.",5.0
628,B085ZNYPR3,R25DWRKCIAYXLM,Amazing experience in a box!,"  My husband and I loved this! It is a murder mystery in a box. You get a huge amount of realistic looking ‚Äúevidence‚Äù and are takes with solving a murder. No spoilers but when we realized who it was- it was exhilarating! There are a few codes to break, but mostly you look through the paperwork, news article, photographs, etc. to determine who did it!",5.0

Thankfully since it was already on the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù numbers, we were still able to get into the bag. We looked through every piece of evidence trying to find the ‚Äúdeeper meaning‚Äù because it seemed too obvious at first glance. Nope - nothing more to see/find. We spend THREE hours trying to figure out what we were missing, so we definitely felt like we wasted a lot of time for nothing. We had wanted to try the subscription, but if the boxes are all like this, we won‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs too bad - we really looked forward to this.",1.0
631,B085ZNYPR3,R10AYQ1NM2KS4Z,Fun for a group,  I subscribe to the monthly boxes so I knew they put together good games.

632,B085ZNYPR3,R2WC83DWLY165F,A fun way to KILL some time,  This was a fun little game. It is very similar to Unsolved Case Files but sleeker. There was a good amount of information to sift through and a nice variety as well. My one criticism is the lack of a information on how the crime was committed. It confirms the killers but not many details of the crime itself.Overall a great game. It made me want to play other Hunt a Killer games. I hope they continue to make these.,5.0
633,B085ZNYPR3,RS88N8RWF72VE,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,"  This game was going great, until we tried multiple times to open the locked bag and were unsuccessful. After multiple attempts we decided to use the clues/hints to determine what the lock was and it was something we had tried MULTIPLE TIMES and the bag STILL WOULD NOT OPEN. To spend the money that I did on this game for the lock to not be set appropriately is ridiculous. Now we have to try and pop the lock open somehow to determine what clues we have missed because we want to finish the game that we paid for.Word to the wise, don‚Äôt buy this game because the lock may not be set correctly and you can‚Äôt finish the game unless you break in to it.",1.0

I had two girl friends with me and not only were we blown away with the quality of the product, but the detail to the texture of the evidence, the fact that the evidence went the extra mile to make you feel like you were actually solving a murder, everything about this game is worth the cost!I would recommend this game to anyone who has the interest in murder mysteries! The only downfall? You can only play once.",5.0
638,B085ZNYPR3,RP3QV0ZCKN4KU,Immersive and exciting experience with incredible value for the money,  Such a fun adventure! We had a great time and it definitely took us longer than an hour that the box says - probably more like 3 or 4 (there may or not have been wine involved so that could have contributed) but we really dove deep into the evidence. Super high quality items included and the solution is very satisfying. All of the evidence and puzzles were challenging but not frustratingly so. Plus there are spoiler free hints online to help if you get completely stuck. Absolutely positively recommended and I‚Äôm for sure signing up for a subscription box now!!!,5.0

The pictures ensure that my younger daughter (with Apraxia) can still independently play, while it encourages both my children to read aloud the object. This game requires no adult help, so my daughters will literally spend hours playing this game together. It is super sturdy game with thick, sturdy, double sided cardboard bingo cards and the text and pictures on the yellow ‚Äúchips‚Äù have no scratching or fading from frequent overuse; we do have problems sticking the discarded yellow chips back in on one side of the Zingo machine if it‚Äôs not placed in the slot *just so*, but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs from an overzealous preschooler and not the manufacturer.

Zingo has been a great alternative.  I would just recommend one change:  have some Zingo cards with the actual numbers on them.  I know they're trying to reinforce counting, but some of the objects on the card they are supposed to count are spaced too closely together and get confusing for little one to count.  We just made our own cards with numbers to get around this.",4.0
643,B01DY818JG,R1P8RVB9J1BDEL,"Fun for small kids, mechanism works well, beware of missing tiles","  My kids love this. We got our first set as a gift. I bought this one as a spare because it was quickly clear that my 4-year-old twins were going to destroy the original set. That's OK. The game held up well, and the tiles are easy for kids to lose. The ""Zinger"" mechanism works very well; we have rarely had problems with it, and it works for the kids playing independently. But the new set came with a couple surprises. It's 7-player, 78-tiles instead of 6-player 72-tiles. So the cards are different, which is a surprise. But not a big problem.What was a surprise is that my new set is short 2 tiles. I got only 76. (If you care to do an inventory, there should be 3 of every tile.) So I'm a little short on spares.For small kids, this is a great toy, but I think the quality control could be improved.",3.0
644,B01DY818JG,RHTQS4IN292VQ,A must have for special needs classrooms!,"  I love all Zingo games; I now have three of them. I use them with my students with autism, ages 6-8. It is a great language tool. It helps with fine motor skills. Students have to put the pieces back into the slot if no one has the item. They have to use a pincher grip to push it in and there is a little tension so they have to push a little bit. We had to teach them to put them in correctly, but they caught on quick. I am not sure what it is but the act of pushing the game piece in is reinforcing and they love to do it. This is great for my kids who have weakness in their hands. It also helps with motor planning. Students also take turns being the number caller. This allows for independence in game playing. Students learn their numbers, identifyinghow many objects are in a group, addition using pictures, and number words. A lot can be taught with this one little game.",5.0

It is always good for us to take school work out of the equation,  and just make it fun!2) the format is easy and keeps the game compact and neat. We have the traditional zing as well, and this is great. If you get a card you don't need, simply slip it back into the dispenser using the sits on the top.3) the game is 100% words,  so kids learn what the sight words are. There are some tiny symbols, but not really pictures.Cons:No big cons. We love zingo games. The only thing that makes it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish there were more sight words in the game, or they had two card and tile sets. Not a deal breaker, but something to note.",4.0
647,B01DY818JG,R3JBXQTN3CNXLP,the perfect game for your toddler,"  this is one of the only toys I have ever bought for my kid that I actually enjoy playing with with her.  she loves it because she gets a kick out of the dispenser contraption and she loves the individual attention of playing a game with adults.  the fact that it is so simple to play (don't need to read any directions) and isn't mind-numbingly boring for adults is what makes this the perfect toy.  my child is 3.5 and I wish I had bought it for her sooner, but she can play it easily at her current age.",5.0
648,B01DY818JG,R2AOCZ4CDNHH8V,My Students LOVED This Game,"  At the time of this review I taught ""regular"" first grade students.  My students were on various levels (Pre-K through 2nd) when it came to reading.  One of the most difficult tasks of teaching can be making learning fun.  I found this game on Amazon and thought it might be a good addition to my small group teaching time (after a structured lesson).  The result?  ALL of my students fell in love with this game.  They would often ask to play it during their small group reading time if we had time left at the end of the lesson.  There are two sides to each card; however, even my students who were below grade level could use the ""harder"" side of the card.  The key part of this is to have the students read the word (or try to read the word) before getting the word chip.  Even though they are sight words I found it essential to help the student try to figure out the word to ensure success.  Rather than only get three in a row I often played the game where the entire card had to be filled.  At the end of the game I would always reward the students with a pencil, eraser, ticket, etc... whether or not they won.  That avoided anybody feeling like they lost.  It didn't ever delete the motivation to play because each student still wanted to win.If you want to make learning fun, try this game.",5.0
649,B01DY818JG,R1QAM9T81JVLT0,Not that useful - Only 24 words & cards have picture clues,"  Ok for a little practice but not that useful.  Not really worth $25.The game has ONLY 24 WORD tiles.  I read in the description that it had 72 tiles, but didn‚Äôt realize there are 3 of each (which I understand for the game purpose if you‚Äôre playing with multiple people but they need to provide more tiles with more words).My child just completed Kindergarten and they were expected to read a list of 100 words.  He needs more practice on some so a classmate‚Äôs parent recommended this game.  But these tiles only represent 1/4 of the words he needs to know to start first grade (and we haven‚Äôt played yet for me to see if they are the words he knows already or not...)Also, the cards have TOO MANY PICTURE CLUES.  This makes it easier for the child to use the picture as a reminder/prompt versus truly recall/read the word, which is the point of sight words.  There should be another version on the back of the cards with words only.  This would help because when assessed in Kindergarten they have 3 seconds to read the word to prove they know it (no picture clue or time to sound it out).Another idea would be to sell a ‚Äúrefill kit‚Äù if you already have the original Zingo (which we really liked so this is sad!). I keep the tiles in a snack-size zippered plastic bag to prevent them from getting lost, so I could just use the same red dispenser if the refill kit came with tiles and cards only.  This would make the product cheaper and easier to package/ship.  And if they couldn‚Äôt add more than 72 tiles in one set, they could offer different refill sets with more words.",1.0
650,B01DY818JG,R2L5UDZQD9E559,Great game for kids & adults of all ages & capability levels/ including special needs children!,"  I bought this game for my girls when they were 5 & 3, 13 years ago... we used it for years! Now we use it with younger cousins! We are keeping our game for grandchildren, but I bought another to gift to my niece who has Downs‚Äô Syndrome, because she loves playing it, and the concept is easy enough for her to grasp with special needs, yet still a challenge for her. We have a great time playing this with adults and children of all ages in our family! It is like bingo, but you match the picture of the tile to the picture on your board. Also, there is a cool device to deal the tiles so that everyone can play, even the dealer! It can be played with 2 people or many more! I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a game that is inclusive for many different capability levels! You can all play, and have a great time without feeling like someone didn‚Äôt get a fair shot! Also, it helps kids learn. So, any educational game is a plus in my book!",5.0
651,B01DY818JG,R2PU0CES39MJC9,Not sure if counterfeit...?,"  Not sure if this product is counterfeit but the instructions clearly state repeatedly that the sight words zingo has two sided tiles for easier and harder play. Mine are uniformly yellow, and printed the same word front and back. Clearly this is not as good as a game with two levels of play...and worse it‚Äôs inconsistent with its own instructions which makes me think it is maybe a lower quality knock off / counterfeit?",1.0
652,B01DY818JG,R3PHPBC3K7WXBO,Great for toddlers,  I absolutely love this game.  It assists my 3 year old with recognizing various items and also starts with sight words.  It is an added bonus that he loves yelling bingo!  The red cards are more competitive and nice for older ages.  The green cards have less duplication so theyre less competitive.  We try to stay on the green side with my 3 year old.  Id definitely recommend this item.,5.0
653,B01DY818JG,RNWADW3UCG9UQ,We love Zingo!,"  My parents got the original picture Zingo for our 4 year old daughter and it's been a huge hit.  When I saw that there was a word building version, we had to have it for her as well.  There's no setup required like punching out pieces or assembling anything, it's ready to go when you take it out of the box.  I like that there are two sides to the cards so younger children can play the easy side and older children and adults can play the harder side to make play a little more evenly matched.  The tiles are sturdy plastic so you don't have to worry about them bending them or ruining them by getting them wet or anything, plus they're double sided, so no need to put them into the Zinger 'right side up'.  The letters on the tiles and cards are also colored red for vowels and black for consonants.  This makes it easy to explain to younger kids that on the 'easy' side of the cards, you need 2 black letters and 1 red letter for each word.  The 'Zinger' is the hard plastic house that the tiles live in and are dispensed from.  The top slides easily forward and back to drop two tiles into the little grooves each time.  Then you slide the tiles back into as lot in the top if not needed with a satisfying little click sound.  Another nice feature is all the pieces fit easily back in the sturdy game box without taking anything apart!  Our 4 year old picked up the game quickly even though she's averse to spelling and reading and it gets her to sound out the words on her own because she wants to beat Mommy!",5.0
654,B01DY818JG,R3CN9Q6C8HXKZ7,He plays again and again and again and again,"  We've owned zingo for two days now. Roughly 67 rounds later I think it's safe to say my son, almost 4, loves it. I have nothing but good things to say... the tile dispenser runs smoothly, the game is simple and fun for preschoolers. With zero learning curve, he enjoyed it straight out of the box.I understand from my sister, whose kids are now 14 & 11, that the game has been improved since early versions with the picture on both sides of the tile, so no blanks are dispensed or extra time spent ensuring everything is face up when resetting the game.",5.0
655,B01DY818JG,RT5M44CU3WHBF,lots of fun but could include more sight words,"  I got this for my daughter, who is in kindergarten, who is really struggling with learning her sight words and does not enjoy flash cards.  We are not to the point to play the game as instructed, instead we are just popping the plastic chips out of the word dispenser and reading them together and then trying to find the match on our cards.  My 4 year old is also joining in, once again more as a matching game as she can't read these words yet either.  They like sliding the word dispenser and popping the plastic chips back in if there's no match.  There are six cards and all are printed front and back for the choice of twelve cards (the game says the green side is less competitive and the red side is more competitive), and there are nine words on each card.  Here are my reasons for 4 stars:  The sight words that are reviewed are as follows: and, are, come, for, have, here, in, me, my, now, our, said, she, the, there, they, three, two, want, we, went, what, where, who.  Being there are only 24 words, and in kindergarten (at least at my daughter's school) she is learning 50, so I wish there were more words to learn in the game (like the word ""she"" is played but not the word ""he"")  Also the word ""she"" is only on one out of the twelve cards; it seems that some words are focused on more than others.  So while I still find this game is helpful, the girls find it fun, and it was very easy to set-up and learn, I do wish it was more in-depth.",4.0

657,B01DY818JG,R1P5JAG3KIPXJJ,Fun game and can be great learning game,"  I really enjoy this game for a few reasons, which follow:-My kids love playing it- It's teaching my youngest (3) to pay attention (he gets upset when he misses one but he's learning to pay closer attention, I feel like it's helping with his attention span)- It's teaching them object recognition as well as word recognition - When they get an image I have them spell the letters and say the word.- When they have a space that matches a shown tile we have them ask politely for the tile, after a few times playing this way it has really helped with getting them to sit still during gameplay and it also enforces using manners when requesting something (please) and receiving something (thank you).I deducted one star because sometimes it dispenses 2 tiles out of the same space and gets stuck - this is annoying and slows down the game because then I have to fidget with it to get the tiles out. Not a deal-breaker just annoying.",4.0

It teaches them patience while waiting a turn, as well as numbers, letters, sight words/pictures, and it is very easy to operate. I have 3 kids 2, 4, 6 - and they all love playing this game together. My 2 year old does lose interest by the end, but that is expected for her age. She does have a fun time for the first 15-20 minutes though. My boys think this is the greatest game though, and it is one you can play with the whole family.",5.0

Child can match the words from the word chips to the pictures/words on the board, even if they don't know how to spell.2. A game that can go at any pace for any 4 year old and older.3. A great learning too for someone learning to read.4. Fun for anyone 4 years and older.5. Game is pretty sturdy and well made.  Boards could get bent up if someone tried to do that, but otherwise they are good quality.

The game is so easy to learn- my 4 year old picked it up just as fast as the adults did...and has even been beating us.

He is able to lead the game on his own because of how easy and intuitive it is. The parts are all safe to have around with my 10 month old, except the cards do get wrinkles if they‚Äôre chewed on. Perhaps plastic Zingo cards like what the little ‚Äúcall‚Äù cards are made of?  Plus, because there are a lot of ‚Äúcall‚Äù cards I can see how these might get spread out around the house and would not be fun to pick up after a while. Just a thought.

You get a card and you have to match the tiles to the pictures on your card. Maybe there are too many tiles but it seems like the same tiles always shows up and the game just drags looking for the last one.

670,B00U26V4VQ,R3E47I7A1FDE6C,Fantastic for a base game; definitely look into expansions!,"  This is the base game.  I can't emphasize that enough.  This review will only handle the base game, minus expansions.LEARNING CURVE:  This game is extraordinarily simple and straightforward to learn.  Played once through, it makes plenty of sense and opens doors to more complex rules and gameplay.GAME SPEED:  1-2 hours for 4 players.  Game moves briskly but with obvious early-, mid-, and end-game stages that each have their own strategies and approaches.  Game easily resumed from a paused state if you take a break.GAMEPLAY OVERALL:  Catan is satisfying to play, even more satisfying to win.  As a game best played with a poker face and a good set of bluffing skills, Catan rewards long-term foresight and strategies more than rushed or brute-forced gameplay techniques.  Catan can become repetitive IF and ONLY IF you refuse to play randomly.  I highly recommend players who have a few games under their belt learn to completely randomize the map, starting positions, and resource entitlement for more satisfying experiences.APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS?  Depends on your child.  Children with a knack for puzzles and strategy games will find playing Catan with adults to be very rewarding.  Probably a bit too complex for children to play with each other, however; too many ""honor system"" concepts in play, too easy to cheat each other.APPROPRIATE FOR SPECIAL NEEDS?  Gameplay can easily be catered for adults or children with special needs.  Game rules are insanely simple and easily modified for those wanting additional assistance.  Communities online for adapting Catan gameplay are prevalent and easily found.CONCLUSION:  Catan is a fantastically easy game to pick up and learn, but complex and difficult to master.  Catan is a game best suited to be expanded and enhanced, as the base game is truly just the first step into the world of Catan.",4.0

But look at the photographs attached (pirate copy on the right) and you will see misspellings all over the back of the box like 'strart by revealing Catan's' and 'No two games ard the same.'

673,B00U26V4VQ,R1Z4LWD3L0MSKA,"The ""Candy Land"" of Strategy Games","  I like it, but it's not quite a five-star game for me because I've since discovered other games which I enjoy playing more than this one.Pros:- Popular enough that many people already know how to play, and easy enough to teach those who don't- ""Gateway"" game for empire-building and resource management types of games- Involves some strategy and risk managementCons:- Winner/loser inertia: As you build more things, your production tends to accelerate. If you fall behind, it becomes progressively harder to catch up.- Occasional ""dead"" turns: Sometimes a player's turn consists of rolling the dice and nothing else, because they didn't get any resources since their last turn. Two of those in a row makes it difficult to stay engaged, and it's more likely to happen early in the game when that matters most.- Dice rolls dominate the game: The best-laid strategies can be overpowered by a stretch of reasonably bad luck.In my opinion, Ticket to Ride or Splendor would both be superior options for a ""gateway"" game, because they both offer greater strategic depth, faster gameplay, easier setup, simpler rules, and comparable price. Both of those games also have plenty of randomness, but in both cases, you're still playing and engaged on every turn, even when luck isn't on your side.The relatively recent Explorers and Pirates expansion to Catan fixes many of my issues with the game, but that expansion is basically a new game which uses some of the original components and game mechanics, and it's significantly more expensive.",4.0

It arrived yesterday and when I opened it up the quality of the game was in terrible condition. The board edges don't even fit together properly making the game hard to setup and the hexagons are poorly cut and do not fit inside properly. I have to force the sides and hexagons in to get them to stay together. Some of the hexagons are printed poorly as well as you can see in the pictures. The pieces that came with it were in terrible condition as well, several roads were chipped and looked like they were cut in half and several of the house/cities were chipped and don't even stand up. I also was sent a yellow set of pieces which is supposed to be orange, and the yellow set was missing 3 roads as there is supposed to be 15 roads per color.

675,B00U26V4VQ,R35YB0W197F4YS,"Game missing pieces, composed of mismatched version of components, QC issues","  Good game but seller provided a mismatched set, with missing pieces.It looks like this set might have been composed of spare parts harvested from different batches or used sets. I think this because about half the cards are slightly off-color. Not a big deal.The second problem is that the outer board pieces do not connect properly. Regardless of whether they are joined end-to-end according to the printed numbers or not, the pieces just do not fit together. We have to play with the outer tiles disconnected in one place so that the resource tiles will all fit in. Not a huge deal but pretty disappointing considering I purchased this as ""new"" and expected it to work completely.The third problem is that the white player's five settlements are missing. We play with small white beads instead. Disappointing.One last minor issue is that since the compentents are from mismatched sets, we have a yellow player but an orange reference card.

676,B00U26V4VQ,RRVWA3273HC8V,Best family game out there!,"  My family loves this game! I also purchased the Catan 5-6 Player Extension - 5th Edition, and the Catan Scenarios Helpers of Catan card pack. Together they make endless hours of fun for us and the kids. The game involves strategy, making trade deals, and there are several ways to win. Each of my kids has their own strategy to win and it's fun to see them learning about honesty, shrewd bargaining, and exploring new ways to try to win. Another thing I like about Settlers of Catan is it's more about achieving a personal goal than ""beating"" the other players; the first person to get 10 ""Victory Points"" is the winner. The rules are easy to learn, but mastery of the game takes a long time. This is a great alternative to having the kids play video games or use their ""devices"". Worth every penny, the game pieces are well made and look great. Definitely add this game to your family's game collection!",5.0

Check your game pieces and make sure you have the proper number of pieces,"  The game looks like fun but the instructions are woefully inadequate and assume and awful lot of knowledge for first time players. We had to go online and do a tutorial before we could figure out how to play. We would have preferred to be able to have enough instructions to be able to play right away or at least know in advance that we'd have to go online and do a tutorial.Also the game was in brand new packaging with missing pieces which made understanding the directions even more difficult. We thought we new what the road pieces were but the instructions said to take 15 of them in your color. Since there were only 14 of the orange and the blue pieces, this made it even more confusing and more difficult to get started. We had to paint two of the extra red and white pieces (we had 16 each of them) before we could get started.At this point, we still haven't been able to actually play the game since we're still learning how to get started.Once we watched a tutorial and figure out how to play, it was a lot of fun and we're looking forward to getting better at strategy.",3.0
678,B00U26V4VQ,R26A8B7W64NXIY,Fun game,"  So maybe we all know about Catan already, so I'm not going to do an extensive review. If you're wondering if this is the game for you, I'll give you two answers:1. If you're a very competitive gamer and like Eurogames, you'll really like Catan.2. If you're not a very competitive player but still like Eurogames, change a few of the rules and you'll still really like Catan.If you don't like Eurogames, you may not like this. The game revolves around you strategizing placement of buildings and roads to earn more resources to build more buildings and roads to achieve a determined set number of points to win. How much you compete with/against other players is kind of based on each player's personality. I don't like games where players try to sabotage one another, so I hate playing this game with certain types of people; on the other hand, when playing with people like me, we have a great time playing and competing for the goal without trying to sabotage the other.I really like this game and think it has a lot of replayability, especially when you throw in the expansions. Are there rules I would change? Yes, and I do every time I play, and I enjoy it every time. Just watch out who you're playing with! ;)",5.0
679,B00U26V4VQ,R1NOFXGE10NDP,Removing the individual pieces resulted in a number of pieces ripping (note that I took great care in removing them),"  I am extremely upset with my purchase. The overall quality of what I received would be barely worth $10, much less $45. To start out, the game box came damaged around the corners and edges. Removing the individual pieces resulted in a number of pieces ripping (note that I took great care in removing them). NOTHING is uniform: the roads are cut horribly and look more like my attempts at arts and crafts in kindergarten; I received three complete sets of red, orange, and white settlements, cities, and roads, but my fourth set consists of 4 yellow cities, 5 orange(!!!) settlements, and 15 blue roads. Is that something I can fix with a paint brush? You bet. Should I have to fix the pieces of a newly purchased game? Absolutely not. Additionally, 2/4 white cities are discolored and poorly cut.I've grown to love Catan and will be moving out of state soon, so I felt that it was time to purchase the game for myself since I won't be able to mooch of friends any longer. I had hoped this $45 purchase would allow me to bring the joy of the game to my new home and share it with new friends; I will not be able to do that with this set.A warning/suggestion: buy directly from the company that makes the game, not from Amazon.**EDIT:After further inspection, the border pieces also do not fit together properly.",1.0

681,B00U26V4VQ,R10ZL0KJSTKBQ6,UPDATE: Video - Great Gift for Many Occasions - Read Why!,"  ¬†Catan is the gateway board game for many. That's a good thing because game nights seem to be the thing more and more people are doing. I love Catan, I think this game is well balanced, easy to learn and really fun to play. I've gotten friends and family members who've only ever played games such as Card Against Humanity to not only play, but truly enjoy it.As mentioned the game is easy to pick up and the rules are straight forward. I typically recommend watching a YouTube video about the rules if no one in the group has played. There are some great videos under 10 minutes explaining all the rules.Setting up the game takes only a few minutes. Although, when the game is brand new it will take just as bit longer as you have to open everything for the first time. Ahh new game smell!It's highly recommend that you play on a flat surface and on a table when possible. There are a decent amount of pieces overall. Bags are included to put all the pieces away at the end.This game makes such a great gift for many occasions such as a birthday, anniversary, Christmas, Valentine's, or even just because!There are expansions to the game as well, but this original game is a solid start to what very well could become an addiction.If you found this review helpful, make sure to hit that 'helpful' button down below.",5.0
682,B00U26V4VQ,R2E51T8N6884C7,Great Family Game,"  Why my family and I like the Game:Great game for 3 to 4 players, we even like the game with only 2 people, but 3 or 4 is better.  The game cannot go on forever in a stale mate type situation, once you get your first couple of games out of the way the games usually take about 12 to 15 minutes per player to finish.  3 player game once experienced should take about 45 minutes.  The game board can be set up differently every time you play, this allows a different game each time and for players to employ different strategies.  I love the solid feeling game pieces.  The game is made very well which makes it more enjoyable to us and gives us a stronger desire to keep the game in good condition.Cons:Setup takes longer than the average board game.  still less than 5 minutes but hey, I wanted to write something under con.  The really only con i see to this game is that you are limited to four players or less unless you buy the expansion pack.Summary:Great game for people who like board games that involve some strategy.  We play with people who range in age from 8 to 72, enjoyable for all so far.  We put in about 10 games the first weekend we finally opened the box!",5.0
683,B00U26V4VQ,R26JTH5RYLQVZU,This game is a blast!,"  LOVE this game!  We quickly learned the rules which, to my old head at least, at first sounded rather complicated - it's anything BUT.  Lots of fun to get the family around a board game again, and away from the video games and cell phones.  The strategy is simple: collect resource cards (sheep, brick, stone, straw, and lumber) in order to build settlements, expand roads, and eventually build cities.  Resources can be traded with other players and rewards can be claimed (longest road, largest ""army"") and as you work your way through the process of developing the land, the first player to reach ten points wins.  This is perfect for three to four players; five or more players can play as well, but the game play is pretty crowded and fast at that point, so you would be well advised to purchase the extension pack at that point.My initial thought when looking at this game was that the price seemed a bit high for what I thought was a complicated Parcheesi (hah!) but we played a couple of games with my daughter and son-in-law, and we were hooked.  Set aside an hour or two for a game, but don't be surprised to find you've spent six hours on three or four games.  It's addicting, and it's a blast.",5.0
684,B00U26V4VQ,R23CB85JHLZF4S,You don't need to be a nerd to enjoy this game,"  I was introduced to this game in college and loved it. I recently bought it for my new family. My parents love playing it with me. My husband who does not like playing board games seemed to tolerate it fairly well.Things I love:Bartering. You can trade with other people in the game to get a better trade deal than the standard. I love this! In college I even tried to barter things outside of the game to get what I wanted, which was extremely pleasing to me and very displeasing to the German who wasn't a part of the deal. I love this part. Will it help you out or boost another player's ability to build...can you get a better rate or stick to trying to get a better rate through building. LOVE THIS part.I like building things. It is fun. Less frustrating than ticket to ride where you feel completely devastated if someone cuts you off from your intended route.Thorough rules. I hate it when the game doesn't tell you what to do in a situation. And then there is an online community to tell you too if you are doing it wrong. lol.Every time is different.Things I don't like:It looks a little daunting and confusing at first. So new time players are a little less hesitant to play with you.",5.0
685,B00U26V4VQ,R1103CI81Y91JN,Avoid! Counterfeit version of Catan,"  A very impressive, but still definitely counterfeit version of Catan. The border pieces are slightly wrong so that the playing tiles are loose. Only someone who had never played Catan could consider this acceptable. The wooden pieces fall between the tiles and the whole board moves constantly. It is so annoying when playing the game, and I am very unhappy. The playing cards are also noticeably thinner than they are supposed to be and the colors are slightly different (compared with the genuine 5-6 player expansion that I got from 3rd party seller Shopville.com).I contacted Asmodee, with photos (that I can't seem to attached here) and they confirmed that it is a counterfeit version.

It takes a couple of games to understand the concept and a few games to fully know how to play it. So far my 7 year old nephew and 78 year old grandma have been able to understand the game. It's fun playing the base game but with the 6 player expansion it becomes even better. Every game the board gets shifted around so you're always playing with a new board which requires different strategies to play. I would really recommend this game to anyone that would like to try a new board game. So far we've given away 3 copies and another 4 families have bought it after playing it with us.Pros:Replay value is greatNot difficult to learnUp to 6 players with expansionCons:Can take an 1-1.5 hrs to play a game depending on how many people are playing and how slow they areBoard pieces are made of cardboard and can be easily damaged,5.0

Before sitting down to play, you have to separate each of the many game pieces. Be careful here and read the advice in the pamphlets that come with the game to prevent damaging the cardboard/paper pieces. I recommend that you sit with some YouTube videos on game play to understand how the game flows. We tried initially through just reading the documentation. It was ok, but once we watched a video we realized we mis-read some sections and the game flowed much better after the video. We have only played the game with the standard configuration (which balances the board), but there is the option to randomize the tiles. I think we will be moving to the randomized version to mix up the starting strategies the players keep repeating. Love that there are player expansion options available for purchase, as well.",5.0

But to get the resources- ah here is where the strategy is- the factors are 1. putting yourself in squares where the chances of rolling that number on dice is high and also figuring out what resources is best to monopolize to and where to build near to, so that one can expand easily. Great game for ages 12 and older- may be a little trickier for those who are younger. Does not require much language understanding and can be learned within 1 game.",5.0

Read On for Game Tips and House Rules from a Life-Long Fan,"  (Off-the-bat Disclaimer: When you open up the box containing your Catan game, I'm afraid that it won't contain the Lego Catan board displayed in my photos. The photos represent a Lego creation that I made on my own for fun. I figured there were enough photos of the actual game pieces attached to other reviews, and that nothing else could better showcase how much I absolutely love this game!)I have played Catan hundreds and hundreds of times over the years, ever since my parents first ordered it when I was a child. Now I love playing it with my wife and family friends, and we even maintain a long-term score sheet to keep track of who has won the most games, and how many points each of us won per game (see photo). I am a full-on unashamed ""Catan Supernerd"", and look forward to playing it hundreds of more times. Here are some highlights:BRIEF SYNOPSIS: In this game, you and your fellow players assume the roles of rival bands of settlers who are racing to populate and develop the island of Catan. You strategically choose where to place your first settlements, based on what resources you can expect to harvest/mine from the surrounding countryside, and expand from there! However, to fully expand your influence on the island, you need to engage in resource trades with other players to strengthen your army, build roads, and construct settlements and cities. The game ends when one player accumulates 10 points and earns the coveted title of ""Settler of Catan!""AGE RANGE: 8-108. Easy to learn for all ages!TIME TO PLAY: 60 minutes for beginners (or games with ""really bad islands"" [only a few wood/ore/brick available]), but can go as quick as 30 minutes for experienced players.BEST ELEMENTS OF GAMEPLAY:-Simplicity: Probably my favorite thing about Catan is that it's so simple, but its randomness (discussed below) makes it so it never gets old! There are literally only four things you can do throughout the game: build roads, construct settlements, upgrade your settlements to cities, and buy ""development cards"" (like wild cards that help you.) You can learn how to play this game in 15 minutes, but it will never, ever get old.-Randomness: The island of Catan changes every time you play, with different placements of resources and ports between games, along with different probabilities that each resource will be rolled. One of the keys to each game is determining which resource(s) will be scarce and planning your builds accordingly.-Other-Player Interaction/Trades: You simply cannot win at Catan without trading with other players! It's so fun to see how much you can get for your rare resources, even though you're constantly worrying that the trades you make will help your opponents more than they help you. That's part of the fun!SUGGESTED ""HOUSE RULES""-Full Randomization: The game recommends an ""A-R"" order for the 18 numbers that determine which dice rolls are associated with each resource, but we prefer to assign numbers to resource tiles completely randomly. This makes for a more dynamic game, since you can have settlements that simultaneously touch two ""8"" hexagons, for example.-No Robber: Rather than playing with the robber (an attack feature that comes up whenever a ""7"" is rolled), we like to make sure that everyone meets the required 7-card limit and then re-roll the dice. Then, when someone plays a Knight Development Card, they get to pick a free resource from the bank.-Avoiding the 7+ Card Trap: When we have hands that we REALLY don't want to lose, we give the player whose turn it is whatever cards we need to get our hand back down to 7. It's like taking out an insurance policy on your hand, but you have to be careful because it can tip the scale and give your opponent a power turn!-Future Trades: When I really need to make a trade happen, I like to offer my opponents available resources in my hand while also promising them a resource that I'll get later. For example, ""If you give me a brick, I'll give you a sheep now and also my next wood.""I could go on and on with additional strategies and quirks of the game, but suffice it to say here that this is one of my very favorite board games and I look forward to playing it for years to come. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do. Happy Settling!",5.0
691,B00U26V4VQ,R2FRZJQM5ALFVG,"SO FUN (no, seriously). Plus the ONLY board game my teens will play.","  I came across Catan while desperately searching for a Christmas present that did not involve electronics. I have two teenagers, boys 14 & 16, and they are full blown into electronics, whether it's games on their iPhone, computer, Xbox, PS4 etc... It drives me insane and I really wanted to give them something that had nothing to do with electronics.After reading some good reviews about Catan, I decided to take the leap and buy it for Christmas last year. My kids opened it, rolled their eyes and it was set aside for months.One day I decided to pull it out and blow off the dust and force them to play, since I had spent more money on it than any other board game ever. To keep their impatience from volcanically erupting, in lieu of reading the directions, we watched a short 15 minute youTube video on how to play. That was more in tune with speaking their language, and was not only incredibly helpful, but sparked their attention.Incredulously, after our first game, they immediately wanted to play AGAIN. It was a true miracle. Not only that, the very next day, they woke up and ASKED first thing if they could play it again. I am absolutely serious. That's when I was determined to write an Amazon review to let other parents of teenagers obsessed with electronics know that there IS something else out there that can get their teens attention and be a blast for the whole family.My teens and I like it so much because it's similar to Monopoly but it takes a fraction of the time (about an hour). The game moves pretty quickly and keeps you engaged as you strategize, trade and plan. The basic gist is each person's goal is to create 'settlements' and build roads which bring you points, and whoever reaches 10 points wins the game. The settlements are similar to Monopoly's houses, with which you accrue with money, but in Catan, you obtain the settlement houses using resources (brick, sheep, hay, ore, wood). It may sound boring, but it's really not and it's super fun. So fun that we always bring it with us on road trips too.So if you're looking for something that is NOT an electronic mind-sucking zombie-making gift, consider Catan, spend the money and rebond with your kids over a good old-fashioned board game.",5.0
692,B00U26V4VQ,RMUIH8OM6U2QP,Like the Most Boring version of Monopoly on earth,"  So two of us have played this game twice now, each time at 2 1/2 hr in length. Once in a cabin in the woods.  We feel we have given it a good chance and find it INCREDIBLY BORING. We just don't get how this game could be the best selling game of all time around the world. It's tedious. It's slow. It's boring. It's a time waster and we found ourselves in a circular series of moves that at no point brought either of us any satisfaction. In fact, the ""winner"" was so happy to be done with the effing game and had no desire to brag or do a victory dance. It was more like, ""Finally! It's done."" Way too expensive of a game to produce this kind of response.Reminded us of an extremely boring game of Monopoly--but Monopoly is high octane and loads more fun compared to this!We are so perplexed by its draw that we are going to do some on line research and see how we are missing all the ""fun"" and ""addiction"" folks in other reviews went on about. Maybe because it was only two of us playing???Save yourself the $44 bucks. Just buy Monopoly. You'll have more fun.

It was very complicated to learn for me because I‚Äôm not into strategy games but my husband and son caught on quick. I think it helps if you are a competitive family that isn‚Äôt afraid to rob other family members and play aggressively. That really kept the our teenagers interested.

The first time my friend introduced me to the game, we played for 2 days non-stop. I missed school because of this game! Having so much fun with a simple game, I decided to pick up a copy for myself from the local store. I introduced my friends to it and it was an instant hit. (they all bought a copy for themselves as well). Unfortunately, my old 4th edition copy got lost and was never found. I decided to get this one to replace that lost one. Boy oh boy, I am happy.

695,B00U26V4VQ,R24RYFPIIN7Z6J,Maybe the best game of all time?,"  I have been playing Settlers of Catan for over 15 years and while many other games have come and gone, I still think this is my favorite game of all time.  This is a great strategy game that isn't hard to learn, but like an onion there are many levels to peal back.  While the game is pretty easy to learn, the strategy is what makes it so fun.  There is no one perfect strategy, which means every game can be different.  We change the rules sometimes and play to 12 which makes games go a little longer and requires you to use more strategy to win. I have probably played this games close to 500 times and I really never get sick of it. Being a strategy game, it is definitely not for everyone.  I have probably introduced 20-30 people to this game and only a handful didn't love it, which is understandable.  If you have never tried it then you should give it a go because it really is awesome.  I also love the updated board and pieces as my old Settlers version is pretty ratty and drab.  Great game and if you watch you can often get it on sale for around $20-25.",5.0

We don't use the robber at all- it caused too much contention.3, in order to make the games shorter (2 hours per game üò±), we only build roads leading to ports where we can trade.We kept all other rules.

697,B00U26V4VQ,R3K2AP3386XZM6,"cool game for learning what you hate about your friends, overpriced","  I feel like it needs something, and not one of those weird expansions. To win, you must be cunning, but not so much that everyone gangs up to make sure you don't win.DON'T even BOTHER reading the rules if you don't know how to play, because they're only written to provide clarifications upon the inevitable ensuing arguments about the rules. You will need a worthy and patient veteran to explain how to start a game. Because this is a game that involves both strategy - PARTICULARLY at the SETUP part before 'regular gameplay' starts - AND luck, you will either be extremely unlucky, or extremely lucky that you are not the extremely unlucky one in your first game.Yes, this is similar to Risk in the way that one is competing for finite resources on a shared field. But instead of dice rolls determining the outcome of battles, dice rolls determine your income of resources. And instead of choosing an ally or enemy to attack and conquer, you make trade requests to fulfill your construction which awards points. It's diplomatic in a different way. Veteran Catan players who are consistently paying attention could probably have a quick game under 40 minutes, but any game involving newbies will require a lot of explaining before the game can even begin, and then strategizing is another issue after that.",4.0

700,B07QQHTD4Q,R34CHUOIYPCGJF,Fun game if you like cooperative games and don't mind cheap components,"  This review might be a little long; but I hope it is helpful.  Yet, if you just want the bottom line, here it is: this is a fun, easy to learn and to fun play game for the whole family, provided that (a) you like ‚Äúcooperative games‚Äù and (b) you don‚Äôt mind lower quality components.  Now for more details:In this game, each player plays as a different character (with different special abilities) trying to help a village survive attacks from any number of several ‚Äúclassic‚Äù monsters while trying to complete certain tasks needed to defeat the monsters.  As in all cooperative games, the players play together against the game itself.  They can all win by meeting the winning conditions or lose in a number of different ways.  The game is similar to another cooperative game called Pandemic: Reign of Cthulhu, which is excellent but which did not get a lot of attention when it came out.  Reign of Cthulhu, however is a hard game and you are likely to lose more often than not.  In Horrified, it is much easier to control the difficulty level and it is not difficult to win when played against certain combinations of two monsters.  The game can be set to a higher difficulty level by adding monsters or by selecting the monsters that offer more of a challenge to defeat.  Horrified also does a slightly better job than Reign of Cthulhu in driving the theme of the game across.  There are a lot of thoughtful little details in Horrified that those of you who have watched the classic horror movies will recognize (from the names of the Villagers, to the items the players collect to defend against, and attack, the monsters, to illustrations in some of the cards, etc.)  Also, not everyone is familiar with the Cthulhu stories, but everyone (even younger kids) is familiar with Frankenstein‚Äôs monster, the Wolfman, the Mummy, Dracula and the other monsters in this game.  A game with four players should take about one and a half hours, which I think is perfect for a family game.  All in all, I have enjoyed the game and look forward to playing it again with different combinations of monsters.Unfortunately, the game is not perfect and the biggest negative for me is the low quality of the components.  The cards are really flimsy. You will want to sleeve them if you are going to play the game a lot, which adds a cost to the cost of the game.  But the most disappointing is the quality of the monsters‚Äô mini figures.  They are made of cheap molded plastic.  When I opened my copy of the game, I noticed the mummy had been in the box pinned under the weight of other components and was bent over looking like it was falling over.  Dracula is also bending forward a little bit (looking like he is hovering over someone with this cape).  I contacted  Ravensburger and they graciously agreed to send me a replacement.  But because they sent it in an envelope, the poor mummy was again crushed along the way and the replacement was in even worse condition than the original (see the photo).  It barely stands up.  I am not going to return the game because of a crappy figure, but being a big player in the board game market, Ravensburger should know better.  Lastly, with so many cardboard pieces and the fragile figures, the box really needs a good insert that would let you organize the components and keep the figures from getting crushed.  I now spend a lot of attention at how I place the figures back in the box because I am afraid they will bend while the game is not in use.  I own at least one other Ravensburger game, by the way, so I am not trying to pick at them.  On the contrary, I am saying they are a good company (and their customer service is great) which is why I am surprised at the low quality of the components in this game which I think will be a very popular game.I don't mind owning both Reign of Cthulhu and Horrified, but if you already own and love Cthulhu and play it often, this one might be redundant.  But if you are looking for a more accessible theme, particularly for younger players, and particularly around Halloween, you want to consider Horrified.The Good:‚Äì Great theme‚Äì Fun and easy to play, easy to learn‚Äì Good for adults and children alike‚Äì Just about the right length playing time‚Äì High replayability value because you can create different combinations of monsters to play against‚Äì Easy to control the difficulty level‚Äì Can be played soloThe Bad:‚Äì Fragile monster figures‚Äì No box insert‚Äì Low quality paper cards",4.0
701,B07QQHTD4Q,R372KYGR8MSYWP,A Total Blast!,"  I don't even know where to start...if you're a casual fan of the old Universal Monster movies like Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman Creature From the Black Lagoon and others, then you'll like this game. The monsters are on the loose in a village and you have to save the villagers by working together with the other players. Adults and kids will like it, and it does get just a little tense at times, but you can decide how hard or easy to make the game before you start.HOWEVER...if you are a super geek (like me) when it comes to these films you will LOVE THE HECK out of this game. There are so many nice little touches to evoke memories of the great catalog of Universal monster movies from the '30's, '40's  and '50's it would be hard to point out the best. Hmmm...nope, I can point out the best; as soon as you open the box you're greeted with...nah, I can tell you, but I won't. I don't want to ruin the nice little surprise.

That way we can play as a couple or with our game night pals.The best part of this turned based strategy game was that one player plays the dinosaurs, which really just want to eat the other characters.The other player (or players) play familiar characters from the movie that all have specific skills (like distracting the dinos by screaming and sneaking way, or rescuing your friends, etc). There are two ways to win. The people win if they can get a couple of their group off the island via the helicopter pad (some sacrifices must be made for the better good) or the dinosaurs win by... you guessed it... eating delicious intruders.The game board is random and the characters switch out, which meant that each play was unique so there is a high replay value.We had a blast :)",5.0

The learning curve is moderate. Helps if you've played other co-op games like Pandemic or the Forbidden series. Took about an hour to complete. Also has a solo game play option in the manual.We have the original Pandemic and the 3 Forbidden games. I'd put this one up there at the top of my list of co-op games.

It's kind of fun to choose a character that you don't mind getting eaten (Nedry!!), knowing you get to 'respawn' as a different character. Only gripe is that I found it at Target over the holiday weekend for half the price!!  Otherwise, fantastic strategy game.",5.0

710,B07QQHTD4Q,R3NVU1HLNSF3H5,Great Game with Flavor of Universal Horror,"  Played this for the first time today, and we LOVED it!  It was great fun, required considerable strategy, and had the flavor of an old horror movie, with the monsters chasing the characters and villagers all around the board.  We managed to eek out a win at the starter level, and will be playing this _many_ times in the future.  With so many monsters, there are plenty of variations and challenges to come.  Did I mention that the components are great, too?  They are!  A treat for any fan, this game is sure to be a favorite for all Monster Kids and gamers!  A _must own_ for lovers of Universal Horror!",5.0
711,B07QQHTD4Q,R16QPMGB3IJF1Z,Learning curve is worth the fun and excitement.,  Very fun family game with a bit of a learning curve but was a ton of fun once we got the hang of it. My family was totally into it and we will be playing it a lot in the future.,5.0
712,B07QQHTD4Q,R1W35T9FFOQFPL,This JAWS co-op game takes a bites out of other games!,"  I really just became Ravenburger's favorite board gamer. My family plays A LOT of board games. We just love them. We can hardly decide on a movie or tv show that everyone agrees on, but board games are our great neutralizer. We have enjoyed co-op games in the past with such favorites as Pandemic and Forbidden Island, but none have the nostalgic feel and visualization as being in a Ravensburger game.JAWS is an excellent game. It mixes strategy with the luck of the dice. The gameboard graphics take you to Amity Island and Quint's Orca ship. The playing pieces- cards, tokens, beachgoers, and wooden ships-shark-and players are top-notch. The premise of the game is fun and fair to both the shark and the characters. The game may be a bit difficult for newcomers to co-op games but I must say that these directions are excellently written and are presented in a nice and thorough and clear sequence.Note: Ravensburger games do not come sealed in cellophane. Rather, they are taped closed.Suggestions for Ravensburger: Make the board a little bigger as such beautiful graphics on this gameboard should be displayed in a bigger format. Also, beachgoers should have a little beach container to be sunning in waiting for their turn in the ocean to possibly encounter The Shark.Note to Ravensburger: I volunteer to be a future game tester for you. I truly love your games!!!!",5.0

714,B07QQHTD4Q,RNOMW3UGSPQ0S,My New Favorite,"  Work together as a team to defeat classic horror monsters. Horrified features classic Universal monsters such as Frankenstein's monster, his bride, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, Dracula, etc. You choose your villain, and the number of monsters you'd like to defeat. Each monster has it's own unique features, challenges and attack rating. During game play, you must collect items to complete tasks and defeat monsters. Guide villagers to safety, and complete puzzles. Each Hero (player) has their own unique special actions/advantages.It's more complicated to learn than the average board game, but don't be intimidated. It's well worth learning. It's meaty, it's strategic, and it's a guaranteed hit. It's also a refreshing change of pace to be working with your fellow players, rather than competing with them.",5.0
715,B07QQHTD4Q,R3E10MZCACYGJT,Spooky classic fun,"  Weither you game often or not at all this is one for the collection. Not only does it look bad ass on the shelf, it's fun and easy to learn too!We are casual gamers here, I got this because it's one of the few two player games out there that looks somewhat dynamic. The game play is about an hour with two people. It offers a single player mode I've yet to try but I like that it is playable solo!The general concept of the game is you choose your character (a hero) then choose two or more iconic monsters depending on your difficulty, to take on as you save your village and villagers before they completely terrorize (there's a terror ""counter"" similar to the haunt counter in betrayal) or kill the heros! Each monster has a game card that has a specific task you must complete before the monster becomes vulnerable to attack which I thought was a fun spin. You get 4 actions in any order you choose each turn (pick up, trade, move, attack, special card or action) and after each players turn it's always the monsters turn! You gotta be careful because the villagers will spawn at random depending on the card drawn to which you have to return them safely to their rightful location before the monsters get them! If a monster gets them, the terror counter goes up and they die, if the monster get you, the terror counter goes up but you're sent to the hospital on the board. If that terror counter reaches it's max, you loose. If the monsters action card draw deck gets depleted, you loose. You win if you defeat the monsters before that happens!Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is because the mini figs of the monsters are cheaply made, most came bent and kind of warped but all other pieces are quality and will last many game nights. I just wish the mini figs were better quality as they're a really cool features to the game.",4.0
716,B07QQHTD4Q,R33AAG2HAN23J2,Grade A Game Design!,"  I was very pleased with this game. I've been an avid tabletop and board gamer for 30 of my 40 years, and I love strategy, tactics, and roleplaying. My wife enjoys playing games, but is definitely what you would call a casual gamer. So, often the games I love are too complicated for her tastes. We've played two games of 'Horrified,' one on the novice setting (two monsters) and one on the standard setting (three monsters). During both games we had a blast!Presentation/ Subject Matter: 5/5. The game looks fantastic. The artwork is beautiful and the layout of everything is easy and intuitive, and c'mon, who doesn't love the Universal Monsters?Quality: 5/5. The colors are vibrant and all the components feel durable. Nothing looks or feels cheap. The minis are nicely detailed and the cardstock is heavy weight and substantial.Rules: 5/5. Very clearly written and laid out, with quick reference cards. The game seems well play tested and nicely balanced. A challenge, but not frustrating.Replay value: 5/5. With many different monster combinations, this game has lasting potential, and isn't repetitive.Strategy level: 3/5. While the strategy and tactics aren't going to blow away seasoned gamers, it's complicated enough to hold their interest, while being easy enough to understand easily for casual gamers.Overall: 4.8/5. A very pleasant gaming experience. Highly recommend! Kudos to the designers for a job well done!",5.0
717,B07QQHTD4Q,RZQEK1Z54M4YP,Fantastic family game (for all ages)!,"  I have played a lot of games. My recommendations for an introductory family game used to be Castle Panic or Forbidden Island. Both are still very good, but Horrified is even better. It works for people who have never played a modern board game before, as well as those like me who have played hundreds of titles.All of the games I mentioned are ""cooperative"" games, where everyone either wins together, or loses together. I love that concept, and it's a great way for a family to bond rather than competing. Horrified puts you in a town that is being terrorized by classic Universal monsters, and you have to save villagers and defeat the monsters.One thing that sets Horrified apart is that each monster is unique. To defeat Dracula, you have to use red items to smash 4 coffins in the corners of the board, and then go to where Dracula is and use yellow items to kill him. To defeat the Creature from the Black Lagoon, you play items to advance a boat in a mini-game that resembles Candy Land. Once the boat is at the end, you can move to where the creature is, and defeat it by discarding one item of each color. Each of the other monsters is distinct like that, with their own mini-game. Since you typically face 2-3 of the monsters each time you play, and you choose from multiple heroes with special abilities, each session feels very different.I have played Horrified with about 10 people, of varying levels of gaming experience, and everyone has enjoyed it. It's easy to learn, and takes under an hour to play. It works great with anywhere from 2 to 5 players.",5.0
718,B07QQHTD4Q,R2IU8ZVF7L7VXI,There is a Learning Curve,"  There is a learning curve with this game (seriously... it comes with a web address that you go to for game tutorial), and I watched a few YouTube videos to figure out how to play it.  After we punched out the billion game pieces, and we were several pages in on the instruction booklet on How to Set Up the Game for Game Play, my kids lost interest and abandoned me at the table.  We invested at least 90 minutes, and we have not played the game once.  Every now and then, I ask ""Want to try Horrified again?"" and there is just a chorus of ""Noooooo"".  I gave it two stars because I think the game is really well made. Also I don't think it is Ravensburger's fault my kids didn't want to invest any time learning a new game.  They want something that you learn in a few minutes and can play right away with little set-up.  If that is the kind of game you are looking for, I highly recommend Ravensburger's Labyrinth!  That is our favorite by far!",2.0
719,B07QQHTD4Q,R1NHQTDJT7AWLH,Fun!,"  We love this game! It's way more challenging than I thought. It's really hard for the humans to win. We haven't accomplished it yet. I thought it was going to be a baby/kids game, but it's more for adults and older kids. It's a cooperative game like Pandemic. I would say it's my favorite cooperative game so far. I looked on YouTube for an easy howto. Only took a few minutes to learn, however there are some complex rules. Make sure you know them all.The pieces and cards seem to be good quality. The people and dinosaurs are made of wood.",5.0
720,B07QQHTD4Q,ROPDPCC8NKST,Welcome to Jurassic Park: DANGER!,"  This is a nice family weight, 1 vs many game with excellent theming, easy gameplay, and simple, but solid components.  One player plays all the dinosaurs trying to eliminate 3 characters (there is no player elimination).  The other player(s) play one or more characters (pick from 10 roles) trying to escape the island.  Dr. Alan Grant, or Ellie Sattler, or Ian Malcolm, or even the kids, Tim and Lex.  Each has their own goal and special deck of action cards.  As the dinosaurs attack, the characters lose cards, until they have none to play, at which point they are eliminated.  The player plays a new character.  Depending on team size, the human players need to get 2 or more characters with their goals to the helicopter.  The humans must first successfully turn on the systems in three locations -- the visitor center (return 2 cards to your hand), the maintenance station (turn on the electric fences), and the control center (lockdown all three locations to keep out dinosaurs).  When all three have been activated, the helicopter is called and available for the human players' win condition.  This game uses really nice art from the movie, has easy to read cards that look great and cool dinosaur meeples that move around the island.  For ~$20, this game is a great value and loads of fun playing either side.",5.0
721,B07QQHTD4Q,R2M3Z0OIG4CWHV,Old-Fashioned Fun!,"  Horrified is reminiscent of traditional board games in that it involves the movement of tokens along pathways.  What makes it significantly different is that most of the action is driven by strategy instead of the randomness of dice rolls.  Players decide how the monster-fighting heroes will proceed, and, after each hero's offensive action, a card is drawn that details the possible counter-offensive of the monster(s).  Cards also indicate when and where villagers and weapons will appear.  The level of difficulty can easily be controlled by the number and type of monsters added to the game.  Oddly, the rules state that a solitary player should use only one hero when there is actually no difficulty involved in a sole person conducting the game with multiple hero tokens.A 15-page, 7 1/2"" X 10"" instruction booklet is included, which first advises one to watch a video to learn how to play.  (The indicated web address  brings one to the company's retail site, which has no indication of such a video.)  Luckily, the hard-copy helps are uncomplicated and easy to comprehend.  One contradictory-sounding statement does appear under ""Items"":  ""Only one Item of the color shown may be played per action"".  Then, ""Any number of Items of the color shown may be played in a single action."" (?)  [The latter is what actually happens in game play.]As usual, there are several non-company online videos available to explain and provide playthroughs of the game.  It just seems that a standard board game should come with a basic walkthrough written in the instruction booklet and not rely on the internet as a significant supplement.All in all, the game offers fun, straightforward play that does not lend itself to conundrums of procedural rules and questions concerning the allowance of various maneuvers.  Players have a limited number of chances to either dispatch or neutralize the menacing monsters, so the length of the game cannot be protracted.  Easy-to-follow instructions are printed on every card used in play, making it unnecessary to remember a plethora of rules.  It's simple enough for children and challenging enough for adults.  Highly recommended!",5.0
722,B07QQHTD4Q,RIKKMPN69E7F3,Fun and atmospheric family/gateway game.,"  I'm not a fan of ""coop"" type games.  Most are designed in such a way that an ""alpha"" gamer type will usually surface and bend everyone else to their will.  That doesn't happen so much with Horrified.  Somehow, they've managed to design a game that discourages that style of play while being fun.  It's currently the only coop game I'll willingly play.  As a bonus it has a solo mode that's excellent.The theme is very well done and integrated into the game play - a rarity in this age of pasted on themes.  The graphics and game play evoke the feel of the old Universal horror movies with tension from chasing, or being chased by, the monsters.  It's very easy to learn as well as teach making it a very good choice for group gatherings or times when you want to play a game but most of the people present are just not ""heavy"" gamer types.  With a maximum of 5 players it's not a true ""party game"" but works quite well in such settings.I've played a half dozen games solo and 4 more with 1 or 2 other players.  Games were done with the recommended ""easy"" variant (2 monsters) for the first game or two but quickly moved to ""standard"" (3 monsters) as we quickly figured out 2 monsters is a cake-walk.  Fighting 3 monsters is better but we've not yet lost a game and none have been in danger of being lost.  With that in mind, we feel 3 monsters is great for novice players as long as they have a more experienced gamer as a guide.  Our next game will be with 4 monsters.  The solo game feels just a bit more difficult than with more players but not significantly so.Due to the recommended random monster and hero pulls you can get lots of variety in the games.  We've yet to find a hero combo that's just not that good, even with the ""lesser"" ones.  Some of the heroes almost feel overpowered (especially one who can ""bounce"" around the board at will as a special power).The biggest con I have is the quality of the miniatures.  While they *look* good they're rather cheaply made.  Something along the line of a cheaper plastic army guy.  Several of ours came bent.  While this can easily be fixed it's the cheap, thin, plastic that's the ultimate cause.  The player pieces and ""villagers"" are standees (and really should have been plastic as well).  I'm not a fan of standees.  However, these are thicker cardboard and fit tightly into their stands.  As long as you put them in their base and leave them alone I don't foresee any issues.The box really needs a better insert to properly hold the various components.  It's OK but just OK.  You'll want to bag some things and sleeve the cards.  At least the card storage part of the box is large enough to accommodate sleeved cards.Player/hero boards, items, and standees are thicker cardboard and there's a nice velour type drawstring bag for the items (they're put on the board via blind draw).  The monster ""boards"" are the thickness of a standard playing card.  It'd have been nice if these, too, were cardboard.  The cards for the game are fairly standard playing card style - no linen finish (and you'll want to sleeve them for easier shuffling).The solo mode is very fun and requires only slight changes for play.  Essentially there's a hero you don't use and 2 ""perk"" cards you either remove or just draw again should they surface during play.  No ""automa"" player/setup/guide needed.  It plays identically to multi-player games.4 stars as experienced/eurogamer types may find it a bit simplistic and too easy at the ""standard"" level and several of the components could be better.Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun family or gateway game.",4.0
723,B07QQHTD4Q,R1B0R921Z5SI0G,My favorite co-op game so far...,"  We love this game!  It is different every time you play and it ranges in difficulty.  The game is beautiful and very detailed.  We played with a large range of ages, 8-40-years old.  The adults seemed to enjoy it more because we took the strategy-part very seriously -- nobody made a move without first confirming with the group.  We lost a lot of times, and kept trying over a long-weekend until we finally beat 4 monsters at once (highest difficulty).  My youngest enjoyed being in charge of setting up and putting everything away (there are a lot of pieces).  The set up takes time, and there is a booklet you have to read before you can play.  Plus, the set up is different each time depending on what monsters you decide to fight.  That might annoy people who like to just open a box and quickly start playing.  The kids enjoyed the game for awhile and then started to get a little bored.  This was partly due to the adults wanting to discuss multiple strategies between each turn.  The teenagers in our group started playing on their phones while waiting for their turn, which doesn't work because it is a co-op game, so you have to pay attention and work together during each turn.  I liked that feature the most because even when it isn't your turn you still get to help the other player(s).  The best part about this game or any co-op game is that you all work together.  You win together or you lose together.  This is great in a family setting, especially if there is a wide disparity in ages.  It puts all of us on a level playing field.  I highly recommend this game!",5.0
724,B07QQHTD4Q,R86ZXMAISTAJV,I love this game,"  I'm a board game nerd.  I'm also a horror nerd.  This game is like a match made in heaven.  It combines the lore and aesthetic of the Universal Monsters with a fun cooperative board game that's simultaneously quick and easy to learn and yet adaptable enough to have high re-play ability.The mechanics are pretty simple and well-designed.  It's somewhat reminiscent of Pandemic in terms of both its cooperative nature and in terms of its mechanics.  One of the lovely things about it is that it can be set up in about five minutes, the rules can be learned in another five, and yet there are numerous combinations of monsters--each of which has its own unique abilities and tasks--that make the game different enough on replay to be fun every time.The components are primarily cardboard (though the monsters are plastic tokens), but you can tell great care was paid in assembling everything from the unique mechanics for each monster right down to the artwork on the cardboard pieces.  Fans of the Universal Monsters will feel right at home while playing this game.Admittedly, it will probably only really appeal to fans of the old Universal horror movies.  The game itself, while certainly a good game, doesn't offer any massive innovations.  But if you are a fan of monster movies, whether you're a board game player or not, you really need to get a copy of Horrified.",5.0
725,B07QQHTD4Q,R1A3QJHQMIOBNT,Spooky Pandemic,"  If you have never played pandemic then Horrified sets up similar to that game where you're gathering resources to bring to a central point to accomplish a goal. The goal in this game being to defeat the Universal Studio Monsters.What works here is the theme, I love anything horror related, and the monsters are in the spooky range that the theme wouldn't frighten young children. Fans of the old films will even recognize an appearance from Abbot and Costello as Wilbur and Chick from Abbot and Costello meet Frankenstein.Setup takes seconds, as does explaining the game, and as simple as it may seem I have seen seasoned tabletop gamers get surprised how quickly things can turn pear shaped.Absolute fun, I would suggest this be in everyones collection.",5.0
726,B07QQHTD4Q,R253R08RIPLMEX,"Unique, cool game","  This is a truly unique experience.  I am a huge fan of Jaws, and when I found out there was a Jaws game that had multiple phases of game play - where you start out trying to protect people on the beach, and then a second stage where you work to defeat Jaws, I had to get it.I really like the unique game play.  I personally think I like it most as a 2 player game, but it seems meant for 4, as a 3 v 1 game in 4 player mode which is different than most games I play.The components are nice, but not great (although I enjoy the meeples immensely), but I wish the game board was nicer - it is just thin and cheap, and a nicer game board would have done wonders since there really isn't all that much to this game (the board is small, so a nice, thick game board would have been amazing).The only downside for me is that it's game play is limited by the multiple players vs one.  I am not a big fan of that, but if that is fine by you then you will enjoy this game (I would not really ever want to play with 3 people even if they say you can).This game has good replay-ability and won't feel the same every game, even though it will always be similar, so you can break it out every once in a while and it will still feel fresh and fun.  It really does feel like you are a part of the movie.",4.0
727,B07QQHTD4Q,R24QU0HS5CA0SW,This is a bit overcomplicated,"  As much as I love Jurassic Park, this game is overcomplicated, it just kind of sucks the fun out of it. The artwork is extremely cool, and I'll probably end up framing some pieces for wall hanging, but it's not really a fun game.",3.0

We've had it for about a month and a half and have probably played 10+ times. There is definitely a learning curve -- I recommend watching the Watch It Played video about this game like two times before starting -- but once you get it, it is actually pretty easy to understand. The variety of monster combos always gives you a different experience, and I love the fact that it is cooperative, which feels rare with board games. Game play is about an hour, give or take. Granted, we are both in our 20s, so I am not sure how a younger kid would fare with this (both for complexity and length of gameplay), but if you're up for it, it is a great time, every time.A fun bonus is that, if you want to, you can paint the minifigures. Just get a nice set of microbrushes and some acrylics of your choice and go to town. It was a nice date activity, and adds to the ambiance of the game!",5.0

730,B088QSDB7S,RFEH6QS6S12XV,Got it right! Perfect lead into Gloomhaven universe.,"  Jaws of the Lion is a fantastic evolution of Gloomhaven's setup. Gloomhaven is a great game and deserves its ranking, but its hard to teach (and play) and the setup takes a while to get going.  Jaws of the Lion shortcuts a lot of the setup and the starter senarios, the added text on cards, and the tips catapult this game up my personal play rankings.  If you were on the fence about spending the money on Gloomhaven this is the game to play first.  The rules and game play mechanics are unchanged and the game is far more ""coached"". This makes it easy to get the core gameplay down and that carries over very well to the original.",5.0

However, I feel this is more beneficial (or in line with a product review) than those about the package being lost, damaged, or out of return policy since that doesn't properly represent the product.ACTUAL PRODUCT PACKAGING REVIEW:I just received the game (about 30 minutes ago) and, although I'll probably love the game, I'm a little disappointed with the packaging. At initial glance, I thought the box was damaged because it was bulging (i.e. one side about a 1/2 inch higher than the other when sealed). Upon opening the box, I saw that it was due to the box being poorly designed. It barely holds the game after all the items are punched out and stored ""properly"" in the box. I quoted ""properly"" because I still can't figure out how to get everything to fit inside without the box bulging a little. As it stands and if using the original insert, it's an extremely tight squeeze to the point I keep checking to make sure nothing is being bent. I wish the product/box designer would have given .25 to .50 inch more room for to allow a few more imperfect ways to repackage the game. That said (and even though I hate doing this), I may just remove the insert(s) to allow more ways to configure the game for repackaging purposes.",2.0

735,B088QSDB7S,R2GAW6LPIZ772O,Gloomhaven Junior,"  If you already finished Gloomhaven, Jaws of the Lion might not be enough for you to play since it‚Äôs too short and too easier. Frosthaven is possible to be the right one. However, Gloomhaven is too heavy for me and both less than 10 years old kids, we never want to read the whole thing to start playing, so it sits there from 2018 to now. Jaws of the Lion provides a quick method for us to learning how to play Gloomhaven from fist 5 scenario, so we could catch up Gloomhaven easier later. The best thing is for the setting via book style map, so we don‚Äôt need to waste time for setting up. In addition, the storage is improved comparing with Gloomhaven to provide a the token tray.

743,B088QSDB7S,R338MSW9FR0ZMC,Roleplaying lite in tabletop format with an ever-expanding depth,"  Cepholofair games has produced a great standalone game that serves as an entry point to their more complex products.  The box is heavy and stuffed with content, and will keep gamers occupied for days.  Solo mode is no more complicated than having a single player control more than one character, and the experience is still enormous fun.The name ""Jaws of the Lion"" belongs to a group of mercenaries (the characters the players will control) in the settlement of Gloomhaven.  The game is structured on a continuing campaign played in individual scenarios with the feel of one of the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" books.  Actions and decisions made by the players result in the opening of new quest lines and occasionally the closing of others.  After all, if you have the option of helping a shop owner or stealing from her and your first impulse is to steal, your future options will not include helping her as she no longer trusts you.  It should be stressed that this game is cooperative, and each player has a vested interest in teaming up with and enhancing the abilities of the characters of other players as well as their own.  One Leroy Jenkins can have a disastrous effect for the whole group.The mechanics of the game are introduced slowly using a few different booklets, allowing players to get basics cemented before introducing new concepts.  As the story advances and characters increase in power, new abilities are unlocked and new game features made available.  The scenarios are designed to highlight these new abilities and functions, letting players get more comfortable with the foundation of the game and understanding how the characters are intended to perform, making for more creative thinking and dynamic play.Dice are not a part of this game, instead assuming that an attack will have an effect but modified by numeric values or combat effects (eg: stunning, poison) that are determined by modifier decks associated with each character; monsters have their own deck.  Players eventually gain access to items that will increase their abilities and ways to increase their characters' lethality and effectiveness.  Many monsters have innate abilities that produce negative effects on characters, and there is a variance in how tough those opponents become based on the number of players and the power of the characters.  Each scenario is challenging, and may require more than a single effort to pass.Monsters are actually controlled by the players based on rules about the order in which they become active, what player character is targeted by attacks, and how the monsters will move.  This information is usable by the players and can become key strategic factors when moving, attacking, etc.  A weaker character may try to move later in the round than a monster that deals a great bit of damage so that a more robust character can soak up the attacks.  The character moves after those monsters attacks so she is safe, then attacks at the end of the round; on the next round, the character moves as early as possible to get out of the way before the powerful monster gets a chance to attack her back.The scenario booklet is well structured and contains the maps on which the game is played.  The rules being in a separate booklet means that the scenario describes details specific to the current adventure of the characters but there is no need to disturb the figures and terrain features to look up effects or resolve rules-based questions.  A well-designed breakup of function that makes learning the game and playing through the scenarios easier than a disruptive method that bundles everything into a single booklet.It is rare that I have encountered simplified versions of games that are effective at easing a person into a more complicated ruleset; the best example I can think of is the early '80s when Dungeons & Dragons was a streamlined entry point from which players would then graduate to the more detailed Advanced Dungeons & Dragons.  Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion has successfully become the most effective game I have seen for whetting the apetites of people who want to learn Gloomhaven but have been intimidated by the size and complexity of that system.The items and basic mechanisms of this game are reprints of components from the more complicated Gloomhaven game, and the characters - once developed to use standard cards roughly around level 5 - seem portable and compatible with the big brother game.  I am also tempted to go back and try a modified version of Jaws of the Lion using classes from the standard Gloomhaven game starting from level 1.If you or your group are into fantasy / roleplaying games but the cost of multiple rule books is daunting, or adventures are too easy or hard because encounters are not well scaled to your level, or play has become too formulaic, this is an easily affordable game with high replay value and excellent foundational systems for combat and character development.Buy this game, and add Gloomhaven to your wishlist.",4.0

I have used the older style for years and was hoping to see some improvements in this new release. The legs now attach to a solid square base, which is a nice upgrade from the previous model. However the tabs that help hold the ice in place still feel somewhat weak (as I'm sure they need to be a bit to allow the necessary give to squeeze the cubes in), but I'm hopeful they won't break as easily. The penguin substitute for the bear is nice, as something felt odd about knocking a polar bear into the ""water."" He feels sturdy and is really easy to put into the larger ice block. The hammer redesigns feel much better. The box fits everything just right when you first open it, but storing the game in this box is a bit of a hassle as it has to sit just right to close. I have taken to just storing the main square outside the box as it is hard to fit it all inside. Hoping this new release holds up better than the older version!",4.0

767,B01MS6B7BV,R2NZ2BF27WRY3C,"A lot of fun, but the materials are problematic.","  We bought this for our three year old daughter who loves boardgames. I had remembered living this game when I was a kid in the early 90s, and knew it would be a great family activity. While the game itself is the same, the materials have been changed in the last 30 years and not always for the best. I find it's difficult to keep the detachable legs on when turning the board over to replace the ""ice cubes"", which to a 3 year old is frustrating. The material for the cubes themselves is very different than I remember, and instead of them easily being knocked out one at a time, they tend to pull the adjacent cubes along. The mallets likewise seem to be a softer plastic that bends easily. Nothing has broken yet, but we do have a few ""crooked"" mallets.Even with those issues, we still have a blast playing this game together. It's a quick game, so it's easy to play multiple rounds before young minds want to move on to other things.",4.0

The objective is to work together to ruin the Sanderson Sisters‚Äô potion 3 times so the sun comes up on the witches board. You take turns changing the potion in the cauldron until you can stun a witch. However their magic prevents you from sharing your hand so you have to ask each other questions instead.Questions like:‚ÄúDo you have any _________ color cards?‚Äù - Asking only if the have a certain color.‚ÄúDo you have any Oil of Boil?‚Äù -Asking only if they have a certain ingredient.So one person asks a question & everyone answers yes or no. Then the person that asked the question lays down one card from their hand & picks up a new ingredient card. You take turns doing that until you can stun one of the witches. Once you get a certain set it will stun a particular witch & the sun is closer to rising. If you run out of ingredient cards before the sun rises (playing 3 rounds) then the Sanderson Sisters have won. There is other things that adds/changes up the game a bit like spell cards, Binx mover, & trick tokens. I added pictures of the instructions because they are long & detailed.

It is fun to play and easy to learn, it says for ages 8 and up, my 9 year old had no trouble grasping it and my 6 year old got it with minor assistance.  It also took us about 20 minutes to play which is nice.  The working together part I find good for kids as well since everyone is working together to beat the witches.

The game play was the most frustrating part by far though, it seemed like they tried to throw too many ideas into a game but it was also too simple at the same time.

Overall, very fun and visually appealing.The only con, and a minor one at that, is the box doesn't have a closing mechanism, so the materials can easily fall out if it is not face down on a table.

820,B08F65MX4L,R36GY6X9J9ZRVF,Strictly worse than the original edition,"  The original is probably the perfect board game.  It's fairly easy to easy, has great iconography, plays fairly quickly, is enjoyable at a range of skill levels and yet can still be a great game after many plays.  The balance of the original game, between different wonders and resource availability, was outstanding.  Unfortunately, this new edition changes some of the wonders for no good reason, and simply makes the game worse.  I'm not sure why they changed an all time masterpiece.  Anyway, don't buy this, but the original, and hopefully they'll just stop making this one.  This is the ""New Coke"" of boadgames.",3.0

The one I received has a board that is almost 12x12...actual playing area is 11x11.  The board is grey and comes with zip bags to separate the colors into.  If the zip bags and slightly bigger board are the only difference I don't see what makes it deluxe.  Wish I had gone with the cheaper one.  I guess I paid $10 extra for cheap zip bags.  I ordered the one that says Deluxe Blockus Game sold by Amazon and fulfilled by Amazon.  If I was giving stars only on the game itself it would have been 5...we love this game.

Reviews for this product and the 10""x10"" product seem to overlap/be mixed up.  I wanted to make sure I bought the larger size format.  For anyone else in the same boat, I had success by verifying the size of the item in the description section.  The box size neatly correlates to the game board size.  If the box is listed as 10""x10"", a 13""x13"" game board does not lie within!As other reviewers have noted, this is an excellent game.  It was new to me and my 6-yr-old and we both learned it quickly. There are layers and layers of strategy, and it teaches so many skills related to visual/spatial acuity, math, and strategy, all within a really enjoyable game. I definitely recommend it. It's engaging for kids and parents alike in this household.",5.0
824,B001P06GX4,R39OMB0R5GOV7K,Fun game but warped game tile,"  Bought this as a gift for my neighbor. We played it together and found one of the blue pieces is warped and does not sit flush against the board. We tried to gently bend it but ended up snapping it in the process. We super glued it for her as a temporary fix.I don‚Äôt really want to ask for the gift back in order to exchange it so I am trying to figure out how to replace just the broken piece. I could order the $4.00 bag of blue replacement tiles from the manufacturer‚Äôs website but 1) I shouldn‚Äôt have to pay more just it came this way and 2) I don‚Äôt know if the blokus ‚Äúdeluxe‚Äù pieces are the same size as the standard.What a pain.Update: I ended up buying a second game so I could swap out the tile with my neighbor and then  I just kept the game with the broken tile. I‚Äôm glad that I did not order the $4 piece bag from the manufacturer. I visited another family over Thanksgiving and saw they had the original, non-deluxe version that is available in store. Holy smokes, that board is tiny! The pieces are tiny! I wish I could have done a by side photo, the replacement tiles would not have fit at all.So, in the end we kept the game with the defective piece. We think of our friends every time we see it even though they moved away. Having now seen the original version, I would NEVER buy it or recommend that anyone else buy it. It is microscopic in comparison and would only be good if you are an ant. Buy this deluxe model, check all the tiles, and you‚Äôll be good to go.",4.0

We were able to open, read the instructions and start playing quickly (I can't stand when you have to consult the directions a ton of times because people are confused). It starts out simple enough but towards the end, we all realized how much more strategy we should have used from the beginning! The second match was much more interesting once we ""got"" it.My son even played it the next day by himself, trying to place as many of the pieces as he could on the board.",5.0
827,B001P06GX4,R3K0H6E7775TJD,Where has this game been all my life?!,"  I have watched bloggers and instagram influencers rave about this game.  I didn't really think we would love it that much, and wasn't excited about dropping $25.00 on a game, but then Covid happened and we needed some new games.  So I took the plunge.  With that being said, it's a REAL HIT!!  It gets used at least 5 days a week currently and we can play for up to two hours in a sitting.  The games are pretty quick, so in that two hour time span, we can average 4-7 games.  Our son is 15 and our daughter is 9, both of them highly enjoy this game, as well as my husband and I.  The rules and instructions were super simple and basic.  By our second time playing we felt like pros.  I'm not sure where this game has been all of my life!  Super fun, and really gets your brain thinking constantly to you next moves.I do think that $25.00 is a bit much price wise.  $15.00-20.00 seems more realistic, but considering how much playing time it is getting, I'll chalk it up as a win.The plastic pieces are great quality.  I do worry that the grey playing board will eventually crack, so we are just being careful with it.  Also the box seems a little on the flimsy side.  Minor yes, but once a game box is ruined that's bothersome to me.  So we will treat this with extra care.Aside from me thinking the price is a little high, and the flimsy box, I would not hesitate to gift this game to our family friend to enjoy as well!",5.0
828,B001P06GX4,RUF1FTMAB10D6,An adequate version of this game.,"  The board in this set measures 11 3/4 inches square, not the promised 13 inches square.  The board does have the full 400 squares.  The pieces are less substantial and a bit smaller than in the original version, although I wouldn't call them fragile.  There are 21 pieces of each color, as their should be.  So this may not be the version, physically, you are thinking about if you have played this game somewhere else.  However, this is still the same fun game to enjoy with friends or family.

836,B001P06GX4,R1BN8E5IJNJYFG,... Deluxe Blokus Game for my family and we absolutely love it. This game can be played by everyone,"  I bought Deluxe Blokus Game for my family and we absolutely love it.  This game can be played by everyone.The game is played on a square board divided into 20 rows and 20 columns, for a total of 400 squares. There are a total of 84 game tiles, organized into 21 shapes in each of four colors: blue, yellow, red and green.  The game tiles have 1 to 5 made up of different shapes.  The idea of the game is to strategically place these odd shaped tiles on the board and try to get rid of as many pieces as you possibly can.  In order to put down a tile it needs to touch the corner of the same colored tile that you are playing.  You can play this game with 2 to 4 people.  Each person getting the same amount of tiles and each person is represented by a color.  Once you cannot play any more of your tiles you are out of the game.  The individual with the least amount of tiles in their hands wins.  It is a game that can be played on many different levels even up to the highest of strategies.

842,B001P06GX4,R1HSKZLPS0NZRS,Blokus helps kids be smart,"  I am an instructor for the Summer Institute for the Gifted and at SIG I teach game strategy to 5-6 year old gifted children.  One of the games I use in this course is Blokus.  I highly recommend Blokus to any parent who wants to help their 5-7 year old have fun learning to be smart.The beauty of Blokus is that the rules are incredibly simple so a young child can learn them quickly, in under two minutes, and yet the strategy and thinking levels needed to get increasingly better at this game are quite complex.  This combination is exactly what makes a great game to teach critical thinking skills to young children.  Specifically, Blokus helps children develop spacial reasoning abilities, problem solving and perseverance.  It also can begin to develop thinking ahead skills.  But, this game is as hard as your child is ready for in that a child can play it and have fun before these capabilities are fully developed and have a blast while improving these skills and as their skills increase they can engage the game at higher degrees of complex thought.  With repeated play, you will see your child's thinking skills improve.My oldest daughter just turned five and we gave this to her for her birthday yesterday.  We have already played four times.  She loves it and we love seeing her work through the spatial constraints and opportunities the board gives you each turn.  You will hit a homerun if you give Blokus to your child as a gift both as a fun parent and a parent who helps to raise a smart child.",5.0

I wanted to have games that had quick rounds (~20-30 minutes) so that everyone could play and rules that were easy to learn and explain.  It's a great little game to have on your shelf as it's easy to jump in and play and easy for players of all ages to enjoy.While the concepts seem simple at first blush, the great thing about Blokus is that there's really no one right way or one right strategy to winning the game and everyone has a chance to win a round because of the dynamic nature of the game.My wife and I bust it out and play two-player rounds by the fire once in a while as well.If you like this type of game, I'd also recommend Rumis which is very similar to this game by plays in 3-dimensions instead of 2.

I wondered how anything this seemingly simple could be fun and hold the interest of kids who are conditioned to instant excitment from video games and adults whose choice of toys are electronic devices of some sort.  Let me first say that this is not one of those games where everyone will be chomping at the bit to open up and play after unwrapping it at Christmas time.  The game is basically a gray plastic box with a grid and various plastic shapes grouped into 4 different colors, similiar to Tetris pieces that you place on the grid.  Nothing fancy to look at and kids will probably push this present aside until all the other ""flashy"" toys are opened and played with.  But once they do, everyone will enjoy this very engaging, thought provoking, challenging, and addicting game and will want to play it time and time again.  It's rare to find such an intellectual game where all ages can compete.  The box says 5 to adult but to really appreciate the strategic content of the game, I would say that 8 to adult is more accurate.  It can be played as one game which takes about 15-20 min where the idea is to get rid of all or most of your pieces.  The ones left over are tallied with the player with the fewest points being the winner. Or you can play a set of games where points are tallied from each game and a winner is decided.  You place your shapes on the grid one at a time where they must touch another one of your pieces diagonally.  Play is then based on alternate pieces placed by each player..max 4 players.  Super fun, as challenging as the opponents are capable of, and a great framily game.",5.0
849,B001P06GX4,RR6AOS321IM0B,I LOVE this game!!,"  I absolutely love this game! My oldest son is 7 1/2 and I am so glad that the days of candy land and cootie are gone and the days of blockus are here!!!!! This game is so much fun to play.  I wasn't sure I would like it, but it had so many good reviews I decided to give it a try.  I was not disapointed.  The whole family likes it, but grandma, mom, and 7 yr old are completely hooked.  The strategy is addictive. I see the puzzle shapes in my sleep:) The more you play, the more strategy you pick up, but you don't even realize that until you've been playing for a while. I ordered qwirkle at the same time and we much prefer blockus! I especially like that it is basically self scoring. unlike quirkle, where you have to add up keep a running tally of your points.  Blockus is much easier for my 7 yr old to play with a friend or brother without adult assistance.The only negative I have is that the best way to play is with 4 players.  You CAN play with 2,or 3, but then the players have to double up and be in charge of 2 colors.  I would not let this keep you from getting the game, but just something to consider.",5.0
850,B001P06GX4,R3GWINNQSN742T,The games itself is fun and challenging especially for a geometry challenged person like ...,"  The games itself is fun and challenging especially for a geometry challenged person like myself. The game box looked like it was used. The corners and edges of the box were slightly worn and there were tape marks on the edge of the box. With that being said I really wanted the original version of the game...the one before the company ""updated"" the playing board. Previous reviewers noted how the original version had a larger playing surface and that is what I wanted. All the game pieces were their and in good shape so I didn't feel a need to return it. My 16 year old who is not a geometry person either won the game the first time she played it...her challengers had all played it several times already. She is a visual person which helped her in this game. It is a great and unique addition to our game library.",3.0

The cards feel nice, they aren't sticking together, and they don't bend easily (if you're not trying to bend them, of course). There is no card tray, so if that will be a problem, get one. There are some blank cards so you can make up your own, and they include some suggestions that I can see either being fun or, at least, entertaining to those watching.

So, so, so much better than Candyland and the never-ending game of Sorry!  When the Monopoly board comes out I immediately ask if they saw the UNO game anywhere!  I am not sure about the re-design and the new card that requires a re-deal.......just write the words out PLEASE!  ""What does that card mean?""  ""Not sure""  ""What happened to the instructions?""

The tin that holds the cards and instruction manual in is very durable and nice. It does take a little more space than the original cardboard box packaging but it is very well worth it. It's not too heavy either but keeps the cards nice and protective if you were to drop the pack or spill something onto it.

Lol but you get two deck and a tin. Nothing to crazy. Although it doesn't come with the rules but we know them so for us it doesn't matter. We love it. You will too. I'm had I got this rather than the box it normally comes in. That never lasts long and kids or my kids had a hard time getting into the box then it would RIP and we soon would have nothing to put it in then it's the rubberband to the rescue. Not anymore. Lol We just sent the kids to bed after playing this for about 2 hrs and its late and I'm slap happy. Have fun. Get the tin and enjoy your family time.

863,B07P6MZPK3,RS8IYSAJ1WEYZ,"Like the tin, wish it was smaller","  Our old Uno deck was chewed by the dog. I love the idea of the tin to keep the cards, but it‚Äôs too big. It has a plastic card holder inside which adds about an extra 2‚Äù to the size of the tin.

911,B00BYD5JMG,R1ZFW34HMXSRB,BOARD IS EASY TO MEMORIZE.  KIDS ARE STILL COMPETITIVE WHILE PLAYING.,"  Based on all the great reviews, I thought this would be a 'can't miss' kind of game.  Sadly, it seems to have missed in our household.  There are a few major flaws with this game that unfortunately I didn't see discussed in any of the reviews I read.Here's the premise of the game: Everyone takes turns spinning the spinner.  It either a) tells you how many spaces to move, b) has you remove a food from the pigs' picnic blanket (if all the food is removed the game is over) or c) has you turn over a Goldbug Card.  Each Goldbug card has a picture and corresponding word on it (ex: barrels, flags, cones, numbers, etc).  You have a minute to find as many of that item on the game board as possible.  When the minute is over, everyone moves forward based on how many of the item were found.  Everyone moves the same number, which is supposed to create teamwork and cooperation.Negatives:1. This board is easy to memorize.  After playing this game a few times my kids have memorized where tons of items are on the board.  It's not much of a look-and-find after the first few times you play it.2. Though this game is supposed to be about co-operation, my kids always seem to make this into a competition about who can find more items.  That wouldn't necessarily happen to every child who plays this, but I can't imagine my kids are the only ones who are competitive about something like this.  They actually argue more during this game than almost any other board game we have.Positives:1. This game is very simple and can be played by all ages.Obviously this game is loved by many, but be warned it's not perfect and won't work in every single household!  Since it worked for so many people it may still be worth a try.",3.0
912,B00BYD5JMG,R27I2SATJELDS7,Awesome game - read the instructions to undetstand rules of game,"  Wonderful game.  In the beginning we were confused and were not sure how to play.  This is one of those games that you actually have to read the instructions to understand how the game works - it isn't a pick it up and figure out the rules on your own kind of game.Once we actually read the instructions, it is so much fun.  My 2 year old loves this game and understands the rules with no problem.  These cards are printed with so much detail and the Disney theme is such a perk! I feel many of the negative reviews I read are because people dont know how to play and did not read the rules - ex. You are NOT going to find each item on each card - that's not the point of the game.  We have played this with many of our adult friends and with tons of kids (like I said my 2 year old is so good at this game and finds the most intricate details). It is easy to travel with and keeps kiddos entertained for hours - just read and learn what the rules are so you can enjoy the game and don't just try to figure it out or make up your own rules.",5.0
913,B00BYD5JMG,RGU2JBWTW565A,Don‚Äôt buy this disappointing game! Buy Busytown instead.,"  What a terrible disappointment. My kids and I LOVE busytown so I bought this version thinking it‚Äôd be even better with the Disney theme. Boy was I wrong. The game board has way too many spaces so the game takes a long time to successfully complete before the time runs out and the clock strikes midnight. So we‚Äôve still have never won this game. Also, the pictures on the game board are insanely tiny. Minuscule. It loses the fun when we‚Äôre all looking an inch away from the board to try to decipher the tiny pictures. Save your money. Don‚Äôt buy this game and buy Busytown! Busytown is fantastic, fast paced and fun for all ages. And the drawings are great.",1.0

My kids got excited and fell in love with the appearance of the game at the first sight.5 stars for the design of the game rules - The game is similar to BusyTown, but it involves longer path to the destination, the castle. It ties the story, Cinderella, to the game very well. Players need to arrive at the castle before the clock strikes 12.3 stars for the design of the game elements - The quantity of each object to be found is limited. Therefore, it does not really create an excitement when the players spin on the Mickey.2 stars for the graphic design - The objects to be found are drawn very small and difficult to find. The printed images are not sharp.2 stars for design to promote success - A good game for children challenges their skills as well as promote success. Especially when it is an cooperative game, the longer path to the castle and the difficulty to spot the items on the board hinder the success rate.When the kids were presented with the choice of ""World of Disney Eye Found It"" and ""BusyTown"", they chose the Disney version at first, but after a couple of times playing the Disney one, they have switched to BusyTown.",3.0
915,B00BYD5JMG,RT2LDD97K96EI,Best Game for Toddlers and Preschoolers!,"  Excellent game for toddlers and preschoolers!  This collaborative game (everyone works as a team) is so easy to learn and play.  For two to four players, the game board is three piece, six foot long puzzle.  After you set up the board, everyone has a marker.  There are about ten magnifying glasses, a cardboard boat, six cardboard pieces of food, cards, a spinner, and a timer.  The goal?  Everyone has to make it to the boat and the boat has to make it to Picnic Island before the pigs eat all the food. The youngest person goes first.Each player spins the spinner.  The arrow lands on either a Move, a Bug, or a Pig.  If you spin to a Move, you move your marker that many spaces and the next player goes.  If you spin to a Pig, the Pigs ""eat"" one picnic food item and you take one food items away and spin again.  If you spin to a bug, you pull a card.  When you pull the card, you have to look throughout the game board for those items (almost Where's Waldo style).  For example, if you pull a card with pictures of ""balloons"", you set the timer and look all around the game board for balloons.  You use the magnifying glasses to mark that you've found one.  When the timer is up you count how many ""balloons"" you found and all players move that many spaces.  So if you found three balloons, everyone moves three spaces.  Once everyone lands on the boat, everyone takes turns to spin to move the boat to Picnic Island.  So long as the pigs haven't eaten all the food, everyone wins!This game is a great concept for kids who have issues with winning and losing.  Especially at 3 and 4 years of age when other skills like patience, taking turns, and working together are my main focus for my son rather than learning to be a gracious loser (I hope to teach him this later).  Focusing and patience are the skills that this game builds as my son loves being a helper and the idea that he is helping for everyone to win actually helps him to focus and be a little more patient.  The game also helps with counting and memory.  I am pleasantly surprised by this game and I highly recommend it!",5.0

We had ages 4 to 37 playing the game 4 people at a time. That's as many as I'd recommend playing due to size and the find it rings. Which it would be awesome if they had more of them. With 4 people playing it's about 3 rings per person... but we've had players find more than 3 items before.Give the little ones more time but the game is alot of fun and well worth $20.I'd buy it again.,5.0
918,B00BYD5JMG,RZJRCDAESFSHB,"Great game for travel, not as good as the Board versions","  My children and us adults/parents play the large 6ft board Disney and Dreamworks Eye Found It games often and we love them all. Feel free to read my reviews on those other games. This game is a small spinoff travel version of the Disney Eye Found it board game, but with no board. It is simply a deck of cards. This game is great to keep in your purse or in the car for road trips.  My toddler loves to play it in waiting rooms, in the car, or wherever else a huge board game isn't practical. There are quite a few cards, each with a scene on the front and an object to search for on the back. The number of cards makes it nearly impossible to memorize the location of certain objects for next time. However, I wish there was an expansion pack with more cards to mix it up. I also wish the object on the back of the card was the one you need to find on the front of that same card- that is not the case. My daughter and I typically start with 5-7 cards in our hand, scene side towards us, and use the rest of of the deck to draw from the ""objects"" side to determine what we will search for in our hand. This works well because the object on the back of the card is rarely in the scene on the front of the card.  Whoever runs out of cards first (we discard a card from our hand once we find an object on it) wins. Once we've searched all of our cards for the current object on the draw pile, we discard that card and move on to a new object. I'm not sure how it's meant to be played, by how works best for us. I would recommend this game to anyone with young children, toddler and up, when you need a quick portable game to entertain them.",4.0

This delivered and then some!High-level notes:1. Kids love Disney2. The simplicity to this game is KEY3. No small pieces to lose on the move4. Even when not playing the game, kids still enjoy staring at the cards because...KIDS LOVE DISNEY!!!In all honesty, some of the items the cards name are not the easiest to find but the directions help clarify a bit of the confusion surrounding all of that.  At the end of the day though, feel free to ignore the preset rules/named items and just revert to the basics of ""I-Spy.""  Rather than spending the length of a [long] flight trying to point out random things on a plane that do not change, you can shuffle through a deck of cards with all of your favorite Disney characters and spend endless amount of time guessing at playful/beloved scenes!The nieces had a great time pulling this out during our flights/car rides, and it made for a welcome break from them staring into random screens!",5.0

It took us a little bit of time to get the hang of it--at first we were spending way too long looking through our pictures, but then we learned quickly that if we don't see the object in a few seconds to just move on.  Once we figured that out, the game went quickly, and we both loved playing it.

On the way to the island you may draw a search card that has everyone looking for items that match that image. The 6-year-old had fun and even the adults found  it interesting to  play with them. The game is well made and had sturdy cardboard. The game markers are large and well balanced so they are easy to move and don't  keep falling over.  It is especially nice if you have a long table to put it on so that you don't have to sit on the floor. We enjoyed this game so much, I want to buy one for each of my grown children and their families.",5.0
923,B00BYD5JMG,R10CDI8F2G8Y9O,Wonderful game for all ages.,"  My children and us adults/parents all love this game. We also have the Dreamworks version and play both often- but this one is better. The Disney characters are more well known, and the spaces are larger and easier to navigate than the Dreamworks version. This Disney game is definitely a family favorite because it is playable by all ages and is actually still fun for older children without boring them (unlike other games toddlers can play, such as Candy Land or High Ho Cherry O). The board is huge- it's as tall as long as my 6 ft husband if he lays next to it! For this reason, we typically break it in half and put it side by side to form a large square in the middle of our table instead of keeping it in the long thin line on the floor as intended. This game is easy enough to play for any age group, as long as the child can count to 10. My toddler daughter played it even before she could count on her own, and we just helped her with the counting of spaces when moving her pawn. She could still participate in the finding of objects, and it helped her learn what certain objects were that she didn't know before (barrel, musical note, anchor, etc.). It is so much fun to search for the hidden objects and see who can find the most! We've played it both as individuals and on teams. There are many objects to find and the board is huge, making it nearly impossible to memorize the location of certain objects for next time. I would recommend this game to anyone with children of any age, toddler and up! My toddler also enjoys the ""travel"" card version of this game.",5.0
924,B00BYD5JMG,R3AQKJGBBBG5H9,Great portable game for travel,"  This game is a brief version of the full game and so portable.

925,B00BYD5JMG,R15K2GAQ6ZIQVV,"Challenging But Super Fun Seek and Find Cooperative Game, Lots of Familiar Richard Scarry Characters","  I bought this as a Valentine's Day present for my 4 1/2 year old daughter and she loves this! She loves the Richard Scarry book ""Cars and Trucks and Things That Go"" (and specifically Goldbug) and this game has many of the same signature characters in it. In the box, you get the board which is in 3 pieces that you lock together like a puzzle, a timer, 4 large character movers, a spinner, 10 mini plastic orange magnifying glasses, a cardboard boat and cardboard food, and Goldbug mystery cards. I like that this game is a cooperative game in that there isn't one winner - you work as a team to find the objects on the board using the timer, which is great for the preschool set.To play you spin the spinner and if you spin a number, you move that number of spaces. If you spin Goldbug, you take a Goldbug mystery card and search for that object as a team all around the huge 6 foot long board (this is not a table game because of the size) and try to find as many of that object as you can together, putting a magnifying glass on the ones you find before the timer runs out. Everyone moves the number of spaces per object found. For instance, if you find 4 wrenches, everyone moves 4 spaces forward and then remove the magnifying glasses. If you spin ""Pigs Eat"" you take away one of the cardboard foods on the picnic blanket at the end of the board. At the end of the board path, there is a cardboard boat and all players have to get on before the boat can move to try to make it to the Picnic Island before the pigs eat all the food.We really love this game and it's great quality time and builds cooperation skills, thinking skills, and searching skills. The board itself is made pretty sturdily but you do have to fold the board to put it back in the box, so over time it does have the potential to get torn or split. I wish that they'd make the board thicker and just make it more than 3 puzzle pieces so you wouldn't have to fold it. I love that all the familiar characters are present and searching for the objects for Goldbug mysteries is actually quite challenging, even for adults, because the board is so busy with so many images on it. My daughter doesn't find it frustrating or overwhelming because she usually ends up finding more than me! Because there are so many objects to find, you really can't memorize where they are which keeps it challenging. I originally thought it would be better if the objects on the mystery cards would be printed in color instead of black and white, but I think they did that because the object isn't always the same colors on the board. Overall, this is made really well and lots of fun for our family to play!",5.0
926,B00BYD5JMG,R3NM1V6XU0B1RH,Great game for 4-10 year olds,"  My 4 year old daughter and our kids friends that are up to 10 years had so much fun playing this game. It goes really fast which is great for shorter attention spans. I hope to find some other themes and I will purchase those too! My husband and I enjoy playing this with our daughter. I actually prefer it over the larger game which we also have, it goes faster and is more portable (although that one is fun too)!Editing to say I believe the one I bought is the ‚Äúmulti‚Äù. It was only $6 when I purchased. I think that is a great value for this game. I have purchased a couple more for gifts.",5.0
927,B00BYD5JMG,R2NC4JQ54EBZZ1,Great Game for Eagle Eyed Kids,"  My kids love Richard Scarry's Busytown and this was bought for them for Christmas. The game point of the game is to get to the picnic area before the pigs eat all the food. There is not competition between players but against the ""pigs"" so this is a definite plus when playing with siblings. The youngest player goes first which is always a big hit for the youngest in the group. Each player gets a turn to spin and get either a number of spaces to advance, a choice of food to take from Picnic Island or to solve a GoldBug mystery. The GoldBug mystery consists of looking all over the 6-foot board for the object pictured on the GoldBug card. For every object you find you place a magnifying glass on it. The amount of objects you find is the amount of spaces everyone moves towards the ferry to go to Picnic Island.My kids love this game, however, it is above both the five year old and the two year olds (almost three) level of finding skills. I say this because the egg timer that comes with it runs an estimate of one minute. There is a lot of board to look at with only one minute of looking. Even with me helping the kids we were not able to find many objects within the time frame. While this will help make the game stay fresh for longer, the elder child got frustrated and the two year old lost interest. While the game says for 3 and up I personally think that the game is probably a better fit for at least five year olds and those that have a good attention span.The construction of the game was very sturdy and all pieces are well made. The colors are bright and the board is indeed very ""busy"". A con of the construction is that there are a lot of little pieces that can easily be lost, however, that is the only con regarding the design of this game. I gave four stars instead of five because of the time frame in which objects had to be found and because of my perception of the actual age group the game is directed at ( 5 versus 3).",4.0

We love the teamwork aspect of the game, as well as the way it ties so many of our favorite Disney movies together in one game.  We have this Disney version and a Richard Scary version, and I would say the Eye Found it series of games is a perfect family game.  It helps kids to learn new words, what different things look like, as well as provides them an opportunity to develop their searching capabilities.

930,B00BYD5JMG,R2V13O6PHFV2AY,Fun game for all ages,"  Love it. I have a 3 and 7 year old. Both love the game. We've changed the rules a little bit, as there are some issues you can run in to. For instance, when you spin, if you land on the castle clock it adds up fast, and the game ends when you get to 12. We now play that if you land on the 2 clock to add 2, you instead just lose your turn. And, we don't spin again after landing on the clock. We also play whoever gets to the castle wins, not everyone wins. But, I appreciate the collaboration of the game in eye spying.",4.0

Very well thought of family game.,5.0
932,B00BYD5JMG,R1H1VUS44UNCT6,This game was lots of fun for the whole family,"  This game was lots of fun for the whole family. I got it last Christmas (a year ago) for my daughter and she continues to ask to play it. It isn't a game you buy and just let in the closet. One reason the game is so good is that it can be played by all ages. My 6 year old, 10 year old, as well as my husband and myself can play it. It's pretty big, about 12x24 inches or so. The objective is to move your piece to the end but the fun is in searching for the hidden pictures. One of the spins is ""mikey's ears"" which indicates you pick a card, set the sand timer, and everyone looks for the hidden pictures on the board (from the card). Everyone gets pieces to place on the pictures they find and when the times up, you count how many were found and everyone gets to move that number of spaces. This encourages everyone to look on everyones turn. Overall, I think it's a great game and I would probably buy another EYE FOUND IT! in other editions. There are enough cards and pictures that there's no way you would remember where everything is. The game was just as challenging the last time we played as it was the first time.",5.0

My 4 year old has sometimes got discouraged when she can‚Äôt find an item before the time runs out, but that will get better and easier as she learns and plays the game. The game board is BIG. It doesn‚Äôt fit in our dining room table so we have to play on the floor.

It is fun that it is sooo big, but that is also a downfall as they don't even know where to begin to look for the items on the cards. Also, because it is so big, the board folds into itself and it fits together like puzzle pieces once you open it up. Well, one of the folded over pieces of game board (not puzzle side) already broke apart. I realize this is bound to happen with games, but it was literally on our first use. Overall, I think this is one where the kids do need to be at least 4 to play.",4.0
935,B00BYD5JMG,R57KFDTI6IKRC,The first toy/game in our home that gets 5 stars across the board,"  Busy Town has quickly established itself as a family favorite and our three- and five-year old absolutely LOVE it.  They're not quite old enough to play it without supervision, but after a few weeks with this game, I wouldn't be surprised if they're playing by themselves in the next 6 months or so.  Right now, we play it as a family - the goal is a ""team victory"" and it's far less competitive than many other games.  Even our 20-month old cooperates and helps out, often holding the timer or ""removing a piece of food from the picnic blanket"" when the game calls for it.We've purchased or received three other boardgames for our family in the last couple of months and none have been as enjoyable and educational as this one.  There are two that I would recommend against: (1)¬†

Chutes and Ladders Disney Princess

  ¬†was beloved for a few days by our daughter, but has been largely forgotten; and (2)¬†

Candyland - The World of Sweets Board Game

  ¬†is not as durable and while the kids enjoy it, mom and dad do not.  The other game that we WOULD RECOMMEND is¬†

Sequence for Kids

  .  The kids love the Sequence game and there's enough strategy involved that mom and dad stay engaged.  It's probably a little bit too advanced for our kids and the overall educational value is probably not as high as Busy Town, but it's also a five-star recommendation from us and we're enjoying it immensely.Educational value on Busy Town is high as the game is good at getting our kids to count the number of spaces they need to move, doing basic math for determining how many they need to get, searching for certain objects, and building vocabulary as we talk about the different objects on the board.  The board is huge - stretching out 6 feet - and everything is very durable.  We lay it out on the floor and all move around as we're searching for the objects.  Highly recommended for 3-8 year olds and for family play!!",5.0
936,B00BYD5JMG,R32OV7DDZ96YI5,Excellent Skill Building Across Age Groups,"  My 6 and 3 year old boys LOVE this game. They absolutely love Trucks & Cars & Things That Go, so I suspected this game would be a hit and it is. As a parent, I love the collaborative aspect and I find the Goldbug cards challenging myself, which means I don‚Äôt mind playing this game over and over, because it keeps my interest.It‚Äôs a fantastic game for kids of differing ages, as they can be taught varying concepts. My 6 year old learns about collaboration, strategy in determining where items might be found and working against a clock. My 3 year old is learning the concept of going the number of spaces he‚Äôs spun, rather than as many as he chooses, and identifying objects. I show him an example, we set the timer and I guide him to look in a narrower region, and often ignore the clock running out. It is very easy to modify the rules to suit your needs.We play on the floor, so we don‚Äôt find space to be an issue.Truly excellent skill building game.",5.0

I have a few criticisms:  the board is too long for the average dinner table and playing it on the floor is too hard on the knees.  The objects you are trying to find are teeny, so wear glasses.  And, the sand timer gives you very little time to find anything.  We altered the rule about the clock hands, so we stood a better chance of getting to the end.  I do like that it is a cooperative game and everyone moves together to get to the end.  If you like looking for hidden pictures, this is a great children's game.",4.0

941,B01ALHAIWG,R6P8F4TUXAF2B,I really liked this edition,"  I really liked this edition. I used to have the 1998 edition as a kid, so the idea of only 5 armies, and cardboard containers was offputting to say the least. However, after having played the game again several times with my buddies, I do agree that 6 armies is too much for the actual gameboard. Even with 5 the board feels very crowded and there is a lot of pressure on the 5th player to find their footing, with 6 players, I can clearly see that someone would be eliminated within the first 3 or 4 turns. The cardboard containers are not as nice as the plastic ones that came with the 1998 edition, but they serve their purpose well. The game board lists that there are 40 infantry pieces per army, but all the armies in mine had 2 extra infantry pieces. The cards are built well enough, and the game includes the secret mission cards which can shorten the length of the game significantly. A lot of territories have different names in this edition, but i believe their placement and borders are all the same as before.  Overall I am very satisfied with the gameboard.",5.0

I remembered reading a review on here saying they were included, just in a weird spot. So I looked in each little Army box, and finally found them in the Indigo/Purple colored box. So before you return your game, look in each box and double check, and look under the army figures too. I was prepared to buy the dice separately, if missing, but they were there.The game itself looks great, I was really impressed by the boxes full of the colored armies, such a nice way to keep organized. The figures are small and lightweight, but they seem decent, and they'll be better to play with than the little chips in some other versions of the game. All-in-all, I'm very pleased with the purchase.",5.0
944,B01ALHAIWG,R634XCF53ZECQ,Risk Game,"  I've never played the game before so it took about 3 full games to fully grasp the rules and concept.To break down the set up for anyone wanting to buy it;1. Seperate secret mission and land cards from each other.2. Deal out secret mission cards; 1 per person (you could win by completing it)3. Remove the 2 wild cards (has the infantry, horse, and cannon on one card) from the land cards and deal them all out. The last 2 players usually claim an extra land piece.4. Each player receives a set amount of troops (check rule book). Place 1 troop on all the places listed on your given land cards.5. Return the land card to the dealer and start placing your remaining troops on your land. And done you have set up the game and o yeah the dice are in one of the troop boxes.Note:Somethings that I discovered or want to clarify1. Moving your troops to place you own concludes your turn.2. You could only receive one Risk territory card per turn after you conquer a piece of land.3. You can only redeem territory cards at the beginning of your turn and any territory you own on the card receives a +2 troops.4. There's a route from Alaska that leads to Asia.",5.0
945,B01ALHAIWG,R1BLLGJML2Z8XR,A classic!,"  My son is into plenty of electronic games - be they tablet, console, PC, etc. - so I wanted to get him an actual board game to play for once.  I had fond memories of playing Risk with my friends 20+ years ago, and when I went looking for it Amazon had the best price.  The game has actually gotten better - the version I had included the old-school Roman numeral pieces, and the new ones look much better.  I also really like the addition of the Secret Mission way to play, because it's a much shorter game and you can finish a game in less than an hour if need be.",5.0

The instructions explain 4 different ways to play; Secret Mission, Classic, Risk for 2 players, and Capital. It is great to have the choices. Secret mission risks seems to shorten the length of play, so when time is a factor, we play that version. My 5 year old even plays. He can play on a team with an adult.",5.0

The map board looks great! We opened it for our first play this past weekend.The game is great because you can play as a beginner or with an advanced strategy. You'll develop plans of where to start your armies, what favorite territories you like, etc. The instructions are easy enough to follow for people without any experience playing Risk.Bring snacks, drinks, and buckle up for a head-to-head fight over land!Great purchase!",5.0

955,B01ALHAIWG,R13R3F01QXQ9ZO,A Good Edition of a Classic Strategy Game,"  It's your standard Risk game with the classic 6 different colored armies (red, blue, green, yellow, pink, and... black, which is really brown), decks of territory and secret mission cards, dice, board, and rulebook in a box.The pieces are really nice. They are larger than previous versions (comparing to the 1998 and 2003 releases of the game) and have some nice detail to them.Gameplay is still the same. Although it is enjoyable for those new to strategy games, seasoned veterans may find it to be a bit dull. If you want to spice it up, I recommend getting 4-5 boxes of this version and 4-5 boxes of the $16.99 version (for an additional two colors: orange, and indigo... which is really black), print and laminate 3' √ó 4' maps from the 1995 PC game, 5 sets of 12-sided dice (white, yellow, green, red, and black), and get a copy of Same-Time Risk (game variant from the 2000 PC game) rules from the internet. I got some of my buddies hooked on it, and it truly immerses you into a more complex, exciting, and challenging game while keeping some of the same classic mechanics.If you're a novice to strategy games, this is a classic. If you want a more realistic, Napoleonic-style game, go with my recommendation in the last paragraph.",4.0
956,B01ALHAIWG,RD48HNRH9EO59,Dissapointing!!!,"  The product is well designed and a total eye candy, the box it self was very cool to look at. However, the box was partially damaged and the soldier pieces were poor quality. Regular versions have higher quality pieces. Quality of the product was certainly most unpleasing experience. I was very excited to receive the copy and hyped after seeing the box lid and the design effort that was put into it. Unfortunately once you open the box and lok into individual token cases, its an reality shattering experience.I would recommend only if you are a hardcore risk fan and have other risk games to replace the parts, that's what I'm going to do. Otherwise just stick to the regular ones. They have higher quality.",2.0
957,B01ALHAIWG,R2FP82UF0VDUYU,Storage box to small and flimsy,"  I give this 4 stars because of the game box and board are a pure joy to look at, but the storage boxes for the individual armies are too small and flimsy.  You will have to play Tetris to be able to get all your armies pieces back into their storage containers then spend a few more minutes trying to line up the little flimsy carboard flaps to close the tray. Would have been nice to get the little clear plastic army trays in this version instead of the paper thin, to small, flimsy carboard ones. That is my only real complaint about the 60th anniversary edition, it is still a wonderful game, and the game box and game board more then make up for the crappy army trays",4.0

For under $20 you can get a beautiful edition of Risk that will entertain (and challenge) you, family and friends for years. This edition features wonderful graphics for the map and cards. The sculpts of the pieces are really well done. I have loved many editions of Risk but I think this one is the most fun. Also, the regular 60th Anniversary edition (which is also awesome) uses the same graphics with a different coloration and textures and 6 armies rather than 5. Both are excellent editions.",5.0
961,B01ALHAIWG,R15I76U40ZR83C,waste of money,  I have owned the same risk game for over 20 years and this year we decided to replace it as over the years we have lost one or two of the little men.  I cannot express my disappointment in the quality of the new game I purchased.  The figures are cheap plastic that wont even stand up on the board and the flimsy thin cardboard holders for the cards and game pieces will surely not last a minute.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,1.0
962,B01ALHAIWG,RNDY7E1P6SWHH,A Basic Edition of a Classic Strategy Game,"  It's your standard Risk game with 5 different colored armies (orange, blue, green, yellow, and... indigo, which is really black) instead of your traditional 6, decks of territory and secret mission cards, dice, board, and rulebook in a box.The pieces are really nice.

964,B01ALHAIWG,R2MWLA6BXR2EC,Great game but beware of damage,"  The game itself was a lot of fun and the decoration of the box is great. I was however disappointed that it was banged up and had some tears on the exterior and interior. All of the pieces were fine and the board was perfect but the box itself had some issues.

ITD the same awesome game but it‚Äôs rare these days that a board game‚Äôs quality exceeds the earlier versions. Everything is boxed so nicely! I think this will definitely last many many years to come. We got this to play as a family while sheltering in place. It‚Äôs a little too advanced for my 7yo so we end up playing as a team but my gifted 9yo absolutely loves it and actually won several times. So don‚Äôt be afraid of the older age recommendations if you have a smart kid that would be interested in taking over the world :),5.0

It takes quite some time to play a 2 person game but we just start a game, leave it out on the table & do a few battles at a time throughout the week, until one of us conquers the world.

971,B07T446163,R17PTKSG72GS1A,Totally Unique and Thought-Provoking Party Game,"  This is a really clever party game, never played anything like it. There are a TON of cards with a great variety of ‚Äúscales‚Äù from simple (hot to cold, boring to exciting) to funny (hairy to hairless, smelly in a good way to smelly in a bad way) to pop culture (Slytherin to Gryffindor, light side to dark side) to intelligent (non-partisan to partisan). We played this tonight with our 4 and 6 yr old kids. We definitely had to stick with only the simple scale cards but they actually understood the concept and really enjoyed it.  The discussions were fun and the moment of reveal was super exciting.The quality of the game is very high, the plastic pieces are all thick. I was a little nervous about my kids handling it but as long as you teach them how to do it correctly it seems pretty solid. My only complaint is the score marker pieces are cardboard making them vulnerable to bending and liquids.I think playing this with a group of outgoing and fun adults would be a total blast! I will update review once we do that.",5.0
972,B07T446163,RCX76BSQYZSWK,Certain to be one of my most played games of 2020 - even with 2 players!,"  This is a great game. At the time of this review, I have logged 15 plays of this game.Quick summary of how the game works. You get a category that is some sort of continuum like from ""bad actor"" to ""great actor"" and then you get a secret place somewhere randomly on that range that you have to get your team to guess.  Then you have to come up with a clue that tries to get your team to guess that same place on the wheel. It's really easy to think of an actor who is really great or really bad, right? But what if you need to come up with an actor who is midway between good and bad. And will your team select the same spot?1) The slidey mechanism to hide the secret spot on the wheel works great.2) This game is incredibly replayable.  There are some cards in this deck that I've remarked ""wow, you could play a whole game using just this card.3) It's very easy to explain when you have the wheel in front of your to show people. If my explanation above didn't make precise sense, that's ok. Once you have the wheel in front of you and do an example, people get it immediately4) Surprising, the 2 player co-op version of the game is great. There are not many party games where you can say that.  How the 2 player version works is you go through 7 cards and get as many points as possible. BUT ALSO if your partner guesses the clue exactly right, you get to add another card to the deck. So it's very fun to see just how high of a score you can get. We have had some terrible scores and we have had some amazing scores.This is a wonderful game and a very novel idea.",5.0
973,B07T446163,R25FJBA6FK4OPU,Fun party game - collaborative & competing team modes are both fun,"  Bought this game because my friend recommended it's great for parties. It's very easy to learn and play. I'm a big fan of Codename pictures and this kinda/sorta requires the same logic, but is a lot more approachable/moves a lot faster - i.e. it doesn't require nearly as much time to think of a description if you are the player tasked with giving a clue. I've played with multiple groups and everyone enjoyed playing. The collaborative team play can be as fun as the competitive play.",5.0
974,B07T446163,R1HAB196QHPFVX,"Great simple, fast party game",  I played this for the first time a couple of days ago and it was a big hit with my gaming group. We played it in between playing heavier games. A lot of the fun depends on how well you know those you're playing with.,5.0

979,B07T446163,R3PAW6C0MK5V4Y,Great party game for creative players,"  This is an awesome game!  It's a lot of fun trying to find the right clue that will guide your team to score, so it's great for creative players.  If a player picks a card that they find too difficult, you can allow players to use either side of the card, their choice.  You can play with a large number of people, depending on how many players you're comfortable with on a team (considering that they have to discuss their guess before presenting it).  We played with 4 on a team and the game was a bit short, so some players only got to be ""the Psychic"" once.  But you can always play again, since it's quick enough, or simply play to double the score that the scoring track allows.",5.0
980,B07T446163,RHSP2ICH5YMEO,The follow-up hit to Monikers!,"  So Monikers is one of my favorite games (look it up if you haven't heard of it). So when I heard that Alex was designing another game, my interest was immediately piqued. Add that to the fact that he partnered with Wolfgang Warsch (The Mind, The Quacks of Quedlinburg), I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. And it did not disappoint!This is a play on one of those ""get your friends to guess the word"" game but instead there is a ""spectrum"" of areas and you are trying to guide your team to the correct area of the range through a clue. There is a lovely plastic dial that has quite the table presence and serves its function perfectly.It's been awhile since I have had a party game hit with my group like Wavelength did. Expect a lot of laughs and interesting conversations on what is and isn't a sandwich. It is one of my favorite party games of the last few years.",5.0
981,B07T446163,R2465GU2545TY4,Fun Party Game for the Family,"  This game will have you trying to figure out where on the wavelength a word exists between two polar opposite items. Only in a game like this will you be arguing about where Oprah exists on a scale from Evil to Good. I mean, she is certainly on the Good side, but is she the most good thing out there? The clue giver didn't say something like Gandhi, so potentially not all of the way to the good side, but where then would Oprah fall? She did give a bunch of people a car which is pretty great.The conversations are so ridiculous and fun which makes this a fantastic party game. There are options for everyone playing on the same team or having two teams which makes it good for a large variety of player sizes. If you are a fan of Codenames, this game has a lot of similarities to that game while still being very unique.",5.0
982,B07T446163,RY7T21HWX0B1S,A blast of a party game!,"  My game group and I discovered this at Dice Tower West and absolutely loved it. It's very simple to learn and so fun to play with a group of friends. One bonus is that the player count doesn't really matter.  I think it says it plays with 2, but I would say 4 or up would be most fun - the more the merrier for this game, actually.It's one of the best type of group party games where the scores don't really matter and we just play until we don't feel like playing anymore.  It also doesn't require that you actually do anything silly, which my group does not typically go for. It's all about the discussion of the spectrum that you're trying to get your team to guess. The quality is great and has very well made components.My ONLY criticism is not game-related - I hate the way it looks.  Don't let the hideous box cover art fool you though, it's a great game and worth the buy.",5.0

The design of the game is wonderful, I appreciate the thoughtfulness and artistry that went into it.

My kids, along with my nieces and nephews (ranging from 6-16) were laughing uncontrollably the entire time. The phrase possibilities are as creative and funny as you can make them. I think my 8 year old had the best time. He literally said the next morning after our first night of playing that his stomach was sore. If you‚Äôre one of those parents who get offended easy...you should definitely get this game and learn to loosen up a bit. We need to be able to laugh especially nowadays. And if we can‚Äôt do that with our kids, then who can you do that with. Great game and will be recommending it to all of my friends.",5.0

I simply remove some cards based on the crowd playing with the game. We adults enjoy it too.

There‚Äôs still A LOT of suggestive cards, and about a dozen ‚Äúmaybe not‚Äù cards that I separated and left in the box labeled (pictured).

There were a couple duplicates, as well.  Overall, it‚Äôs mostly potty humor and general things that will just sound funny when you put it with something else. But even after pulling out the dozen cards there‚Äôs still some on the gray line. Eg: ‚Äúwhere do babies come from‚Äù ended up with ‚Äúturkey baster‚Äù, ‚Äúthe circle of trust‚Äù and ‚Äúmom jeans‚Äù.  If you‚Äôre looking for a clean game for the family, this won‚Äôt be it.  I‚Äôd say age 10+, after pulling some raunchy inappropriate cards.  Every family is different though.

I'm not a prude, but I felt this game could have been made so much more appropriate with very little effort on the part of the creators.

I saw several reviews complaining about the card quality and how easily they get damaged. I have worked in the casino industry for years and have seen all different qualities of cards. I was a pleasantly surprised to find the card quality was not bad at all. Not top of the line by any means but plastic coated. I found the cards to be about the same size as Pokemon and Magic cards. Being a bit of a nerd I had lots of extra sleeves for my daughter and I's card collections. I sleeved the exploding kittens deck. It should last much longer that way. I highly recommend this game it's fun. I will be buying expansions soon.psYou can pick up Penny sleeves at any hobby shop that sells magic or Pokemon cards.

1034,B010TQY7A8,RELUDA2VECP3T,A great party version of the base game...with some caveats for owners of the original,"  Love this game and the party version plays like the SFW original and has some of the imploding kittens expansion cards except the Reversal card and Imploding kitten. There are enough cards to play up to 10 players as stated on the box but the deck itself is separated by a 2-3 player deck and a 4-7 player deck. The two decks combined make for 8-10 player games. The Attack and Targeted Attack cards are changed to ""double slap"" and ""triple slap"" function similarly as targeted attack but now stack if players play them in tandem, getting rid of the gray area of playing multiple attack cards in a row.As much as I didn't want to do so because the game itself deserves 5-stars, I had to ding a star for the party version. The card backs are different than the original game so RIP expanding this version with any of the current/upcoming expansions. Also, it's not plastic wrapped from the outside which didn't make much sense to me and the 2-3 and 4-7 player decks aren't separated from one another so a very tedious sorting was needed prior to use. Also, when playing with 4 players, the 4-7 player deck is very noticeably slower, so if you like faster kitten games, modify as appropriate. Played fine when playing with 6 players and the full 10 players. That being said though, the concept of the ""party"" pack begged the question to me, why don't I just get another base copy of the game to account for larger gettogethers? I ultimately shelved this copy for display (or plan to give this copy away to a friend who didn't own kittens later on) and plan to buy a other base copy to follow in the same spirit as the party pack.New players, I'd say if you want to have a game with more than 5-6 players as is in the vanilla, get two copies of the base deck and the expansion to get the full flavor of cards this game has (about the same price as the party pack when on sale). You'll also be future proofing for further expansions going forward.For die hard kitten fans, this is still a fine addition to your game collection and definitely some fan service is in the box (not going to spoil). It's also a great gift copy for occasions where >6 players are needed and most of the player-base will be new players.",4.0

It was a huge hit, especially with the kids, because what 6-year-old doesn't love exploding kittens? (At least conceptually.) It took a little bit of explaining and coaching to get the kids up to speed but after that they ruled the table like the merciless sociopaths kids are. They will throw you into the path of an exploding kitten card without thinking twice.Seriously though, this is a great game for kids and adults, and so it's fun for family game nights. Kids can play on the same level as adults and they love that.I ended up donating my original to the games pile at an AMC hut on our last group hiking trip (shout out Lonesome Lake).

This game would be worth $20 for a deck of cards IF it were a deck of cards that could endure the treatment of children.Not only that, but even when we first got the game, I did all of the card handling. Even when I was shuffling the new deck of cards, edges of the cards started peeling back during the simple shuffling process. Just within the first few games. Which seems easily avoidable since playing cards have been around for quite some time now. It's not new technology or anything.My 7yo cheats, and peeled edges on cards can be used to cheat.Choose a new printing service, and you'll get 5 stars from me.

We love it, and would give the game five stars except for two issues.  The first is that it is simply a card game.  Paying $20 for a deck of cards seems a bit steep to me.  However, honestly, that  wouldn't bother me as much if not for the second issue.  The production quality of the cards are low.  Most of the regular decks of cards I've played lasted longer than these.  Within a few weeks, we were seeing wear on the cards that took some of the mystery out of what was in another players hands.  Now, after about 20 games, every card is marked by wear on the edges.  I would encourage the game developers to invest in a thicker card with a heavier wax like the ones many other card decks are made with.  If you purchase the game, and you have a laminator, it may be wise to laminate before gameplay so the cards last a long time.  If they do, it will be well worth having.

1040,B010TQY7A8,RBEU2FP9CT0EP,Great Game - Poor Card Quality,"  I'm breaking this review down into two categories:  Gameplay and Quality of Product.Gameplay:  Excellent.  Really fun game that the entire family can play.  As adults, we'd rather play this than a lot of other family style/card games.  We also have a 13 year old, 6 year old and a 4 year old.  Our older boy is the one who suggested it and it was a hit.  Took about 2 open-hand games and 2 assisted games to get our 6 year old going, but after that he was good to go.  Our 4 year old can even play on her own now after a couple weeks of watching and sitting with us...she really doesn't need much help.There's definitely a strategy involved and each game is quite different.  Where it can get tough, is if an older player is very strategic and the younger players are more basic (like most games).  There's a lot more to it, than say Uno.  Overall, for gameplay, it gets 5 STARS!Quality of Product:  This where the stars drop for me.  First, for $20, I was expecting more than just a deck of cards.  I didn't know what the game was but figured there would be more than just a deck in the box when I opened.  In the end, I'm fine with the price.  It's a great game.  BUT, the quality of the cards is about as cheap as you can get.We've had the game for a few weeks and played it quite a bit, but that cards are literally falling apart already.  The corners are peeling apart a couple are ripped a little bit, just from normal shuffling.  They're so floppy now, it's difficult to even shuffle them.  Several cards are easy to pick out, based on the blemishes.  This is especially tough when it comes to the Kitten or Defuse cards, the two most important sets of cards in the game.  It changes everything if you can pick out a Kitten just by looking at the back side.It sucks, because I would seriously consider buying the expansion pack but the difference in the cards will be so noticeable, I'm not sure it would be worth it.  Pretty disappointing because, like I said, it's a great game....the quality of the cards is just so low.  They really should be more laminated, like a good set of Bicycle cards or something, especially because it's not like you can just go out and quickly (and cheaply) pick up another deck.  I'd rather have less packaging and better cards.Soooo, yes, I would definitely recommend the game, just don't expect it to last too long.",3.0

This is useful when you know someone is out to get you.o Target Attack, which is played like an attack, but you get to pick the player you wish to attack.o Feral cat, which is like a wild (haha!) card for cat cards! These definitely change the game.o Imploding kitten, which cannot be diffused! The addition of this card also allows for 6 players instead of the old maximum of 5.You also receive a human-sized Cone of Shame for the first person to forget which player's turn is next. My daughter is WAY more excited about this than I am. That's probably the point.You can choose to play with ANY OR ALL of the new expansion cards. Pick and choose your favourites! The only thing I feel must be noted is that several of the new action cards are for playing with 3 or more players. Choosing who to attack or reversing order, for example, wouldn't make a difference in a 2 player game.The artwork is hilarious, as expected from The Oatmeal. Overall, if you are a fan of Exploding Kittens, this expansion is pretty much a necessity, especially if you often play with a group.",5.0

We have played it a hundred times in less than a month that we have had it.  We've played it every time we have friends over.So why only 3 stars?Because there is a major flaw:The cards are already falling apart.  They just don't last. The quality is equal to a cheap deck of cards, not a high quality deck. Don't be confused by the pictures, YOU ARE BUYING A DECK OF CARDS for $20... which I would have no problem with if the quality of the cards was so that it would last.  If you're going to sell me a deck of cards for $20 please improve the quality so that they will last.  It is crazy fun. Is it fun enough to pay another $20 for another deck when this one finally gives out? probably not.",3.0

1046,B010TQY7A8,R9CHUF5LFIVC5,Distinguishing card issue fixed,  When I first got this expansion and read the reviews I was seeing some people complain that the expansion cards were differently sized and colored which got me a bit worried. Luckily however it looks like the issue has been fixed. The only difference is the side of the stack looks whiter than my well loved deck which has turned a slight parchment color over time. That however isn't the company's fault. But when mixed you would't be able to tell especially when looking down as you would when playing.People were definitely right about the large amount of packaging making this expansion about the size of a tall children's book.The actual cards add a delightful degree of strategy and variety to the main game. Can't wait to play and would say this expansion was well worth it.Now if only the bonus cards you get separately in other merchandise like the keychains weren't so distinguishing that'd be great. But that's another product entirely.,5.0

I never really heard about this game before, but saw it as an alternative to Cards Against Humanity for my son. I bought it for my sone who is 16 and autistic. I wanted a card game that I can play with him or others that wasn't childish or rude. This game was so much fun! It's not rude, but it is funny. There is sarcastic humor, but not the crude kind even though the name would suggest something else. We played it with my 8 year old nephew and it was easy to learn. I found that glancing at the rules and then just diving in an checking the rules as you go was the best way to learn. It was easy to learn if you didn't study the instructions like a technical manual that you were going to be tested on. The cards also have the instructions on them, so getting the basics down was the only essential and the basics was that your turn finished when you drew a card from the pile. Great game for anyone 7 and up I think.",5.0

There are several completely new cards which I won't spoil, but they are really game changing! and there are also some enhanced versions of old cards like see the future 5x instead of 3x which is nice to get something new rather than just more of a duplicate which wouldn't feel like it's adding anything. The art is still very amusing.Overall I highly recommend the expansion to anyone with the base game the new cards really change it up and will take your games to another level.",5.0

1052,B010TQY7A8,R1HK5OF5XGTT86,Inconsistent size and color? - check if you got a fake original edition!,"  After playing Exploding Kittens at a friends house I decided that I needed to have this in my game collection as well. I purchased the original Exploding Kittens game, the Streaking Kittens expansion as well as the Imploding Kittens expansion pack on Amazon a little while ago. The game itself is fabulous but I do have a huge issue with the difference in quality and size for all three items.  The original is somewhat pale red in appearance, has no texture and measures approximately 62mmx87mm per each card  The first expansion is darker in color, has a grid like texture and measures approximately 63mmx88mm per each card  The second expansion is darker shade of red in color, has a grid like texture and measures approximately 63mmx88mm per each cardThis might seem mediocre to some people but fact is that the size difference makes shuffling quite awkward. The color and texture difference further enables some really attentive players to figure out what the opponent has on hand. I have included some pictures of my cards as well. Hoping to be able to purchase another set of these cards with identical quality, size and appearance to make playing this game more fun.UPDATE: Well, it appears that some exploding kittens versions sold here are cheap knock of versions which results in inconsistent size and color issues as described by me in above. Meanwhile I have gotten The Original edition directly from the manufacturer and here are some pictures of my two versions.Original Box: is darker shade of read and reads ORIGINAL EDITION in the top right corner, has cut outs on the sides for easy opening, has holographic stick in the back next to the barcode, the card tray is flat black in color and deep enough to accommodate the entire original edition AND expansion packs and (as described in above) there is a size and texture difference between knock off and  the real deal.Fake Box: Is slightly lighter in color and does NOT have the original edition written in the top right corner, no cut outs on the sides for easy pening, no holographic sticker in the back, very shallow shiny cheap card tray that barely accommodates the original edition cards.Hoping this info helps others! If you too received a knock off at your first try I suggest you DEMAND a refund!",3.0

1054,B010TQY7A8,R8DFFWZP1GXR,It's da bomb! But in an imploding way...,"  One might think, upon first inspection, that there is way too much packaging material for a mere 20 cards to expand one's Exploding Kittens core game. However, upon opening the box, one would discover that not only are there the expected 20 brand new cards, illustrated by the Oatmeal, but also a plastic divider and.... no drumroll, please (you'll scare the kitties)... a Human Cone of Shame! ""What in the name of the Oatmeal's Holy Name would you do with a Human Cone of Shame?"" one might ask. I'm glad one asked! One would have to wear it until the end of the game if one forgot it was their turn to play!The Imploding Kitten card is diabolical. When drawn, it must be put back in the deck, face up, and the next person to draw it is out of the game, period. No Defuse card may be played, and it cannot be noped. Suddenly, that Shuffle card you drew three rounds ago just became a lot more important, didn't it?The ability to reverse the order of play, a la Uno, also adds a new twist.As always, the cards are beautifully done.The game remains a pleasure to play, as I do often with my work friends during lunch.

The backs were closer in color, but were unfortunately still noticeably different (smooth vs. textured cards).I ended up sleeving the cards, and by taking out the insert, the sleeved core deck and expansion still fight in the original box.The expansion itself is great, and I highly recommend getting it if you're a fan of the base game.

1059,B010TQY7A8,R1PXY35DF7QT1B,Maybe not for old people,"  I bought the original version for my grandparents for Christmas because they love cards games and I will say old people won‚Äôt understand this game. It was way too weird and confusing for my old people.I‚Äôm giving the game 4 stars because the instructions are kind of confusing. We never knew if you were supposed to maintain 5 cards at all times or if it didn‚Äôt matter. We didn‚Äôt have internet connection to watch the online instructions so we just had the paper instructions which should have been enough, but they weren‚Äôt very clear.It also was confusing when my grandmother was out of cards but hadn‚Äôt gotten an exploding cat yet (had used her diffuse card as her last card to diffuse the cat) and my grandfather still had cards so he went and got an exploding cat. So does that mean my grandma who didn‚Äôt even have cards was the winner?Overall we had a laugh, but there‚Äôs was a bit too much left to the imagination for a true card player.",4.0
1060,B010TQY7A8,R12RCG8K7XSS01,Adds a Lot More to the Game!,"  As a person that has purchased the core game and first expansion, I was excited to see that a second expansion was available. Even more so that it was on pre-sale for $5. My friends and I love playing the game, so more variation is better, right?After receiving the expansion, my first impressions was, that there are quite a few new options available for actions. The cards are of equal quality to the original cards. In general, I am looking forward to trying this expansion out. I will update this review once I do.Now, why isn't this a 5 star review? Simply put, they seemed to cheap out on some of the action cards. Several are duplicates, instead of having a new, and interesting image for each card. Mixing the lack of play, and this cop-out, I would put this at 4 stars. removing the lack of play, I would call this expansion a 4.5 star expansion. It is a relatively minor gripe.Please keep in mind, that this is a first impression. I still think the expansion is worth while to buy. Particularly if you love the core game, and previous expansion. It adds quite a bit to the game. I kinda wish it had come with 1-2 more defuse cards too, but that is more of a wish than need.",4.0

1062,B00000IWD0,R1DNSN6IPH7YTY,great educational and character building game,"  okay, hear me out. I know that the title makes it sound heavy but the premise of the game is that you can ""knock"" other players off the board and take their spot if you draw a certain card. Can anyone see how this might upset a 7 or 5 year old? I have one of each and we play weekly. They have come to understand that 'what goes around, comes around' and have developed each week a better attitude toward the times when they are 'down' as opposed to 'up.' They have also learned to be graceful towards a bad temporary outcome. Basic math is necessary and I have seen my 5 year old's counting improve since we started playing. I was really happy to see them enjoy the game and pleasantly surprised to see the character building value of the game. About the 4th time we played they stopped just trying to get each other back and started to think more strategically. Thanks Hasbro (please don't turn this into a movie)",4.0

This is a wonderful teaching tool on several levels. First of all, I use dice instead of the cards that are included, and I make the kids count out loud as they play, so that it teaches counting.  Second of all, it's a great way to encourage social interaction. Because the idea is to land on someone else's token, the kids have to interact. My students have different native languages, and when they play this game, they don't need to speak each other's languages to have fun. As they become more proficient in English, they can also interact better verbally. Plus, the nature of the game is that it's so spontaneous and fun that they don't worry as much about mistakes as they do during structured class time. This is a great activity for Friday class periods when nobody wants to work much anyway, and they don't realize that their teacher is making them practice English. :-)",5.0

I have used it a lot when working with kids.  It's not too complicated for kids.  It's basically a simple race around the board.  The strategy and frustration come in because you have opportunities to make other players go back to start, trade places with you, and things like that. What a lot of people don't seem to realize is, there are two sets of rules.  The way most people play, you pick a card up on each turn and do whatever it says.  There is strategy because you have a choice of which piece to move.  In the more advanced play you deal out 5 cards to each player so you have a choice of which card to play as well as which piece to move!  After playing a card you then pick the top card from the stack to replace it so you always have 5 cards.

1091,B07PXSJMHF,RRA9BA8VLX288,"A Solid, Delightful, Lightweight Euro-style Strategy Game (Whether You Enjoy MInecraft or Not)","  I didn‚Äôt pick this game up because I enjoy Minecraft (it‚Äôs a fine game in my eyes, just not my type).I do, however, enjoy collecting and playing boardgames where the theme of the game goes well with its mechanics. This boardgame does this very well and is a very solid design to boot. Players will either get blocks from a community resource cube, run their pawn to the nearest chest on the edges of the board to gather weapons to fight mobs, or build structures onto their mat possibly transforming the terrain in the process to score the most points they can. The player interactivity is light, but there, and meaningful. Grabbing blocks from the cube opens up more blocks for players to grab. Moving your pawn to unexplored areas opens that area up for players to plan and build with cubes that have been allocated. Clearing a layer of blocks from the cube also ends the round (which there are 3) and can potentially be a detriment to other players if their board isn‚Äôt built optimally for them to take advantage of what‚Äôs being scored that round. Turns have consequences. The game is satisfying in its lighthearted theme and is quite a pleasant space to compete in.Recommended.",5.0
1092,B07PXSJMHF,R36JUKOP88DF5T,Overly complicated and tedious for kids who play Minecraft.,"  I hate giving negative reviews and I want to say that, some people might really enjoy this game... We found it really difficult to setup and overcomplicated to play... that's it really. Most of the game parts are made from cardboard... I don't know, just disappointed I guess... Just way, way, way too complicated for it to be fun for kids who actually play Minecraft and who are expecting a board-game version of the game... I'm giving it 2 stars because I'm sure folks worked hard on it... but it's probably going to the charity shop after one game, not sure I even feel comfortable doing that... :-(",2.0
1093,B07PXSJMHF,R21KWCJ8I4IZRJ,"Great game, not as complex as it seems at first!","  The game is overwhelming when you take it out of the box. So many different parts, and you end up covering the table with components. There are lots of different actions and the scoring seems confusing... I was thinking how can this be a game for kids?!BUT then you actually play it, and it all starts to make sense! You begin to see how all the different systems work and integrate with each other. It turns out this is a true eurogame with a bunch of depth.Some reviewers complained that this was too complicated for their kids, but honestly I don't think they tried to play it for long enough. Watch a YouTube video to give you the basics. Once my kids (7+9) learned how the battle system worked, they were HOOKED.The scoring system is very flexible and rewards many playstyles, from a strategic builder to a mob-focused brawler, so different ages of players will all have fun.Highly recommend it!",5.0
1094,B07PXSJMHF,R2FEIK14O4V7ZK,Great intro to euro-style games if you want something other than ticket to ride,"  Purchased this as a Christmas present for our son. If your child loves board gaming, problem solving, and mine craft, he or she should like this.  Each turn you have a choice of the same 5 moves to earn experience points. If your child is quick to pick up patterns, he or she could play. Our 5 year old plays just fine, but also enjoys the ticket to ride series and Queen domino. It feels easiest to teach kids the game when playing just two players.It took 15-20 mins the first play to set up and read all the instructions.  Play time can very as players determine when to end rounds and end the game. We have ranged between 25-45 mins with 2 people.I would recommend this to families looking to give a tactile Minecraft experience to their kids or introduce a more complex, European style game to their family game night.",5.0

I agree with the 10+ age recommendation as some of the mechanics are in depth. My 6 year old plays it but I can tell he struggles at times to stay focused. He loves the game due to it bei g Minecraft but I think he will enjoy it even more in a couple years.I love how you can mine from a resource block, find weapons, explore a world, fight mobs and build structures (via spending resources to buy a card). What a well thought out game! The only adjustment to rules we made was to make the move action (1-2 spaces) ""free"" and making the exploring (flipping over tiles) the ""action"". That way you can use your move to get to weapons, mobs, locations without wasting an action.",5.0
1096,B07PXSJMHF,R3M2D7RNZ0IQ9N,Good bridge between sons videogame hobby and my board game hobby,"  I'll start by saying that my 11 year old is an avid Minecrafter. This was one of his picks for a Christmas gift, and the price and reviews looked decent, so we gave it a try. We've played it half a dozen times or so and have enjoyed it every time. The ONLY reasons it didn't get a full 5 stars are: 1- we found the ""stacking box"" for the square blocks to be a little bit flimsy. It works, but could have been a little bit better design. 2- Shuffling the weapons/tools tiles prior to combating a monster is a little bit clumsy, especially if you've collected quite a few tiles. Including a couple of simple pouches (draw a tile from the pouch instead of off a stack) would have been outstanding.  Other than these two VERY MINOR issues (that are admittedly easy to fix on your own) we've had nothing but enjoyment from this game.",4.0
1097,B07PXSJMHF,RKSLB7G9Y56Z9,Fun game to win against my children,"  I enjoy this strategy game even with only secondhand knowledge of Minecraft. The age 10+ is a good recommendation, though. My advanced 9-year-old is fine and puts up a good strategy but my 6-year-old needs to play it cooperatively with an adult and even then wanders out during scoring. I like planning ahead for the multiple scoring rounds and think it‚Äôs a great mental exercise for older kids.",5.0

Easy to setup, and just enough variety for an adult to enjoy as well.",5.0
1099,B07PXSJMHF,R3EUYPSVNERLDJ,Good game. Very poor components,"  Cheap components. This is especially disheartening coming from  Ravenburger and Mojang Official. The gameplay is actually really well designed. It does a good job of simplifying the video game mechanics into an original idea...The component quality is garbage. Let me start with the box. It's extremely thin, mine came with a fully dented corner and a small hole from shipping. The corners of the top are already splitting from just being opened a few times.The player pieces are very thin cardboard figure markers that you stick in a plastic base. These definitely won't last through much use.The combat in game requires constant shuffling and drawing of tokens. Which isn't a bad mechanic, but the very cheap nature of the material selected has led to some pieces already peeling and being bent. This is also true of the tiles used to make up the overworld.The player mats are very thin card stock.The only bright component feature is the robust wooden cubes.Overall this is a good game. It's cheaply priced and it's fun to play (even for non fans of the game) and has decent strategy.I just don't see this product lasting very long especially with younger kids playing it regularly.",3.0
1100,B07PXSJMHF,R36ZIIKYPBBWN1,Surprisingly great game,"  I should start by disclosing that my family all love Minecraft and that likely played a major role in our enjoyment of this game. But it does a great job of respecting the IP.The game has a fair amount of RNG to it which I am a big fan of because it helps level the playing field and gives my 6 year old daughter a chance when playing against mom and dad. That said there is a lot of strategy and thinking that comes across in the scoring system. There are 3 rounds of scoring and they all depend on having structures on your board. Each structure has a biome, material and type associated to it. Round 1 your score is based on connected biome structures, round 2 material, round 3 type. So as you play you are thinking about how to score as many points in the current round but also thinking ahead to subsequent rounds. For my 6 year old she does not have to have the structures connected to score points as suggested in the rule book.If I had one complaint about the game it is that there is no mechanic for mining iron, diamond, gold, red stone etc. and you gain weapons by picking them up rather than crafting them.This is a great game regardless of the Minecraft IP but if you like Minecraft this is a must have. I sincerely hope the publisher considers releasing an expansion for this game as there is a lot they could do with it.",5.0

I asked if he's diehe wanted iy, seeing that we never get around to playing games in this house. His answer was ""I still want it, just to have."" So, to my little Minecraft, this is a collectable. Collectables are kinda his jam. He's also on the autism spectrum, and collecting is something he began to enjoy since he could sort things at 18 months! Aspie parents knowwhatI'm talking about! :) So this Minecraft game was a hot for his 13th bday. Oh also! Customer service was excellent!

Just not in the ultra competitive, beer fueled way.

We have to actually remove each block at a time on your turn and make sure the tower should not loose the balance.

The box contains cardboard padding that clearly is intended to be discarded. So now what? Put the bricks in the box and watch them shift around. It's like a bag of chips puffed up to look fuller.

1126,B00ABA0ZOA,R13OO1TI5N8SL2,No HDMI Cable Required,"  If somebody doesn't know what Jenga is about: it is a game where you build a tower out of wooden blocks (3 pieces per floor), and players are taking turns to remove blocks out of the tower. If the tower falls apart on your turn, you will lose the game. It is very simple and fun game.If you're looking for a game as described above, then you can't go wrong with this product. Amazon delivered it in timely fashion as usual, and the product is exactly what you would expect‚Äìa bunch of wooden blocks that you can use to build a tower. Also, this comes with game instructions and some kind of stacking aid made out of carton. I tossed the stacking aid to trash, since I find it to be much faster to build the tower by hand without the aid.In my opinion, the game is at its best when played with two people, but there's no limit of how many people can participate in the game. I would recommend using a stable table to play the game on, but a dangling Ikea table (or equivalent) surely adds some challenge.In a good company this game is much more fun than any video game on the market, making it a bargain at less than $10. This game will also work anywhere with decent gravity‚Äìas long as you are able to find a stable surface. In conclusion, I would recommend Jenga to anyone living on a planet that has a sufficient gravitational force to hold the tower together on the surface, which includes all the areas to which Amazon.com delivers.",5.0
1127,B00ABA0ZOA,RNUNA6OTAU68J,"Well-made classic, but I wish it came with a bag","  Purchased this directly from Amazon, and it came new and wrapped in clear plastic.  The inside block stack was also wrapped in plastic, which preserves the blocks until opening.  The blocks are not painted, which allows them to stay together and the game to proceed normally without being shortened by premature slippage. The cardboard box is rectangular, and might serve as a storage mechanism for the blocks for awhile, but I suspect it will not last for that purpose.  I'd prefer a storage bag, like several of the knock-offs that are marketed here have, but a bag might be found elsewhere.",4.0
1128,B00ABA0ZOA,R2750EL5Q69KH1,you really can't beat the amount of fun and suspense that it delivers,"  For the cost of this game, for under 15 dollars, you really can't beat the amount of fun and suspense that it delivers. My fianc√© and all of my friends love this game very much; as well as my parents which tells you that all generations love this game. This is probably one of the best ""board games"" there are around; if you have little kids this would definitely teach hand eye coordination. Definitely durable given the amount of times the tiles have came crashing down going every which way. This game has suspense with no real danger, appeals to all ages, is simple to play, and lasts forever. You can still play it on a coffee table or dining room table, you don't need to clear a place on the floor. One thing I would suggest is changing the box size, you would think that the box would be the exact shape of the game so the pieces aren't rattling around in the box.  All in all; it's a great game for a great price that you can't beat. Definitely a must buy to keep in your home for a rainy day or for a family game night.",5.0

Pieces all appear uniform although I'm pretty sure the quality of the blocks are not as good as the original ones that were made. I'm sure these are lighter.The only other gripe is the very cheap cardboard guide that comes along with the game to assist you in rebuilding the tower once it's been toppled. I'd pay more if there was a better device to assist in building the tower again.Hours of fun that even our 4 year old was able to fully participate in.

1130,B00ABA0ZOA,R3RBD5HZCHP4T6,Love it,"  This toy is extremely durable (how can you really break those small blocks of wood?), it's incredibly flexible as a toy. My family and I plays this game for hours. When my daughter plays it alone, she stays occupied with the game -- playing it alone, stacking and re-stacking the blocks, creating houses and encampments as if the pieces were designed as building blocks.As an adult, I don't enjoy card games or board games much, but I still appreciate having this game around the house. It's a game you can play with just about anyone, and although it does take some concentration when you're the one pulling out that precarious block, you can still converse and cavort while playing (as long as you've got the game on a stable surface!).Jenga also helps teach hand-eye coordination, precision, patience, forethought (""what will happen if I pull out this block?""), and just a bit of physics -- some of the blocks are rougher, some are smoother, so friction comes into play.I highly recommend this game to everyone, regardless of age!",5.0

(We'll assume my memory is still intact.) Just a box full of wood sticks, some of which aren't finished all that well and some not-so-great instructions. It's possible that this game was more of a Midwestern thing because people don't always know what I'm talking about when I mention my wish to build a gigantic version in the backyard.Don't let that be your or your children's loss or your grandchildren's. My brother, sister, and I played this game rather peacefully for at least an hour at a time. My mom would play it with us. Occasionally even my dad, and he hates games. It's a great solo toy, too, for the little ones who like to build. And while you could hide those markers, what will be more fun in 20 years? A perfect vintage Jenga set? Or one that your children ""decorated"" as toddlers? Maybe you should just put some nice markers in your cart while you're at it.I'm all nostalgic about this one, but more than many games and toys of my childhood, I believe this one is still worth playing (which is why I now have my own set). You don't plug it in. It doesn't have any lights, bells, buzzers, or whistles. There's no robot, no artificial intelligence, and not a darn thing anyone can control with their smartphone.

Nope.  The blocks are the size of blocks found in a nice wood building block set. See Melissa & Doug  Solid Wood Building Blocks w/ Wooden Tray (60 Ct) for $59.00.  BIG gripe is the cost of larger Jenga blocks that only stack 3 feet high.  Seventy-five dollars ($75.00) is slightly pretentious, and the pictures are slightly misleading.

My only complaint is that the box is much bigger than the game pieces, it would make storing it and putting it away much easier if the box were the same size, as it is it's nearly impossible to put away neatly. I gave up and put all the pieces in a ziplock bag. Not ideal and it's a pain to store it that way in our game cupboard but since the tower kept falling over and messing up in the box it was the easiest solution.Aside from that it's the classic Jenga we all love!

1136,B00ABA0ZOA,R1MDQPIJLDZ6FN,Great fun for the whole family.,  A fun classic game for the whole family. Except cats.... cats hate Jenga. I've seen a few that like it but they are rare. As soon as the tower falls they run up the wall and out the door. Its not rocket science which is what makes it fun. You remove a block and put it on the top and the next player goes. You can learn a lot about a person and the way they play Jenga. I bet you never knew Nana was such a cut throat. Its a pretty compact game to take on a family trip to not a ton so space.

Because if the wood is made of cheap compressed plywood or something, instead of dense hard wood, it would make a big difference when you try to pull a piece in the stack. The friction between woods will be enough to overcome the weight of the structure on top, thus causing the whole thing collapse more easily.Other than that, overall this is a good product given its price.

Yesterday we finally played this game and I give this five stars for the fun we had and the panic inducing anxiety we got from the sheer fact that we played some risky moves and made the structure unstable,but yet still stable and had not fallen over yet. When my one friend finally knocked it over and released us from our anxious, panic filled, sweat filled mood,we all felt a sense of relief as we started again. The second game was even more anxiety inducing as I pulled a ""risky"" move that one would call miraculous almost and pure genius. This game will keep you away from your phone and off social media. This game will give you and your friends the best memories and quality time well spent. This game will also make those prone to sweating sweat a decent amount. Don't worry you will recover. Thank you Jenga for giving my friends and I a fun filled 2 hours of sheer fun torture. I highly recommend this for you and your family and friends and if you have any enemies, I recommend you play this with them and make it as challenging as possible to not knock the blocks over.",5.0
1139,B00ABA0ZOA,R2Q5N1X0PO3373,"Game, 5star, Packaging 3","  Ok, as far as the game goes, it's Jenga, the blocks are fine quality, 5 stars there.  But as other reviews have stated, the packaging sucks, and I give it 3 stars.  For an overall rating of 4 stars. The problem comes when you want to store the blocks.  You have two trains of thought here.  Save the time of stacking them nicely when you are done, by just throwing them all in the box, and then set them up when you want to play next, OR stack them neatly in the box when you're done, so you don't have to set them up when you want to play next, because you can just slide them out of the box, ready to play.  Either of those options means you only have to stack them nicely once.You can't do EITHER with this packaging.  We tried the first scenario, just throwing them all in the over-sized rectangular box, thinking that must be why it's bigger, so it can accommodate all of the blocks when they're not stacked up nicely.  NOPE.  They won't fit if you just throw them all in.  Ok, not a problem, we'll just stack them neatly in the cardboard corner guide they give you and put them in.  While that will allow you to fit all the blocks in the box, there is nothing inside to hold them together, so they all fall apart anyway as soon as you move the box to a shelf and you have to set them up again when you want to play again!  So when you put them away, you have to stack them nicely, and then when you want to play, you have to stack them AGAIN before playing.  I mean you could solve this by either 1. Make the box square, so the blocks don't come apart in the box, or 2. Make the box big enough to accommodate all the blocks when they are just thrown in randomly.  There could be a 3rd option, which would be to just get a big gallon size ziplock bag, they might all fit in there.  However, then you have no place to store the cardboard sleeve which acts as a guide when setting them up.  You just can't win. Packaging fail.TL;DR The game is fine, but putting them away and setting them up sucks purely because of the packaging.Rant over.",4.0
1140,B00ABA0ZOA,R1AU12VLT5TKQI,jenga game,"  This is a classic game that I loved as a kid and bought for my daughter for Christmas.  I want to make others aware, since there was no warning on the description (sometmes there is, but for this item there was not) there was no outer box, the toy was just shipped so that you see what it is.  I would recommend checked the ""this is a gift"" option if you need to keep the contents hidden. My daughter was right there when I brought it in. I think I managed to keep it out of her sight.  :-(.  however, it makes for an awkward Santa gift when there i an Amazon label attached. lol.

If you want to work on their fine motor skills, the action of trying to push out a brick is very helpful and builds their concentration skills too. For adults it‚Äôs just a fun game. If you‚Äôve never played it before, it‚Äôs super-fun. You build the tower up in a certain formation and then take turns trying to remove one block at a time without destroying the tower. It‚Äôs amazing how you can take one block out that seems like it would make the tower collapse but it stays!",5.0
1142,B00ABA0ZOA,R3148W65QX8GXA,"Great game, poor packaging","  So we love Jenga in our house and wanted a new set after we lost some of the other pieces. Oddly, however, this comes in a box that is not the same size as the game so you can't easily store it stacked up in the box. And the thing that is supposed to be used to keep it in shape in between games and to set it up right is no longer hard plastic but cheap cardboard, so it is not going to last very long (with a house full of kids) so there won't be an easy way to re-set the game up without the thing that keeps it i the right shape. Our old Jenga game had a nice plastic thing to keep the shape of the game and then a box that was the size of the game so it could be easily stored in the box in between games. For a game with a million pieces, it makes no sense to not think about how people will store it and set it up. I'm sure it is a cost-saving thing and marketing thing, but if you can buy one with a smaller box so you can easily store it and keep its shape in between games. Of course the game is great as always.",4.0
1143,B00ABA0ZOA,R2C6PDKDI95OUD,Authentic Jenga Game to Play or Create a Lasting Memory,"  We ordered this Jenga game to add more to our family Board Game Night. The game is authentic (having previously purchased this for my classroom). It's a super fun game and we had a ton of fun with it.  I also recently attended a wedding and they had a Jenga game with Sharpies and asked every attendee to write a message to the couple so that when things seem like they're falling apart, they can read the messages together while they play Jenga as a reminder that sometimes things in a marriage aren't always perfect, but together they can rebuild it back to perfection.  So cute!",5.0
1144,B00ABA0ZOA,R173ZHLJPXWAJT,Wood Blocks are Good--But NO Stacking Assistance,"  My son asked for Jenga for Christmas, and he's pleased with his new game. I think the wood blocks themselves are quality with smooth, flat surfaces and square edges. However, I expected to be able to stack the tower back into the box when the game is not in use. The description says it includes a stacking sleeve--which I didn't see the kids open the game so I don't know exactly what was in the rectangular retail package but packaging/stacking sleeve is lacking in my opinion. There is nothing to help keep the tower square as you stack the blocks into shape. And then you either dump them back into the rectangle-shaped retail package and risk them not all fitting as they pile up haphazardly, or you take the time to stack them knowing the stack won't survive into the correct shape next time you take the blocks out of the package to play. So, I guess that lends itself to the cheaper price.",3.0
1145,B00ABA0ZOA,R2AW9F4ETCDWMS,Super fun Amazing Quality,"  Update : I have bought 2 more sets of Jenga since the original review. During this lockdown, other than spending time in playing the traditional game, my child also loves using the Jenga blocks to construct endless structures big and small for her dolls. She loves themMore than her Legos. I reiterate that the blocks are beautifully made ( I learnt from India) and lightweight and never had any splinters or sharp edges till date. It‚Äôs just a solidly entertaining game which can be used in multiple ways. One of my best purchased toys on Amazon.I bought this as a gift for my 9 year old nephew who is a blocks enthusiast. I got it for just under 8$ and didn‚Äôt expect the quality to be so good. The blocks are well made from wood and have no chips or splinters at the edges. They make for loads of fun for adults or kids and helps in concentration and strategy. My nephew was more than pleased and I liked the set so much I bought one for myself and play with my 4 year old who‚Äôs loving it too. So worth the price and highly recommendable.",5.0
1146,B00ABA0ZOA,R2K67AW0N76ALP,Always loved Jenga,  I love this game. We've gotten pretty good and most of our games end in stalemates where there are no available moves. We can keep playing by allowing two hands and attempting to restructure the tower so we can pull more blocks. We actually ended up just buying a second game and making the initial tower taller.I will agree with others that the boxes are stupid as all he--. I don't know why its a rectangle so the blocks don't fit without a struggle to center it. The cardboard cutouts used to fill in the spaces are flimsy and move around.

One thing I will say - I seem to remember years ago, when Jenga first came out, they gave you a nice plastic thingy that you could use to square up and straighten the stack of blocks.  Now, it's just a cheap piece of thin cardboard.  Not a big deal - you really don't even need it - but it is a change from before.  Anyway, it's still a fun game.",4.0

I looked it up and saw that the ice cream came along in 2004; that's pretty late to be ""classic."" I wish it was exactly like the one I had as a kid. I wonder why companies keep making ""classic"" and ""retro"" editions of games and toys but including changes that make the game or toy not the way it was. It's still better than playing on one of the new boards, but the fake parts in the classic/retro games are sad reminders that we may never again play the same games we played as kids.Dear Milton Bradley,Please stop with the ridiculous Star Wars and Frozen and every-Disney-movie versions of all of our old games.

1152,B00000DMFM,R3Q1NLTUVREIA6,"Kids, this is NOT your parents' Operation Game...","  I was soooo excited to gift this game to our 5yr old daughter. It was my favorite game when I was a kid. So, when I saw the classic edition, it was a no-brainier. Although the appeal of the game has stood the test of time, the quality of this game is less than acceptable. The small white playing pieces are made so much more cheaply than the original game. Many of the pieces cannot be played the same way we did as kids. For example, as a kid I would remove the butterfly by pinching the raised worm-body - that piece of plastic is no longer thick enough to grasp. The same can be said for the spare ribs and the water bucket. What is odd is that the ""new piece"" of an ice cream cone representing brain freeze is visibly thicker than the old pieces and can be played by grasping the details on the cone rather than the edges. Most upsetting is that the sides of the all the pieces are slightly beveled, making it REALLY hard to grasp with the tweezers when they are face up. In fact, the charlie horse is so beveled that it is UNPLAYABLE! I'm taping over it in so no one will even try to remove it because it is IMPOSSIBLE to remove and only play with this piece only ends in tears. There is obviously a problem with the way the white playing pieces are being manufactured - a result of corporate greed, no doubt. I am very displeased with this new version of the game and will seek out a vintage version at thrift shops and antique stores to replace this major disappointment. I gave the game 3 stars because it is still a super cool game, but if I could, I would only give it 1 star for quality of play. I give the original game 5 stars.",3.0

He was able to clean out all of the bones and body parts without a single buzzer.  I remembered that when I was a kid, it was nearly impossible to get the parts out of the body without setting off the buzzer.  I was also a little annoyed that instead of realish body parts, the game was full of cell phones and head phones and other silly things.Then I discovered that the game had been changed and made much much easier.  Thus started my hunt for the original operation, which THIS is (although there is an added piece in the brain that was apparently added in the late 2000s.

For someone who has played probably a hundred games with the old numbering, it's near impossible to adjust.The other ""improvement"" is a folding barrier they now include which you can put up in the center of the board to hide your pieces as you are placing them. But guess what. If you are playing with a kid, inevitably they will knock this over and send your pieces flying just after you've spent 10 minutes organizing them.I would very much like to meet the person responsible for these changes so I could give them a piece of my mind. Maybe even challenge them to a game of Stratego--the REAL original version.",2.0
1182,B07QXMJH7L,RA5NGP5F51E05,The numbers are backwards and not like the original old-school versions we used to play as a kid,  I love the quality and look of the whole product. I got this version just so I can put my older version away and keep it and somewhat good condition. But the deal-breaker is the numbers are backwards and it's next to impossible to convert. Come to find out are older versions we're not accurate like the one I got today but I've been playing the other version for so long that I have to use my old version and I can't even use this version,3.0
1183,B07QXMJH7L,R1WOXVDCQ5W6KN,Perfect! Better than expected.,"  I'm worried to buy a product that has no reviews, but I've taken the risk since I did not want to buy any of the other versions with stickers that have many problems according to the reviews. The quality of the package, the board, the pieces and every single component in the game is superior. I loved it.",5.0
1184,B07QXMJH7L,R336JAJY4JV5DI,Upgraded 80s version - no stickers; better bits,  Heavy plastic pieces with the numbers printed on.  No stickers. Nice round castle (rook) shaped pieces that don't knock over easily.  Comes with covered & numbered holders for each player's pieces and a really nice heavy privacy screen for set up.  Reminiscent of the 80s version but with definite improvements.Gameplay - 2 players; set up your board to defend your flag while allowing for pieces to go capture your enemy's flag.  Different numbered pieces allow for different movement & abilities but basically higher numbers defeat lower (in this version).  Take turns moving and attacking.  Win by Capturing the enemy's flag first.,5.0
1185,B07QXMJH7L,R1OPM27L1KMF6U,Excellent game,"  No stickers! Numbered reverse from when I was younger (10 is best piece, 1 is spy) but all together it‚Äôs a great game, excellent replay.",5.0
1186,B07QXMJH7L,R19A5YFOMT703J,Not the Original. Completely Backwards,"  There is no ‚ÄúS‚Äù spy. There‚Äôs a # 10. The Original set only went up to 9.Pieces are in reverse order. Higher # captures lower #. 9 captures 8. Miners are not # 8. So there are the‚Äùwrong‚Äù number of pieces assigned to each number.Will I be able to adjust to this change. Yes. Is it the Original. No.Misleading.It‚Äôs like turning houses into hotels, Free Parking into jail and Go to Start.Don‚Äôt mess with success. This is not an improvement.Maybe stickers would‚Äôve been better if they were done right.* Played for 1st time. What a mess! Set up board completely wrong. New numbering system is awful. It‚Äôs like taking a deck of cards and rearranging the order randomly.Wish bought stickers.",3.0
1187,B07QXMJH7L,R3IZ5Z9TFRCZ1W,Classic game as good as remembered,"  As one of the games of my childhood, I wanted to bring the joy of this game to my children.My first impressions were great.  The box has a great vinyl like feel that is sure to be more rugged than most of our household games.  Many of our games have cracked or broken edges based on stacking them or just the nature of young kids.  So this was a huge plus immediately.The red and blue pieces have their own carrying case.  Just a small plastic tray with a top, but it means that the game goes back together the same way each time.  And this will prevent the playing pieces from going missing.  Another plus in my mind.The board itself is rather rugged.  There was a small tear initially upon first opening, but that was in the seam of the board and not on the playing surface.  The board is heavy and feels like it will last.The divider was my first negative mark.  3 or 4 times in the first few play throughs, the board has fallen down and knocked over our pieces.  I say set this aside and avoid the potential upset.Finally, the game itself is fun.  This is more strategy then luck.  Very simple concept, but the customization of arranging your pieces is a nice change from many other board games out there.  And the time spend creating the game play is just enough to not get boring.Overall, if you played this as a kid, or this is your first time, I would highly recommend it!",4.0
1188,B07QXMJH7L,R1L4DK8C35MDZQ,Pieces have no color - numbers hard to read (too small) and they fall over and roll easily,"  I finally got used to the new pieces being numbered backwards. The white color on the pieces make it hard to easily and quickly tell what your pieces are. Number 6 for my eyes is hard to differentiate from the 8. Pieces fall over easily and roll - knocking out other pieces like a bowling ball. I was going to return but my son adores the game - he is 7 and is really good - wow. Might pick up another version down the line - miss the other pieces stickers or not. If my son attempts to use another classic board - good luck everything will be backwards. Amazon reviews used to carry heavy weight in my purchasing decisions, they continue going down the drain for reliability and sellers padding /  bios. 2 stars. Try to find a different version if you played this game in the 70's or 80s.",2.0
1189,B07QXMJH7L,R255OAUPUT4C20,Finally A Stratego set without the cheep stickers.,"  I'm so happy they decided to make the pieces look less like a corny cheep wannabe board game. I grew up playing a much nicer version of the stratego game and lost the game due to moving around a lot. Wanted to buy the game again but all the other versions looked so cheesy and cheep. This visual and quality rework of the Original Statego game does it so much justice. It is perfect, even the box feels nice :) A very high quality and well presented game. This is the best looking out of all the versions. Good job play monster.",5.0
1190,B07QXMJH7L,R3RU5QGG54QJ8V,Old School Game,"  My husband had this as a kid.  I have never heard of this game!  The hubs thought it would be fun for he and our son to play.  Our son is 11 YO.  And it is!  I like it too.  It is a bit tricky on the first time, but once you have played it a few times, it is super fun.  It is a great raining day game, when 2 people have nothing to do and the 3rd one has a book to read or cooking to do!  Would be a great gift.  I would say you need to be about 9 or 10 to play this.",5.0
1191,B07QXMJH7L,RXWT5ANPFNBPM,All about the strategy,  I had never heard of this game until my son in middle school joined a board game club. He is now obsessed and has daily battles with his classmates. Great classic strategic game!!,5.0

Set up your pieces and then work your way to the other side to capture your opponents flag, but watchoit for your opponents bombs and higher ranking pieces.I have been wanting to purchase this game for years but knew the sticker version was terrible and the stickers peeled. Newer version has gone back to engraving the plastic with the piece information.",5.0
1193,B07QXMJH7L,R1CBV7RJNDJH9O,Not as cheaply made as some old favorites,"  I've purchased several ""old favorite"" games recently, and was always disappointed with the flimsy cheap products I recieved.  This was much better.  The board was thicker and the pieces more significant.  Only time will tell if the inscriptions on the game will hold up.We have an 8 year old that we want to play more games with, and this is one that was super easy for him to learn and fun for everyone.  Best of all, it's the type of game where he will gain tactical skills over time and become more of a challenge.... currently I have to ""throw"" a number of games in order for he and I to have a fairly equal number of ""wins"".  In a couple of years, he may have to be the one to ""throw"" a game or two",5.0
1194,B07QXMJH7L,R3FII5N5C6VIZ2,It's NOT the original.,"  I remembered playing Stratego as a kid.  This game has the numbers backwards from how I remember it.  Does it affect the game?  No, just annoying.",3.0
1195,B07QXMJH7L,R2O9O9BFWFMC50,Excellent strategy game with excellent customer service,"  My wife always talked about playing Stratego as a kid so I bought this for her birthday present. We played a few games and had a blast. When friends come over, we turn it into a 2v2 and it gets pretty wild when partners try to figure out if we should wait, attack, decide where to move and what we think a piece may be. It leads to fighting but it's all in good fun.There was a small but major problem with 2 of the pieces. One of the blue piece had a scratch on it and the number 10 was a slightly darker shade of red. The red is unnoticeable unless you look really hard, in which you can immediately identify which piece is the 10. I reached out to customer service and showed them a picture. I added a filter to show how the reds differ. Within a few days, they sent two replacement pieces.",5.0

1197,B07QXMJH7L,R34PIIJ7X6LWUC,Great game set!,"  I picked this up after hearing people talk about it. I never played it before. I really enjoy the game and so does my family. Like the name suggests, it is based on strategy. My 7 year old is able to play though. He may not understand the underlying strategy but you can see his mind working every time he plays. I like that the instructions give alternate ways to play with less pieces.The pieces are sturdy and everything fits easily in the box after use. The only negative is the middle board for blocking sight when setting up pieces is difficult to keep standing.",5.0

1199,B07QXMJH7L,R2IX0HXVU4FMDF,My history buff loves it,"  I‚Äôd never played but purchased for the quarantine. It took me about 10 minutes to learn to play- it‚Äôs like a more complicated version of Battleship. But more complicated is definitely more fun. One of the better strategy games to play with slightly older kids, and because you can reconfigure it has a lot of replay value.It was well packaged and all the pieces have little numbered slots for easy cleanup and setup.",5.0
1200,B07QXMJH7L,R2TAWU4OSTYZXL,"""Try to win dad""","  This game is great! I remember playing this with my siblings as a kid so I thought I'd buy it to see how my kids liked it. Not only the kids, but the wife have been trying to figure out a strategy to beat me since we got it. It's a nightly routine of ""Try to win dad"". Definitely worth the money. Although the numbers on each piece are a little small so my old eyes have to look close to make sure I'm playing right.",4.0
1201,B07QXMJH7L,RCKURVEW2JNYT,"Fun game, pieces are a bit small and cheap.","  I played this game growing up and the pieces are much different. This is advertised as ""classic pawns with no stickers!"" though I'm not sure the benefit of not having stickers on the pieces. They are quite small and cheaply made. The board and box seem very well made. It's unfortunate they cut corners on the game pieces. Still 4 stars.",4.0
1202,B07QXMJH7L,R3PXRYCU869OVK,Game pieces have tiny numbers that are illegible.  Choose a different version.,"  As a lover of the original Stratego, it was extremely frustrating to open this version and find out that the new pieces are inferior to the original in several respects.  1) the numbers are so tiny that it is impossible to see - especially the white on red.  The printing is very faint as well  2) The cheap round plastic rook like pieces are slippery and fall over easily during gameplay or get turned slightly so that they are exposed to the other player.I have no idea why this company ruined a perfectly good game piece to save just a few bucks.  What a shame.  This set is not worth owning.  Just to make it playable, I had had to print out numbers and then tape them on the pieces with clear tape.  What a huge pain!",1.0

1207,B07QXMJH7L,R134CRQ39PUMO9,Love it,"  Just like the original, loved it. The rankings are reversed now (lower number used to trump higher numbers) but it's not a big deal.

I understand the need to stay in line with the original in this version, but it is a drawback.  Also, the board which folds into a quarter of its size, tears along the fold-lines over time. I still gave 5 starts, but it is on the bottom end of the 5th star because of these issues.",5.0

1265,B00D8STBHY,R1ZZXV5R1VSY6Y,Still the Same Awesome Game!,"  We absolutely love this game! The sad part is that the world has become accustomed to cheaply made products. Unfortunately, this is just a price we have to pay if we want affordable products. Hasbro has done a wonderful job ensuring that Connect 4 continues to be a part of our lives, but if you're looking for the sturdy game you had when you were a kid, this one falls a little short. The rack is flimsy and made of thin plastic, and the discs lack that heavy checker weight, BUT they totally work. Just mentioning it for the people who are nostalgic, this game just feels a little different. Our kids don't know the difference and it certainly doesn't matter when you measure the memories that were making with them, but it is nice to remember some of the differences from when we were kids.",4.0
1266,B00D8STBHY,R8DJLS6USGOY6,~ Continuing the Connect 4 Tradition with the Grandchildren ~,"  Hasbro Connect 4 Game was one of our daughter's absolute favorite games to play, growing up. In fact, she and her dad played a game of it almost every night as part of her bedtime routine. Our daughter now has kids of her own and it is time to continue the tradition of playing this game. We ordered it at Christmastime and have been looking forward to playing it with the grandchildren. It got set aside, but has now been noticed again by our grandson and he is very excited to play it. Got it out and put it together, ready for his next visit. Looks about the same as it did back then. There is some fun to be had here. Looking forward to many years of making new and fabulous memories of Connect 4 with the grandchildren.",5.0
1267,B00D8STBHY,RMRUBCRECB1A3,There's A Good Reason It's A Classic,"  Anyone can play it. It's ready to go out of the box. You can play for minutes or an hour. Losing a disc somewhere under the couch isn't the end of the world. Kids different ages can still play with each other. This is an essential go to the toy closet sort  of item. I was afraid a new one like this might be cheaper feeling or flimsier than the older ones, but was pleased to see that while it won't survive really rough handling the toy is durable enough for normal little kid play.",5.0
1268,B00D8STBHY,R2OMKXDCMWHY6C,Wish I would have kept my childhood board games,"  Cheaper quality and you have to pop out the plastic pieces (legs and slider). On the positive side they popped out cleanly with no sharp marks. My kids are almost three and five so we use this with some supervision to mainly work on fine motor skills. My nonverbal three year old really enjoys seeing all of the pieces fall into place and has played with this non stop for three days now. We use it to count out loud our pieces dropped in, make color patterns and of course color recognition. It‚Äôs a little lighter and smaller than I remember and the kids knock it over sometimes but it‚Äôs sufficient and we got it for turkey day sales so it was worth the cost. Even though hasbro cheaper out it‚Äôs still a solid game and the kids really like it.",5.0
1269,B00D8STBHY,RLCHQGJ5MTR6Q,Great learning tool for toddlers.,"  I really loved Connect 4 when I was a kid. Then I bought this for my 3 year old and 1 year old. Although they are not playing by the rules, putting the discs into the slot keeps them busy. It's also a good tool to teach colors and counting as well as learn about taking turns. A+ plus in my book.",5.0

Of course, she beat the pants off of me but had a great time doing it. Grandparents beware - your little grandchildren love playing games and they are good at it. My 7-yr-old granddaughter can play me like a fiddle and beat my butt on Connect 4. Finally after beating me time after time, she admitted that one of her pre-school teachers had taught her game strategy on winning in this game and she took pity and tried to teach me some of her tricks. :) Gotta love the little children.",5.0
1271,B00D8STBHY,R1HYR7GK4EDMGD,A Fun Classic Game,"  I bought this to relive my childhood memories back in elementary school, but also to teach my nephews how to play Connect 4. It's so fun and easy to learn. I am a cynical uncle by making my nephews eat the Beanboozle Jellybeans if they lose (which is 98% of the time). Other than that, very quick, easy, entertaining, and builds strategies for young children where their brains are still developing via the Connect 4 game (probably not the jellybeans part).",5.0

The goal is the same--to get four colors in a row. At first my children struggles with predicting where a player might go next, but after playing with it for a while, they've really started to get the knack for it. It has helped them to develop critical thinking skills. We got the game at Christmas, and it's now eight months later and they still pull it out to play all the time. I think this one will be a keeper.",5.0
1273,B00D8STBHY,R3J199XNUH8CDM,My fave childhood game!,"  I bought this game for my two boys (9 and 6) to play together because i remembered having it and loving it as a child and knew that they would enjoy it also. I was right. They played non stop, switching sides constantly hah. Game is sturdy enough to withstand my boys and thats saying something. I wouldn't travel with the one of the original size because it would be tricky, with all the counters etc but you could make it work using the box as a level ground to play on. I would go ahead and just purchase the miniature version though if needed for the car. There are so many wonderful ways to use Connect Four as a game, especially if homeschooling. For instance, I used little round price stickers and wrote letters on them to teach my youngest his letters. The players would then say the letter names and sounds as they put them in the slot. Then, with my oldest, I wrote sight words. You could do numbers, suffixes, nouns etc. Love that this game is also one I actually want to play. I dont run and hide when my kids suggest playing a board game anymore. It's quick, fun and easy to put away when done. Gets them thinking of strategy and, as stated above, many other things depending on how you use it. All round great game.",5.0
1274,B00D8STBHY,R240LEZXYDNWJW,Classic,"  The classic game, just like I remember from my childhood. (Or is it? I remember the pieces being red and black, not red and yellow, but maybe I'm confused...)Introducing it to my daughter, she's loving it.For classic gameplay, this does the trick.  However, this original design only allows classic gameplay, due to an all-or-nothing mechanism to remove pieces from the bottom.  Apparently other versions of this game exist that allow you to remove pieces one at a time, which allows additional variations of gameplay.  Check out the Wikipedia article on this game for descriptions of those variations, if interested.So, 5 stars for the classic game, minus one star for the lack of the more advanced one-at-a-time removal mechanism.",4.0
1275,B00D8STBHY,RRLXVQURXTB3N,New update to an old school game.,"  I had taught my son when he was 5 how to play Connect 4, only it was on an old school version. The legs slid off and snapped together to create a holder that would balance (if you were lucky). We decided to take that one to grandma's house and get a newer one. He likes the red and the yellow chips and I love the foldability of it. When I was a kid (too long ago), my brother and I had a travel Connect 4 that had this sliding tray capability and we loved it. I was excited to see this on a larger scale AND knowing that the box lid will actually sit flat (the other one never did). Plus, you can't beat this price to encourage critical thinking skills and hours of endless fun!",5.0
1276,B00D8STBHY,R3FFFDMYL7ZM0A,Everyone thinks they're good at this game until they lose to a 6 year-old,"  Given the virus and need to social distance, I bought a bunch of board games to play with the family at home.I remembered this game from my youth.  I remember being super competitive and playing this with my brother and friends for hours. For some reason I remember being really good.I remembered wrong.First my 14 year old son proceeded to spank me 5 times in a row before declaring playing with me was too easy and that I should try playing with my 6 year old nephew first for practice.  I hit my tongue while chewing on some humble lie and pretended to laugh as my little nephew climbed into my son's lap across from me and then proceeded to win 4 out of 5 games with no coaching from my son.Since I managed to win the last game, I decided to retire on a winning note.I have now hidden the game and am now secretly playing online until I can play well enough to kick both their butts.II'll let you know how that goes.",5.0
1277,B00D8STBHY,R1FQWFZJNS1WA8,Incredibly poorly made,"  This game came with legs and a bottom slider that need to be twisted out of a plastic frame.  The pieces didn't fit together well, and the bottom piece fell off immediately when my kids tried to use it.  When they tried to snap it back on, the pieces broke off.  Really, really junkie.  I do not recommend which is too bad, because the game concept is nice.",1.0
1278,B00D8STBHY,R2U4FXUC4Q6YH,Was Capt'n Cook obsessed with this game?,"  It is stated that Capt'n Cook was so obsessed with this game that it became known as the Captain's Mistress.  No real evidence to support that but nevertheless a blast to play.There are strategies that can be applied for the player starting the game as well as the one playing second.  There is a mathematical solution to the game but what fun is that?  Kids will probably love it, too because even if their skill level needs some catching up, you can still fill the slots with them and let them push the lever at the bottom to let all the discs fall in a clatter onto the table when the game is over.  Hours of fun!There are multi skill level free online versions that can get you ready for the real thing.  If you find yourself always in a pickle, they can help you become a better player.  What I like about the game overall is that it is likely better for your brain than simply sitting in front of a screen with a controller---and more interactive and fun than Sudoko!",5.0

Some games can take hours to play from start to finish but this one is  easy to set up and play and can be really quick.The idea is to connect 4 of your color pieces in a row (straight or diagnal) while strategically also blocking your partner from doing the same first.  First to successfully connect 4 of their game pieces wins.  It's a bit like tic-tac-toe.The entire game can be as short as 1 minute to maxing out around 5-10 minutes (unless your child takes really long turns...like sings eeny-meeny-miny-mo followed by the ""bubble gum, bubble gum in a dish"" chant every turn)It's short enough that I can play a few rounds and then let the kids verse each other while I finish up cleaning or whatever.We have now owned this game for one whole year and it's not broken, the pieces are not lost and we still play it which is FAR more than I can say for Monopoly <---That game never ends!!!

The game pieces and frame are plastic, the legs are detachable for storage back in the box, hopefully they are sturdy enough to withstand play from both the 5 yr old and 2 yr old.

Only happens in one channel of the game board, I've looked closely at it, doesn't seem to have any burrs on the plastic, perhaps it was just molded bad.I remember playing this game decades ago, but I don't recall the game board being this flimsy.

It ends up taking about a week to complete the game, but its loads of fun as we talk crap about who gonna win  all week via text messages, etc.  I might make a move before I go to bed; he works a different shift....then when I get up in the morning he's made a move and left a note with some smart quip or wise crack.

1285,B00D8STBHY,R34K17SY1FNA6M,Buy a different set if possible!,"  When assembled, the game won't fit in its box. This makes no sense, since it's clearly a game primarily aimed at young children--if both players play perfectly, as in Tick-Tac-Toe, it's always a draw. My 8 year-old never loses! Game also says adult assembly required. So the game maker expects a parent to put it together and take it apart every time, which is ridiculous since if they'd spent a few extra cents on a larger box, the problem would not exist. Called their customer service number and asked for a suitable box, but not only was turned down but the lady acted as though expecting the game to fit in its storage box was silly!",2.0

She used to bring her set every single time she visited us. So easy to pack it in her suitcase (the maker should consider selling a deluxe version in its own carrying case). It‚Äôs one of our kids‚Äô best memory of Grandma.It‚Äôs inexpensive, especially when you consider the educational benefits from a game that‚Äôs not only engaging and usable by a wide range of ages, but will teach logic and thinking skills.

She regularly kicks my ass. Seriously, I don't let her win in any way, but she takes about 70% of the games from me. From a product point of view, it's an inexpensive plastic frame with some plastic chips. There's not much to it. If you treat it badly, it could break... so be careful with it.

1294,B00D8STBHY,R1PBXF005V4ITB,I've Modified the Game for My Four-Year-Old,"  ¬†There are 3 PROS to the Hasbro Connect 4 Game:1. Though it‚Äôs made of plastic, it is hard plastic and seems quite durable.2. You can modify the rules to even the playing field between parents and kids.3. The pieces are bright and easy to find (we don‚Äôt believe in storing things in boxes.)The 3 CONS are:1. My preschooler is terrible at playing the standard game.2. It‚Äôs too easy for him to just ‚Äúflip the board‚Äù so to speak (by shifting the bottom lever and causing the pieces to fall.)3. I have to stay on top of my Connect 4 skills so he will never be able to beat me.My four-year-old son got a $25 Amazon gift card from one of his many grandmas so we took him on a cyber shopping spree. Connect 4 was one of his picks. I had to do a little assembly once it arrived, but it only took a couple minutes. I then tried to explain to him how to play, but he didn‚Äôt really care for the rules, especially since I always go hard in the paint (and I expect him to do the same if he wants to get ahead in Trump‚Äôs America.)Well, his constantly losing and acting out took its toll. I assure you I offered him encouraging words along the way and pointed out where he should stop me. But alas, the fun just wasn‚Äôt there. So, like the government handing out our hard-earned dollars to multinational corporations, I modified the game so he would get to play twice for every single turn I took. This evened the playing field a bit.When my fingers are sore from hours of connecting, I tap out and Bucky has fun just making patterns with the pieces and board.Overall, I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs gotten his $8 of entertainment out of it in the last couple months. I give it five stars.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. I‚Äôm here to help!",5.0

1296,B08635WFFM,R3GDTLX03WQ958,Best game in my collection,"  I have at least 30 games but this is the best game I own. Played it about a dozen times in the month since I‚Äôve had it. Take a route building strategy game (like Ticket to Ride) and marry it with the capitalist cutthroat aspect of Monopoly. Then make it cool and retro for aviation lovers. Each game I‚Äôve played has been very different and I haven‚Äôt found one lone strategy that gives you the winning edge each time. I‚Äôve tried different approaches and have had fun experimenting. It‚Äôs fun with two players also but less cutthroat since you don‚Äôt have to compete for the same routes and relying more on luck. The cards and pieces are beautifully designed, but it does take a while to set up the game before you can play. Your very first game will take a while to learn but by your third game you‚Äôll be comfortable with the game. It‚Äôs not made for hardcore gamers but it is harder than your average game. The instructions are very clear and organized but watch some videos before you jump in.Negatives: Many of the pieces are very small so you don‚Äôt want to open it with young kids around. Be very organized with setup and breakdown of the game so you don‚Äôt lose anything. One of my jet planes had a broken wing when I took it out of the box for the first time. One small gripe is the use of tiny cardboard coins instead of bills for currency. The coins are harder to handle and take up more space when trying to put pieces away. I had to break sections of the cardboard insert to fit everything back in the box.Those very minor nuisances aside, this is a game you'll think about all day and look forward to playing.",5.0
1297,B08635WFFM,R2N57R59506LVN,Great game that everyone should try!,"  We have a pretty large collection of board and card games. As one reviewer said perfectly, this is a blend of monopoly and ticket to ride in a really thematic and effective way. We just finished our first game and really enjoyed it and are excited to play it again. Even though it took about two hours total to both play and learn, things clicked once we were a few turns in and we are looking forward to learning and employing the strategies we learned in the first game.Materials were all perfect. Cards, board, figures, everything played to the retro theme and were high quality.This game is, without a doubt, going to find its way to our table quite a bit. Perfect for those looking to get deeper into board gaming but not a deep dive. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs medium weight, and that there is very minimal luck involved. This game will go for you how you choose which I like. There is more conflict than in Ticket to Ride but less than Agricola. Just depends on your group. My wife and I felt 2 player was awesome and can‚Äôt imagine 4, but that‚Äôs our taste.I highly recommend this game, give it a try!",5.0
1298,B000809OAO,R2GKO6ZJ2ZZTW,I do like TTR USA more,"  UPDATE: I have now switched my review from 1 star to 5 stars. After contacting several representatives, we were finally referred to the counterfeit team. They have now opened a ticket and refunded our money! Thank you, Amazon!As for the game, itself, I do like TTR USA more. Europe adds a different level of play. It was a little odd with the ferries and tunnels. You have to have multiple locomotives in your hand, just in case. I felt like we spent more time accumulating cards that we may or may not need instead of actually playing. It was nice to play on a different map.We had purchased this game and was not able to open it during to life circumstances until almost a year later. We received a counterfeit version with 5 train stations, missing red trains, and bubbly paper on the board that wasn't glued properly. I didn't think it was a counterfeit because the cards, box, and game board all had that linen-look finish, but it was!We knew we were way past the 30 day return window, but Amazon has been good to us in the past and we read on some board game forums how Amazon exchanged their game past the return window, so we gave it a try.The Amazon associate we talked to, while kind, was wholly unhelpful. He just kept repeating, ""I am not authorized to approve."" over and over. I'm hugely disappointed in how Amazon has handled this. Like I said, we were past the return window (our fault), but Amazon has knowledge of these counterfeit games. I'm more upset in the fact that these counterfeit games are completely unregulated. My family has played one game with it before we realized it was an incomplete game so I have no idea what substances my family was handling (lead? asbestos?).Amazon did not care.Our associate kindly offered us to buy another game.We regularly buy games from Amazon and will no longer do so.",5.0
1299,B000809OAO,R2N40WJP94A77P,My Favorite Version of Ticket to Ride,"  Fantastic game and my favorite version of Ticket to Ride. Below I list out the features that I think make this version more interesting, or at least different, than other versions.But first! I do have to report that the first game box that was shipped to us was damaged (no damage on the box it was shipped in). I didn't bother opening it to see if there were missing game pieces, I just ordered an exchange. The new game arrived two days later - no damage and no missing pieces. Reading the reviews, a lot of people have this issue. This shouldn't be happening! But at least the exchange process was easy.Interesting game play features:1) Train stations - Train stations allow you to use a single claimed route of one your opponents to connect two cities. If the city in which you place the train station has multiple claimed routes originating from it, you need to specify which connection you are using. Knowing that you won't completely ruin your planned path when someone claims a route you wanted adds a bit of relief; however, you still have to use train stations sparingly. You only get 3, and for any unused stations, you get 4 extra points at the end of the game.2) Tunnels and Ferries - This map has both tunnels and ferries. This adds many complications to your strategy while claiming routes. The most obvious being that for ferry routes you'll need locomotives (wild cards) and for tunnels you may want to have a few extra cards of the color route your claiming, or perhaps some extra locomotives. On maps that only have ferries or tunnels, the people I play with tend to be less motivated to pick up wilds, especially with Ticket to Ride: US, which is tunnels only.3) Only 3 Long Routes - The map has two routes that are 6 train cars in length (15 points) and one that is 8 train cars (21 points) and all three are either a tunnel or ferry route. The US version had multiple routes along the top that are 5 or 6 train cars long. Claiming those routes, coupled with the destination tickets connecting the east and west coasts can allow you to rack up a serious amount of points and take a commanding lead over your opponents. With a fewer number of high point routes, and the fact that these routes are harder to claim, you may find yourself changing your strategy a bit.4) Only One High Point Destination Ticket per Person - Each player only gets one high point destination ticket (blue background) at the start of the game and the rest are placed back in the box. You can choose to discard it before game play starts, but you won't get a chance to pick up another.4) Regular-Sized Cards - This may sound silly, but it drives me crazy that the US version has smaller sized train cards and destination tickets. It makes it annoying to sort through the cards in your hand if you have a lot of train cards. It's also annoying to shuffle the decks. Luckily, the cards for the Europe version are a normal size (think traditional set of cards). As it should be!",4.0
1300,B000809OAO,R2J7PY59GCMQ80,FANTASTIC FAMILY GAME,"  If you are new to Ticket to Ride, I strongly suggest that you start with the original game. Every other version adds an additional level of complexity. This review consists of the Ticket to Ride games which we have purchased and enjoyed playing. I can highly recommend all of them.TICKET TO RIDE (original)The board consists of a map of the U.S. and parts of Canada. Routes are delineated between major cities. The object of the game is to connect routes which are displayed on your personal route cards using train cars. Extra points are awarded for ‚Äúlongest route‚Äù.The game takes about 5 minutes to learn and is loads of fun for the entire family. Each turn, the player chooses from one of three options. Gameplay is rapid. Blink and it‚Äôs your turn again! We all really enjoy this game. I particularly like that there is absolutely no way to tell who is going to win until the end, when each player tallies her or his points. This all but eliminates the competitive element and allows you to just enjoy playing the game.TICKET TO RIDE - EUROPEThe board consists of a European map which will have you scratching your head as you butcher pronunciations. Thankfully, the cards are larger. Added elements include tunnel and ferry routes, train stations, and long route destination cards. While the added elements are very enjoyable, it really helps to be familiar with the original version first.ALVIN AND DEXTOR - Monster Expansion PackPlace your monster on any city and no routes can be claimed in or out of that city until the monster is moved. This is a favorite.USA 1910 EXPANSIONReplace those sissy cards from the original deck with normal-size cards!ASIA: MAP COLLECTION - VOLUME 1The board is two-sided. You can play as teams (which we‚Äôve never done) or play your way through Asia the old-fashioned way. Mountain routes are added.",5.0
1301,B000809OAO,R2LNSDA32CI8NL,Better than the original!,"  I now own Ticket to Ride: Europe and Ticket to Ride: Nordic.  I enjoy Europe, but Nordic remains my favorite.  Here are some of the good and bad things about Ticket to Ride: Europe, compared to both Nordic and the original (USA) version.Pros:+ More complex than the original with the addition of locomotives, tunnels, and stations.  (Stations aren't in Nordic.)+ Plays up to 5 players, a potential improvement on Nordic if you play with larger groups.+ Some cities will be more familiar and easier to find than in Nordic.  (And easier to find if you're European!)Cons:- Art is not as pretty as in Nordic and the cards feel slightly lower quality.- Compared to the US edition, the cities may be unfamiliar and harder to find for American players.- While it scales from 2-5, it does not play as smoothly with 2-3 players as Nordic does.  If you are only/mainly playing with 2-3, I'd highly recommend Nordic over either Europe or the US versions.Overall this a really fun game that can be enjoyed with just about any group.  It is strategic enough to hold your interest while simple enough to teach in 5 minutes.  If you already have the US Ticket to Ride, it's worth getting this one for the added components which make it a slightly heavier game.",5.0
1302,B000809OAO,RVMCYDRYRMKO7,Poor Quality Game,"  Edit - received a replacement; board better but still poor quality compared to original Ticket to Ride game. Main fold point of board is splitting.  Received the 15 train station pieces in the replacement game.  Game play gets a 5 stars, quality of components received get 2 stars.  I just can't get the energy to return this again so I will deal with the flaws.  At least it is playable this time.Original - Poor quality board was wrinkled and warped, making the game essentially unplayable.  Cards and trains were well made. Set was missing 10 of the 15 train station pieces needed to play.  I've played the game before at a friend's house so I know it is fun; just this copy was unplayable.",3.0
1303,B000809OAO,R75DNLQB50C7H,Fun game but names of cities not in English,"  We previously played the US version with friends of ours and decided to purchase the European version. The board is beautiful and there are some fun additions to the game. However one thing that we were not aware of prior to purchasing is that the names of the cities in Europe are written in the language of each country. Sometimes those are very similar to the English word for the city, but sometimes they are extremely different. This makes it much harder to find some of the routes, especially for the people  we previously played the US version with friends of ours and decided to purchase the European version.

1304,B000809OAO,R1ECXC1855112H,Great game to play for those looking for something different,"  I love playing video games but at times I want to take a break from viewing a monitor or TV screen.  My wife and I enjoy a few board games and playing cards, but I wanted some more in-depth to play that is not Monopoly, Sorry, Uno, and etc.  I would love to play games like Risk or something in those veins, but I know she will not be up for it. My first tough was to get Catan, but sadly we need at least three players, and my daughter is barely 8 months, so she doesn‚Äôt count.I was looking for a game that would fit all these requirements and still be fun for her, but be something that was a little different and I remembered a game I got for free on my iPad a few months back called Ticket to Ride.  I remembered having a lot of fun with it but playing against AI was not as fun after a while. I did some research on this game and showed my wife to see if she would be interested.  We found that they had another version that was based in Europe instead of the US, and since we love traveling, we opted to get this out.  Boy, it was a great investment.The night that it came my in-laws were over for dinner, and I asked if they wanted to play.  They said sure to try something else.  I was a little concerned as the instructions were a book, and it had a rule that was not in the iPad game since this was a newer version, but we opted to play the game in sections and introduce more advanced features (such as the Stations, ferries, and tunnels) with each new time we played.My in-laws and wife were hooked on his game. It is so simple to play yet, it is also complicated and provides a nice bit of strategy if you want to win.  If you notice someone is trying to get to a particular place, do you be a jerk and claim that line, but you could risk losing your own line later?  It is really fun to see how each game goes.I will admit the first game we played we had major issues fining some of the Eastern European locations, and none of us have been (or recognize) a few of the names, but after a couple of play thoughts, we now have a great grasp on everything.  What I like is that each game can be done in about 30 min to 1 hour. This is great because anything longer would be too hard, as the baby could wake up and spoil the rest of the game. We have not had this be an issue where a game went over that time frame (yet).The concept for this game is SUPER simple, but it takes a while to master. Mark train lines to get from Point A to Point B in the faster route possible. You do this by collecting a train card.  You have to have a specific color of train cards to claim a route.  What makes this interesting is you can only do one of three things each time it is your turn:1. Claim a Route2. Pull Train Cards (from stack or on the board)3. Get another route cardSo you have to plan each turn carefully.  Is it worth claiming a route, when you see a while card in the open deck?  You are out of routes, but do you use your turn to do something else.  Each route you claim is worth a certain amount of points, and the object is to get the most points before someone has less than two of their own person trains.  Just because you get rid of all your trains doesn‚Äôt mean you win, as we have had a game where other people win as they claimed more complicated routes.This is a great game to play and we look forward to teaching our daughter it when she is a bit older, as it is just different from other games currently out on the market, and it makes for a really great time!",5.0
1305,B000809OAO,RFWMODNWRQOIL,Fast and addicting game but limited to you and 4 others,"  Pros- for a relatively inexperienced boardgame player, this is a pick up and play game with easy to understand rules- game is not heavily reliant on luck and starting first doesnt give a huge advantage. There are multiple strategies that can be used to play the game, increasing replayability.- compared to the original USA version, the train and destination cards are much larger and easier to read- map itself is a bit cluttered, with cities closer to each other. Like Europe in real life. Allows for players to maneuver around one another with more ease.- tunnels and ferries make the locomotive card much more valuable, making it more likely to be picked by a player- fast gameplay allows players to feel engaged. The points obtained by completing destination means that no one white knows which players is in the leadCons- quite expensive expansion packs.- 2-5 player limit can be an issue for folks with larger group of friends. There are some maps that allow 6 players, but I understand that it required teams of 2 and either the Asian expansion or the wild west expansion. Not cheap",5.0
1306,B000809OAO,R3N7DFWLGIWBFY,challenging!,  This game was a present for my 10 year old grandson.  He had play Ticket to Ride America at a friend's house and loved it.  We thought the Europe version would be a little different and also help everyone learn European geography.  However all the cities are printed in old world spellings and were hard to decipher.  Writing them in modern English as well as the names of the countries would be much better.  The game itself is quite fun.  We had 4 of us playing and it took quite a bit longer than an hour.  Also if you bump the board at all the trains move around.  Some way to attach the trains so they don't move would be helpful. It is very challenging mentally and in spite of my complaints we are enjoying it.,4.0
1307,B000809OAO,RI7QLU83N049K,New favorite game,"  Extremely fun game. My game group is pretty diverse in their preferred games, but this one is loved by all. Fair bit of luck, but stragedy definitely comes into play a lot as well. It is also a very visual game so for me ,seeing the trains on the map, quickened the learning curve.I would personally recommend new players start with the American map version though, because the Europe version has added tunnels, and they are confusing. Especially for new players. It would also be easier because as an American, I know where the cities are and I'm not looking all over the board. Also thought I'd mention ita fun as 2 player. Me and my wife played 3 games straight when we opened it.",5.0
1308,B000809OAO,R17QJZIJF28IDE,"Watch an online ""how to play"" video -- but great fun for whole family!","  Despite having multiple ivy grads and PhDs in our family, reading the instruction manual was laborious, painful, and also directed us the wrong way. In fact, we played a couple of rounds totally ""wrong"" (though still had fun). Perhaps if we were board game aficionados and used to the language, it would have made more sense... However, all this could have been avoided by watching a 5minute YouTube video. Lesson learned.That said, this game is great fun! The right mix of strategy, luck, and mild sabotage! For the most part, this is very casual and enjoyable and not much resentment to fellow players--which i personally hate, so great to not have this be one of those! It does get mildly stressful toward the end game, but otherwise a lot more chill than a lot of games can be. As promised, easy to learn for the whole family--just watch a youtube video as i mentioned :)Overall, love it. Glad this was my first version of the game that I was introduced to b/c i think reading reviews of the original, i prefer the game play options in this version (with the train stations).",5.0
1309,B000809OAO,R1I44KSS239F75,Love Europe TTR and its challenging game play,"  This version of TTR is challenging and fun! You have ferry's to cross which require ""wild"" train cards and underground railroads which can leave you in a pinch if the luck of the draw isn't in your favor. This is one of our favorite TTR games because of the numerous destinations and the challenges on the board (ferrys/underground railroads) My daughter likes the tunnels that allow you to connect to another players train in order to complete your destination into cities where multiple train destinations get tricky.  Game play lasts about an hour and we are fairly familiar with the destination locations. This is a stand alone game and does not require another TTR purchase in order to be played.",5.0
1310,B000809OAO,R3DG9RK63YE7TP,"Fun, but not as much as the original","  Complex. We love the Basic Ticket to Ride (also a complex game but SUCH fun)! We'd tired of it, the US map, so decided to add this one to our game closet. I think it's unfortunate that it's an ancient European map; doesn't teach about where the same cities are with contemporary names. I'd like it more if it included the ancient names AND those that are used now. This game has added tunnels and ferries which add some interest. So far, though, I don't think it compares to the original Ticket to Ride.",4.0
1311,B000809OAO,R2AKVB6OX647KV,More of a challenge than classic TTR,"  I first learned Ticket To Ride on the iPhone. I'm used to the American map and the geography makes sense to me. The European map is so foreign, it takes me while to figure out where the cities are and sometimes I forfeit tickets because I mistake some cities for others. On the other hand, I think it is good because I learn new geography and cities.This version has tunnels so it's not as easy as the regular TTR, which I guess should be a plus for me, because I am supposed to like a challenge. I think there is a lot of potential to learn from this game, which may require some research on the cities we are actually visiting.",4.0
1312,B000809OAO,R2MUXVGLF565ZZ,Better than the original,"  If you like Ticket to Ride, you should definitely play this one.  The tunnels and stations add welcome twists to the base game-play.  It is a little challenging to try to locate cities on the map until you memorize them though.  They have old-world names that don't always match up with what they currently are.  However, it still helps you learn some geography during a fun-filled game session.  Also, a nice update for this is that the cards are normal poker-size instead of the little ones in the original.  Overall, I like this one better.",5.0
1313,B000809OAO,R3O8BEFEFIULMH,More involved version of Ticket to Ride for 1-5 players,"  If you have four to five players and are looking for something a bit more meaty than the original Ticket to Ride, this is probably the best version.In my opinion, if you own this version the only reason to play the original Ticket to Ride is if you just love playing on the US map, or if you're playing with people who like the rules to be as simple as possible. Ticket to Ride Europe introduces new elements like tunnels, ferries, and stations, that increase the complexity, but not by much.If you normally play with two or three people, Ticket to Ride Nordic Countries is a better fit as it has a tighter map.",5.0
1314,B000809OAO,R3VG5O8NXFY3XV,Great variation to the original!!,"  This is a refreshing version of the original Ticket to Ride!

It's relatively easy to pick up how to play once you start playing, and the tactile element of placing trains adds to it's enjoyment.My kids are 10 and almost 8, and both enjoy it as much as the grown ups.The board and cards are super high quality, very impressed.Note that this game can take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours to play when using all the trains. Sometimes we remove ~15 trains each to have the game be a bit shorter.",5.0
1316,B000809OAO,RE8S9EYACSVNM,"Love this Game, and Good Geography Lesson Too","  I bought this as a Christmas gift for our 7-year-old after I played it at a meet-up party. The board is full of train tracks and destinations. You draw cards with routes from one destination to another at the start of the game. Then you build track to connect your destinations through the game. You can lay track for as many routes as you can, until someone runs out of track to lay. Then you count up points to see who won. The rules are a little complex, but make it a very fun game to play. It really grows on you. Once you figure out some of the strategies, it becomes more fun. You are supposed to keep your route, and your track cards secret, but I have found with new players, it is easier to make all of these visible for the first couple of games, so that everyone can help each other and get used to the rules.I bought the Europe version specifically because it has double tracks in a lot of places. We live in the U.S., and I was going to buy the U.S. version. Someone at the meet-up made the astute suggestion that I stick with Europe if I was buying for a child, because the U.S. version only has single tracks. It was very good advice. When a set of tracks is taken up, it is a lot more difficult to get to reach a destination, and this can be frustrating for the younger child. We may buy the U.S. version in the future. There are several versions, and they are not all the same. The game, Risk, helped me remember where places were in Europe and Asia. This game will do that also.My 3 older kids are 21, 24, and 26. They have talked about ""gaming meet-ups"" for a long time, but I never understood what they were until a visit to my 24 y/o's last fall. He sent me rules to a bunch of games before I went, to prepare me. Ticket to Ride was one of them. I assumed we would be playing computer games. Nope. Apparently the 20-something crowd has taken board game parties to a new level. Meet-ups are loosely organized groups, arranged online, where people get together just to play board games. My 24 y/o and his girlfriend took me to a Halloween party one in Phoenix, complete with costumes. There were all kinds of people there, including college professors. Some of these people apparently become lifelong friends. They told me Ticket To Ride was one of the regular games they played. So it is up to snuff.",5.0
1317,B000809OAO,R1A0TOCGV0DDA,My Favorite Version of My Favorite Board Game,"  I first started playing the original Ticket to Ride (USA map) with friends several years ago and fell in love with it.  I'd always wanted to buy the game for myself but one thing or another would get in the way causing me to have to postpone.  A couple months ago a friend suggested to me that I should buy the Ticket to Ride Europe version when I finally got the chance because it had some really great added elements.  I took their word of advice and decided to get the European version, and I haven't been disappointing.  While I still love the original Ticket to Ride it has been a lot of fun to test my European geography skills.  The names of cities are written in historical/local names instead of current names (ie. Moskova instead of Moscow, Wien instead of Vienna) so some of my friends had trouble catching their bearings but they caught on quickly.  I like the added element of being given the choice of completing one long route for many points (the long route cards are kept desperately from the other route cards) instead of solely shorter routes or having the long routes mixed in to all of the route cards.  I also like the added element of train stations which, especially in route laden western Europe is sometimes the only way you can complete your routes when so many people are going for the same paths.The only con is the game can be kind of dull to play with only 2 people, oftentimes I find that we end up playing on opposite sides of the continent, never crossing paths, but with more than two it can get quite complicated and exciting.",5.0
1318,B000809OAO,R2I09H3751BCOX,Cross-Country Adventure!,"  Having loved and played ""Ticket to Ride"" countless numbers of times, I decided it was time to buy Ticket to Ride Europe. It's pretty amazing, and comes with a couple more challenges than the original game. (I love trying to pronounce all the old cities of Europe.) The basic rules are the same as they are in Ticket to Ride, gameplay follows the same general order. On your turn, you collect train car cards to get enough to go from one city to another, (If the track has three green spaces, you need three green cards) to accomplish the route on your destination tickets. ""Europe"" comes with train stations allowing you to connect easier, and also the foreboding ferries and tunnels. The ferries are routes that cross any body of water (makes sense, right?) and you must have, in addition to your cards of the same color, however many locomotives (wild cards) shown on that part of your route. (Example: ""Palermo"" to ""Roma"" is a gray track ferry with 4 parts. One of them must be a wild and the other three could be a matching three of any color.) Then there are the tunnels, which are like others, except, after you lay down your cards, before placing your trains on the board, you must flip over the first three cards on the train car card draw deck. If one, two or all three are either the colors you are playing to go from city to city, or wilds, you must have that many more cards of that color (or wilds.) Example: you are trying to go from ""Paris"" to ""Zurich"" (which is a gray tunnel route, 3 long), so you play two blues and a wild card. Before placing your trains on the board, you flip over the first card. Say it's a green. No problem. Then, you flip over a second card and it's a white. Good so far. Then, flip over the last card and it's a wild (which counts as a blue.) This means, you must (in addition to the three cards you are playing) play one more blue or wild card in your hand to go on that route. If there were two flipped over, you must have an additional two, and the same if all three. (Of course, there are times when none of the three present a problem and you can play your route like normal, which is nice.) If you don't have either a blue or a wild, you cannot play there and your turn ends. Now, that was kind of a long-winded example, but it makes it quite a bit harder, especially if you have a route that has many tunnel tracks. It can also be VERY frustrating. To sum it up, Ticket to Ride Europe is a very fun game that is easily taught, easily learned and easily played.Anyways,",5.0
1319,B000809OAO,R2LVPR1MOAFNOE,We always had ticket to ride (US),"  Wow I got this for a gift, my friend is from Germany.

We have played it like the U.S. version so far  but will add the tunnel part in as people become more familiar with the game. This will make the game more interesting for sure.",5.0
1320,B000809OAO,R2QR2CBC9ADB7P,The most fun I've had for ages with a game.,"  It's all up to you! Pick your cards for the route and go for it by collecting your series of trains to build your line. Oops! Did someone cut you off? Pick another route and keep moving. Don't forget, along the way that you can also pick other route cards that might be little spurs and gain you big points in the end-game count-up for the winner. don't forget to keep counting how many trains you have left because you can find yourself snookered by one piece and not reach your final destination. Sorry no points for a half-done train line from Constantinople to Zagreb! Tooot- Tooot! Love this game!",5.0
1321,B000809OAO,R37QVSOY7UBWZD,"Great Game, Fun.","  I read the reviews on this game and watched some YouTube video reviews as well and decided to purchase it for some new euro style gaming.  I previously had purchased another euro style game called Carcassonne which is now a family favorite (or should I say favourite) and I was looking for something else to add to the gaming mix.Ticket To Ride Europe fit with what I was looking for.  I first compared the two prominent versions of the game: the USA map to the Europe map and read comparison reviews on them both before deciding to buy.  I went with the Europe version of the game because it seems there were more route paths to connect your cities compared to the USA map.  What I did not expect was the names of the European cities to be really old and spelled differently than what I am used to now.  I think it was done this way to fit into the time period, but not being that familiar with the old names of the European cities it was difficult for us to determine our various routes.  The route cards do show a mini map though with highlights in the general area of the two cities you need to connect, but it is still a bit difficult especially for the younger kids in the family.  What this means is that we need to take extra time in looking at our route cards and the map to decide on our paths to build.Other than getting used to the city names the only other minor downside I see in the game is that there are so many train pieces.  You have to be really careful not to drop them all over the place when picking up.  The game does come with 2 extra train pieces per color which is good in case you lose a couple.  After that though you may have to dock everyone a piece if you really start losing some (or buy a new game).Regarding the game play, it is great!  Not too difficult to learn at all and once everyone knows what they have to do it moves along at a good pace.  Although our initial games of 4 and then 5 people lasted about 2.5 hours each to play which everyone thought was a bit too long.  The non players passing through the room kept making comments like ""You guys are STILL playing that game?!?!"" and ""When the hell is it going to be over already?!?"".  But those of us playing the game were not fatigued at all by the amount of time it was taking us to get through it.  I think it is conceivable to have a game last maybe 1.5 hours on average.Overall, the family really liked this game.  It is definitely a must for a unique and new type of gaming experience that is interactive and not just your boring roll the dice and move type thing.  I will be getting the Ticket To Ride 1912 Expansion pack for this game as well since I have read it adds a couple more elements to the play in addition to some new route cards.UPDATE: It has been about 1 year now since I had the game and I did get the 1912 expansion which adds a ton more route cards to the game.  We have been playing this game so much that the base routes kept coming up and it was getting a bit boring.  It seemed like we were always getting the same routes game after game.  The 1912 Expansion is a MUST.  My family is addicted to this game and even more so with the 1912 expansion.  This is a GREAT GAME.",5.0
1322,B000809OAO,R1B5D1AFQ6PJ2C,Love this game,"  The cities are listed in their native language, so it is sometimes hard to find them on the board, but the cards have little maps on them which helps.

Playing took about an hour and was fun for all of us, ages 9, 11, and two adults. Obviously the next time we play we won't need to learn the rules again so that will save time, but it was worth it to understand everything first. We're excited to play again!

1324,B000809OAO,R1A6Y3NY2P879P,Strikes a Very Nice Balance,"  My husband and I are strategy game, card game, ""Euro Game,"" etc. enthusiasts. This is a board game that I've wanted for awhile and am so glad I finally ordered. Pretty artwork. Fun. Can be played by 2, but having a few more players adds more competition to it as you become less likely to complete your goals when vying with several players for the same train tracks. The thing I really like about this game is that it has some strategy to it without being nearly as complex as hard core strategy games to either teach or play. We certainly enjoy those games, but it can, understandably, be tedious to some family and friends to spend hours learning many of the games we have, especially if they're not total game geeks or won't be playing them again anytime soon, so I wanted something we could offer to a wider range of guests, that'd be fun for all. This is one of those nice, ""invite the fam and friends of nearly all patience levels, who enjoy games but aren't total game geeks to sit down and have fun playing while not being bored ourselves"" games. Anyone we've introduced it to (frequent gamers and occasional alike) has enjoyed it, it leaves room for as much visiting as playing, and we do find it fun ourselves!",5.0

I wish I'd chosen the American version, just because the names of places are from the old days (I know, this shouldn't have been a surprise to me!) so we've had to learn the place names which can make it a little trickier. The first couple times out were a bit rough, but once we all had the gist of it we loved it. My kids also like Catan, so perhaps if your family enjoys that, this is another good option.",5.0

We played it for the first time on Boxing Day with my family and after reading the monologue of rules (only downside) we just got stuck into it and it all came together. Made much more sense and much more enjoyable when we got stuck in and played. Just fair warning, the rules seem a little overwhelming at first (especially when you read them out). Much easier if you get the gist and then just start playing. It makes loads more sense.Game differences from the original works great for me. I kinda purchased this game for these new additions. Most of my friends are new to boardgames so games that are tough/non-forgiving can be too off-putting. I really like the use of the stations, tunnels and ferries. The tunnels really add an aspect of luck-of-the-draw to the game, which isn't everyone's favourite but I thought it helped even out the game play between veterans and beginners. It can be frustrating missing out on a tunnel, believe me, I tried 4 times to get one tunnel to win the game but even to my last play, I missed out on the draw. But it made for a very dramatic and suspenseful game, everyone was hanging out to see if I would get it.I would recommend tallying up your trains at end of game play and re-calculating your points. It's easy to forget to move your counter and most of time we've been out a couple of points.",5.0

1328,B07Y5P1YHR,R29KOET4R2BHGP,Worth Every Penny-Not for kids,"  At first glance, we weren't really sure about this game. Even reading the description my friends and I weren't sure if we wouldn't regret trying it out or not. We were all extremely surprised and now it's a new game night favorite. Definitely not for kids as there are quite a few adult questions in there but I know we had to of upset the neighbors as loud as our debates and laughter were getting. The dice makes it quite a bit more challenging which is great to a point but eventually, we stopped using it just to get through it easier. I would definitely recommend this to any adults looking for a great game night board game. Well worth the money!",5.0

My husband and I tried it out, just the two of us, and we still had fun, though I can imagine with more answers it would be an even better time! It reminded us of Scattergories, though this one is a more adult version and a bit more flexible. The one criticism we had was that the timer is way too short to actually get answers on the board, so we ended up giving ourselves extra time to complete each round. I really like the whiteboard concept, so that you're able to reuse the boards over and over instead of using paper each time. We laughed a lot while playing this game, and I would recommend it as an awesome party game!",5.0

The age on the box says 13+, honestly, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable playing with my young adult children.  There are a good number of questions about adult topics.  You might find yourself explaining a lot of questions you‚Äôd rather not deal with during a game with children. The game was fun while we played it.  We decided it was better to keep score counting all your correct answers, than just giving one point to the round winner. We did have one dry erase marker that was dried up. Overall, a fun game for adults.",4.0

1338,B07Y5P1YHR,R36FFQ8XJ1YPCW,A great game of conversation!,  This game can be challenging for each participant playing. The game calls for serious feedback if the answer is up for discussion.

1339,B07Y5P1YHR,R3CN4UP15VCIP,Fun new game for parties and home alike!,"  Off Topic is a great game for parties or just having fun with your family. With 2-8 players, it works well in all situations. For those of you who remember Scattergories, this game is similar to that, only BETTER! It is easy to learn and play, but also surprisingly challenging.All players are given dry erase boards and markers on which to write their answers down. No worries about running out of papers/scoresheets or finding enough pens for everyone! Then each player uses the same topic card and a dice is rolled to give you a letter that all your answers must start with. Then it is up to you to come up with the most unique answers! Topics range from simple (vehicles) to more complex (words that describe a woman‚Äôs period), and also sometimes give you a sentence to fill in the blanks for  (similar to Cards Against Humanity). With a 2 minute timer, it is hard to entirely fill in every answer on the spot! But that is a good thing!My only critique would be that the game uses an hourglass type sand timer, and unless you are looking at it you don‚Äôt always know when time is up. A timer that made a sound when it is done would be easier.Highly recommend this game though!",5.0
1340,B07Y5P1YHR,R3THJKFKJ4V86H,My new favorite game to play with friends or family,"  When I got this delivered, I was SO impressed with the packaging. It's super high quality all around which I really appreciate. Great unboxing experience.I (25f) played this with my boyfriend and family and we had so much fun!  It definitely does get off topic. One of my favorite parts is defending the answers, we had so many laughs fighting for our points.Watch the how to play video also it's really helpful, 1st round was all of our first times and it was more of a test run and every round after that was seamless. Not one of those games where you spend too long learning the rules.I also love that this game is super versatile, it can be more family friendly or very adult just depends on who you play it with. It makes it have endless possibilities for every get together.This would be a great gift, I already plan on getting it for some birthdays.Overall I highly recommend this game if you want endless laughs from it and a great looking game!",5.0

An hour later we both were laughing so hard we could barely write the answers down! He loves it because no matter what you write, the answer is correct as long as it starts with the correct letter! I love it because it really makes you think, so your answer is chosen as  the best one! I can't wait until our family gets together to play this hilarious game!",5.0
1342,B07Y5P1YHR,R2SI6IRHZ8G3ED,It‚Äôs fine,  Found this a bit difficult to play. This is very similar to Scategories but more obscure and slightly more adult oriented.

1345,B07Y5P1YHR,R1AUYXJWZZXIHD,"Hilarious game, and you will learn so much about your friends!","  Personally, I love these types of games.  You get the subject and have to give the answer you think will best appeal to the person judging.  Half of the fun is just getting to know what your friends think you will find humorous and worth choosing.  It becomes as much about what you know about each other as it does what you can come up with for an answer.The game itself is eminently replayable and super easy to pick up.  At five rounds, it's fast paced and fun and usually leads to at least three or four play throughs in an evening.  One of the greatest things is how you can find ways to play it via video chat during these at home times.  Very few games allow for that, and being able to find ways to stay entertained right now is so important.  This sits on my shelf right next to my other go to party games, and I am sure I will be playing it for many years to come!Side note, the box art is fantastic.",5.0
1346,B07Y5P1YHR,R16N52QM00QG5R,Great game,"  I didn't have the highest expectations for this game, but it was definitely a big hit for our group. We found that having more players made it a lot more challenging and fun. With only 4 players, we rarely had repeated answers. However, once we got up to 8 players, it was a lot more fun trying to purposely be more creative to avoid repeated answers. We played for hours on end. The only additional suggestion I would have is to preemptly grab some extra dry erase markers since a few had some untimely failures during rounds.",5.0
1347,B07Y5P1YHR,R3P5I1PA3FYY2T,Good Gift Idea for Game People,"  First, the materials used for this game are top-notch.  The feel and stability of the box let‚Äôs me know it will stand up to years in the closet.  I love the dry erase board concept and the ones provided are awesome.  My only real complaint is that the top of the dry erase marker is an eraser and doesn‚Äôt really hold onto the pen when open and placed on top like a cap.  Nothing about this game feels cheap - it would be a good gift.  The game itself is fun.  We had a good time playing it around a dinner table.  The play allows for an interpretation of the rules, which for a social setting, is a good thing.  You can‚Äôt have that annoying stickler that won‚Äôt let you fill up a free parking pot, ya know?  We played a few rounds, enjoyed ourselves, and put it away in a reachable place.  I would recommend this for your smart/clever friends.",5.0
1348,B07Y5P1YHR,R3OE1Y32HX13C3,Great game for all ages.,  This game has caused some of our family members to truly laugh until they peed their pants. The only thing that I would change is the timer be a buzzer rather than an hourglass due to attempting to rush the answers while also trying to watch the hourglass. However.. this game has the ability to be a fun rated PG game with kids on family night or change the rules a little bit and it can be a great addition to an evening with friends a be a bit more wild.,5.0

Prior to the game, I made sure to cover the topics that I deemed age inappropriate with white electrical tape that could easily be removed when playing with my adult friends, and the fun began.

This game will have you laughing and in stitches, and talking smack nonstop to each other. It's easy to learn and even easier to play. I hope one day they make a digital app version so that I could play with people online. As an added bonus, me being a huge DnD nerd, it was a giant 20 sided die. It's so cool.

1418,B086B7QPTB,R220D1OKUBIVVX,Great for Marvel fans but just misses the mark as a great villainous game.,"  This was a HUGE step down in quality from the other villainous games/expansions. The villian pieces have almost a plastic dollar store feel to them. The villian boards are also designed so differently this time around with the villian artwork being on both sides of the play board (the other side is the special ability space) and what seems like a cheaper cardboard than what was used for printing in the past. The game play still holds up and you can tell their heart was in the right place with this one but it just missed the mark as a great rendition of an already solid game. If you're a Marvel fan this is a great game to have but as an extra addition to your Villainous collection, Just know you're getting into a very different game than the others.",3.0
1419,B086B7QPTB,R2EO3ZQYPIDGTC,Did they play test this? 1v1 unplayable,"  I don't really care about some of the build quality complaints you'll see in other reviews, it's fine. Maybe not as polished as the others but it doesn't effect game play.I've played twice so far. Once with Ultron vs. Hella. Ultron won pretty easily but Hela did manage to put a few points on the board. Then I played Thanos vs. Hela and Hela got absolutely stomped. We had to stop playing, I had 3/6 infinity stones and Hela was no where near accomplishing any portion of her objective. Maybe it works with more players but one on one just isn't fun.The instructions are also vague in a few cases. The worst example is Thanos' ability to attack allies in other people's realms. No where does it tell you where to put Thanos' allies. Do they go in the Hero slot? Do they go on the bottom with the other villains allies? No clue. Putting them on the top makes Thanos even more unstoppable.I'd love if the publishers read this review and somehow fixed this. I was so excited to play it.",2.0
1420,B086B7QPTB,R1UMEGJ86W6Y1N,As a collector with the Original set I'm disappointed.,"  I very rarely leave reviews on products I purchase because I'm a bad a consumer of products, but I'll make an exception for this.Villainous is a great board game that is super easy to learn with a decent skill ceiling to offer a little for everyone. That being said, for a collector the ORIGINAL sets are very high quality and great pieces for any collection. The character pieces are cast in a clear plastic with a satisfying weight to them, the game boards are a nice thick board, and the plastic well for the game pieces are in the center is a solid color plastic center piece that looks nice. MARVEL Villainous does not hold up to this standard. The character pieces are still unique models that are nice to look at, but they are light, hollow, and do not hold up to the originals. The boards do not hold up to the original with the way they fold, and the thick/quality of the board they used for it is less than the original. The center dome is a clear plastic flimsy garbage that is disgraceful compared to the original.The only things that hold up to the original so far are the new fate ""EVENTS"" that are printed on a nice thick cardboard, and the original art that is always appreciated. I do like Villainous quite a bit, but I will say that I'm unsure if I will collect all the additional versions of the MARVEL Villainous in the same way I collected the original Disney Villainous so far due to the change in quality of pieces. As a collector it bothers me a bit more, but in terms of a fun game I'd say it's still great. If you like Marvel check it out, if you want a better looking set I'd say go for the original. Either way Villainous is one of my favorite games to play with friends because of the simplicity and how nice the set looks.EDIT: As a follow up. The game plays as good if not better than the original set. Characters feel like they ramp up in a more satisfying way and heavily interact even though things like ""condition"" cards have been removed from the decks. The single Fate deck that is drawn from is a fantastic idea that gives me ""Marvel Champions"" vibes. Thanos is one of the best designed characters, but is not new player friendly due to his seemingly infinite unique rules that aren't heavily outlined in the rule book.",3.0
1421,B086B7QPTB,R35SU4GLP282PR,"If I could snap my fingers, I'd make this a good game.","  My partner and I are huge fans of the Villainous series.  I personally was stoked when they announced there was going to be a Marvel version of the game.  I will say my disappointment.....was very apparent after playing a few games.The good: the villains do have a great theme to them.  Thanos and seeking out his stones, for instance, is a blast theme wise.  It is also fun to see some of my favorite Marvel personalities come into play.The bad: Whew.  Where to start.  First and foremost, this game is NOT good in a 1v1 setting.  The fate mechanic in Disney was used a bit of a catch up mechanic, which I think is missing in Marvel.  The shared fate pool is great in theory, but the execution is lacking.  Not every villain's fate cards do much to stop other villains in the same manner.  There is the added effect of drawing fate cards on your turn that can allow you to dodge the bullets that would stop you.  It's a mess.  I would have much preferred fate cards that hit everyone just as well with a kicker if assigned to a certain villain.The rules are very inconsistent and messy as well.  There are a number of interactions (see Taskmaster and Killmonger's Rook for example).  There is a need for bolding words that are actions vs using that word in a sentence later on.  Overall, you can tell that the Covid crisis really played a part in the quality control of the rules.  Plus, it seems like it is a race to see who can turbo fate their opponents, at least in 1v1, the quickest to win.  In the games I have played or watched, that is who usually wins.I really wanted to like this game as I am THE target audience for it.  As is, I will not be buying future expansions and will only be playing the game at someone else's request.  If we have too many, I will be the first to volunteer to sit out as I do not want to participate in the head scratching of rules questions.  I wish the best of luck to this line, but as is, I cannot recommend it and will actively talk my friends out of buying it.",2.0
1422,B086B7QPTB,R3APUS4R4W514H,"Same game, different feel","  The gameplay is fun, as always; however, there a few things that are preventing me from giving a higher rating.1. Noticeable decline in game piece quality. One thing I‚Äôve loved about the Disney Villainous series up to this point is the creative game pieces and overall high quality of the cards, artwork, boards, etc. As soon as I opened the Marvel box, I could tell something was different. The game pieces have a metallic look and are lighter, cheaper plastic. The cards are thin and stick together more than I remember with previous expansions (highly recommend getting card sleeves). Even the character booklets feel different.2. The choice to not make it compatible with the Disney line. I‚Äôm sure since many of the mechanics are the same that someone online will figure out a good way to play with both sets, but it is a bit of a bummer that the company went that route. Disney owns both properties, so it would‚Äôve been fun to have matchups like Ultron vs Ursula.3. Repeat cards. Seems like there are fewer unique cards in each deck (this could be a misunderstanding on my part). Not a huge deal as the new twist on the fate deck and the introduction of events keeps things interesting but it just adds to the overall sense that this was more rushed/cheaply produced than some of the others in the villainous series.Overall, if you are already a fan of the Villainous series (or Marvel), you will find plenty to enjoy in this release. The above is mostly nitpicks because I am a big fan of the series, overall. As with previous installments, there are new ideas in play that keep things fresh and engaging. I do like how players are no longer isolated in their own boards and the twist on the fate deck is a great addition.",3.0
1423,B086B7QPTB,R2SRM6AMKKWVQ0,Great game but damaged,  I was so exited when this arrived early. Villanous is a great series of games. This version is no less so.

That one delicate part that will always make me wary of playing it incase it rips and is destroyed beyond my repair.,3.0
1424,B086B7QPTB,R1BJMMIS4KQ7E7,Cheap & Incompatible,"  I am a huge fan of Villainous; however, this game misses the mark.The components are cheaply made and are a significant downgrade from the original and subsequent expansions.It is also hugely disappointing that the game is not compatible with the previous releases. I would have loved to have Hela go head to head with Hades, or see Ultron versus Ursula, but alas, the world will never know. They also needlessly changed certain terminology, symbology, and mechanics that does not add to the gameplay or theme.It ultimately feels like a cash grab from Disney. Take a successful game, slap a popular IP on it, and make it incompatible with the others (so people are forced to pay for essentially the same game twice).That said, this game is still fun and adds new features that take Villainous to the next level.But the downgraded components, needless terminology and mechanic changes, and incompatibility with other Villainous games take a 5-star game down to 3-stars.",3.0
1425,B086B7QPTB,RTEXA3C1VHJFL,Asymmetric Marvel Fun,  It's a great asymmetric game and perfect twist on the Villainous games.

I loved Disney Villainous and have all the expansions and assumed that the Marvel Villainous would also be of the same quality, but I was quite disappointed.Firstly, the quality of the components are a big step down compared to the disney version. The player tokens feel light and made of cheap plastic compared to Disney. See pictures.The cardboard token vault is also cheap.As for the cards themselves, the creators didn't proof read them before sending them out. There are quite a few misprints and visual errors. For example there is a Random 0 cost symbol on the power stone that should not be there. There is also a typo on Thanos‚Äô ‚ÄúTaste of cosmic power‚Äù card. See pictures. There are 2 that are considered items and the third is considered an effect. Which one should it be? The texts reads more like an effect. But 2/3 are items???As for the rule book. Many of the rules are vague and left to interpretation. For example Killmonger‚Äôs ‚Äúexplosives‚Äù card. When and How do you ‚Äúremove‚Äù. Why not just say discard?As for the balance of the game, the creators should have play tested more. It is way too easy to win with Taskmaster and Hela. There should be a way to destroy or limit the power of the ‚ÄúTraining Dummy‚Äù or it gets too easy.Won with Taskmaster vs Ultron 3 times in around 15 minutes per game. Hela vs Ultron was competitive but also easy for Hela.All in all, I was excited about the game but feel that Ravensburger were too quick to release it and didn‚Äôt take the time needed to perfect the game as they did with Disney.",2.0

The quality on this product sucked. Not only are their errors on some of the cards but the plastic character tokens looked and feel like cheap substitutes.The playing decks are made out of a paper cardboard that sticks and virtually makes the cards impossible to shuffle.We made a lot of ‚Äòinterpretations‚Äô while playing Disney Villainous but usually could enjoy it.

Part of what we loved about DV was that while each villain played a little different, the overall game was relatively easy to pick up - you didn‚Äôt have to spend a long time explaining things to new players.  MV is a lot more complex - and while some may see that as a positive, I do not.  If you‚Äôre playing with first time players, it will be very difficult to jump into the advanced rules.Finally, this game is a LOT more PvP than the DV games ... DV was mostly PvE with a small amount of PvP thrown in ... it meant players never really felt targeted even by fate actions, as they were playing against their unique win conditions.  MV is designed to put players against each other to achieve their win condition ... making this a far different experience than DV.Finally, the rules themselves are incredibly complex, and not well explained - lacking even a FAQ and expanded guide on the website.In the end it‚Äôs not a BAD game - the elements are there.  But it‚Äôs not the game we thought we were getting - not only in the lack of compatibility, but in the very play style.  Perhaps a different name should have been chosen.",3.0
1429,B086B7QPTB,R2KOW18M1J5BBK,Not an Expansion,"  This game is very similar to, but NOT an expansion of, the Disney Villainous game. The villain pieces are hard plastic instead of soft plastic and a few game mechanics are changed, but my ""uninitiated"" (board game noobs) friends like this one substantially more than the Disney Version. Lots of fun and more interactive than the Disney game.",5.0
1430,B086B7QPTB,R3COWL2G9RZJFT,"Unnecessarily confusing, but generally enjoyable addition to Villainous line for experienced players","  Overall, I‚Äôm happy that I purchased this game, but it will not be pulled out as often as the Disney versions are in my house. I don‚Äôt have any issues with the quality of the game like prior reviewers, with one exception - the common fate deck cards are just slightly thicker than the individual villain fate decks which makes them difficult to shuffle. My concerns are primarily with the game play. To give context, my sister and I are both avid Disney Villainous fans and have played all of the expansions more times than we can count  - it‚Äôs one of our favorite games. I‚Äôm writing this review after playing every possible character combination in a 2 player game at the easy and medium levels. Here are my thoughts:1. Instructions are not clear for several game mechanics, but particularly for Ultron. There‚Äôs no guidance on how to meet his objectives and it is not intuitive. We finally figured it out by watching a play through on Ravensburgers YouTube channel and searching forums. We had to do that WAY too many times when first playing the characters. We probably would have been fairly confused and given up if we hadn‚Äôt been so well versed in Disney Villainous.2. There‚Äôs no real ‚Äúmatch‚Äù for Thanos. Whoever plays him will likely win. The closest we‚Äôve gotten to defeating him was during a three hour match between him and Taskmaster - and he still won.3. One game between two people took THREE HOURS!!! Granted, it was a bit of an anomaly in our experience, but this wasn‚Äôt even at the hardest level. At points, I just wanted to be defeated so we could finally end the game. We have not yet worked up the stamina for the ‚Äúundying‚Äù level...and may never do so.4. On the plus side, we LOVE the concept of the common fate deck and events. Unfortunately, way too often, fate is not in our favor and we pull cards not intended for the person being fated. This makes it possible for luck to heavily influence the game - much more so than in the Disney versions.5. The objectives of each character have varying levels of interest. My sister and I both agreed on this ranking of how fun each character was to play: 1. Thanos, 2. Hela, 3. Taskmaster, 4. Kilmonger, 5. Ultron. We felt there was some ‚Äúmagic‚Äù missing in some of these initial characters, particularly Kilmonger and Ultron.Final note: as I said above, we don‚Äôt regret purchasing the game - it does add some unique elements to the Villainous premise that we really enjoyed. However, we would only recommend to experienced players who have already played Disney Villainous due to the vagueness of the rules. We would also recommend, to even out the characters, that the least experienced person plays Thanos. I feel like there is a lot of potential in this version of the game, and I hope Ravensburger takes player feedback into account in any additional expansions.P.S. We desperately want a Harry Potter Villainous, though we recognize the challenges in doing so with only a few options for ‚Äúvillains‚Äù. We have ideas on how to do so! :)",4.0
1431,B086B7QPTB,RYI03PC7KA0JH,Fantastic Game,"  I‚Äôm in love with the Villainous Games, and the Marvel edition is no exception. Contained in its own universe, rather than an expansion, this one comes with features unique to the Marvel universe. They have even made different ways, or levels, for many different ways to play. This is a game that gets different every time you play it, and varies with the amount of people playing. A bonus thing is that it doesn‚Äôt get boring when only two people are playing. Love this game!",5.0
1432,B086B7QPTB,RIPGP5KWU75OL,Cheaply made and arrived damaged,"  As an owner or every version of the Villianous series, I was very excited to add this to my collection.The box arrived, we excitedly opened it only to find one of the pieces already broken. It can be repaired with some glue, but its still a shame.This product is advertised as ""High Quality"" but this is considerably lacking compared to its counterparts. The plastic is very thin and flimsy and will probably all be broken very soon. A complete 180 from the previous versions where the pieces feel solid with a comfortable and reassuring weight to them.Not what I expected for the price point or from the developers. I was definitely disappointed in the overall quality.",2.0
1433,B086B7QPTB,R3PP2H4F0IZH9Q,Disappointing quality.,"  I am fan of the original Villainous and enjoy it a lot. Mostly for its art and the quality of the pieces.Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt say the same for this version.Both art and quality felt like a downgrade from the original version. This being most notable in the movers. The material that is built with feels very cheap and instead of being inspired by what represents the character, It directly portrays the character. It does not hinder the gameplay but it feels disappointing compared to the Disney version.I have only played the game once 1v1. It felt very unbalanced but it was nice nonetheless.",4.0
1434,B086B7QPTB,R3PXIGTHDJPWZD,Game night pick,  Loved this game. Loved all the original expansion pack that came before it. The only thing I wish that would have been different is if they made more of distinction that this is much different from the version that comes before it. Also they need to do a better job with the rules book. I recommend watching a YouTube how to video when you get stuck.,4.0
1435,B086B7QPTB,R2HDL1PIVSZHXW,Incomplete product.,"  This game is functionally incomplete, there are massive holes in the rules and gameplay that effectively require the owner to write some new rules to make the game functional and prevent certain characters from being OP. On top of the character pieces, I would compare them to a McDonald's Kids Meal toy. Poor quality with relatively little creativity to their abstract design. Unlike the character pieces from Disney villainous which are quite nice and heavy duty. It feels like this game was rushed out just to make money.",2.0

That being said, the game pieces, unlike all the other expansion, are made with a cheap plastic compared to the others that are almost like a waxy material.

1440,B086B7QPTB,RMLYTCDIVIB9U,"Better Game, Worse Quality","  Much more interactive than the previous Disney versions where you're often just playing by yourself, though the quality of the cards and pieces is a joke for this price.

1477,B00000J0JF,R1NN75P1WVEH7W,Engaging and challenging board game for young kids,"  I have been a board game lover all my life. I am always open for a traditional game of chess or go, a family night of Trivial Pursuit or Scrabble or an all-out nerd night with Shadows Over Camelot or Warhammer. My 3.5 yeard old son seems to have also acquired this interest, so I am now in a quest to find games that we both enjoy playing together.Last November I came across Labyrinth, a game I had not considered before due to its childish-looking cover. Even it was rated 8+, I decided to give it a try due to the overwhelming good reviews in Amazon. Oh, what a right decision! Labyrinth is that kind of game where the concept, the gameplay and the artwork come together to provide a masterpiece of family entertainment. But enough general praise; let me give you the detail of why I love this game.THE RULES- In labyrinth, you have a deck of cards. Every turn, you look at your top card in the deck and then try to bring your pawn to the right place in the board where that item is. So if your top card is the sword, you will have to move your pawn to the place where the sword is- The labyrinth does not always have a path to the item you want to pick. That is why there is an extra tile. You can insert this tile from any of the yellow arrows (look at the picture of my son inserting a tile). This will shift all that line, and reshape the whole labyrinth so you can have a path- To win, you need to find all the treasures shown in your cards and go back to the start point- While the rules might look simple at first, the gameplay is simply fantastic. Introducing the tiles allow you to change the shape of the labyrinth, or even shift the position of yourself or your rivals! As we play more often, we find more creative ways of playing - and sometimes to obstruct each other, heheheDESIGN AND QUALITY- First of all, the game comes in a beautifully decorated box. Once open, it has compartments to store the pawns/cards/tiles. This is already a plus compared to other ""modern"" games that expect you to dump everything in a mess into the box- The tiles, same as the board, are made of hard cardboard. I got a little surprised at first (I was expecting hard plastic), but now that I have got used to them I feel them sturdy and durable- The pawns that you use to play are simply superb. The Wizard, the Warlock, the Witch and the Sorceress (that's what I have name them, you can look at the picture). Thank you, Ravensburger, for spending a little extra money in making each of them unique and not just make the same figure in four colors!- The tiles slide very well when pushed; sometimes they get stuck if the line of tiles is not fully aligned, but after a few games you will get use to this and it will not bother you- The artwork has a mixture of childish-looking and art. My son loves the sword and the dragon the most!RECOMMENDED AGE- In general, I recommend this game for children 5-6 if you are willing to spend time to teach them, and 8 if you want them to learn the rules quickly- Yes, I am playing it with my 3.5 year old, but I still need to help him a lot. He can figure out how to move his pawn around the labyrinth to the next treasure, and even insert the tile for a small, easy labyrinth reshape. But for more complex moves he needs my help. Don't get me wrong, I love playing it with him, but unless you are a nerd like me you might be better with other games such as¬†

The Game of Life Junior Game

  ¬†or¬†

Monopoly Junior Board Game

  , or even¬†

ThinkFun Rush Hour

  ¬†if you have patience to teach him. You can check my reviews of these games if you are interested.- If you are thinking to bu this game to play with adults only (no kids), I might not recommend it so much though. I think traditional games like Risk or Scrabble, or more advance games like¬†

Catan 5th Edition

  ,

Pandemic Board Game

  ¬†or¬†

Shadows Over Camelot

  ¬†will be more challenging and engaging for mature playersOverall, Labyrinth is definitely a 5-star game with a unique gameplay. I expect it to remain as one of our most often plays games for the next few years!",5.0
1478,B00000J0JF,RG4RUIRFJYRH5,Get this game! Now!,"  The overwhelming number of 5 star reviews isn't a lie!We opened up this game less than 24 hours ago and my kids have played it at least 10 times now, with my husband and I participating a few times as well.  It has so much re-playability since it's really never the same game each time you play, and requires the addictive sort of problem solving style critical thinking that rewards both kids and adults a sense of pride in their cognitive skills.The board and cards are very nice quality, better than most typical board games (which is, I hope, why the price is a but higher than those other games), but the fun makes up for that.  I have no regrets with it.We do have a four year old that plays, even though the game recommends 7+.  She will need help occasionally, but she does understand the concept of the game.  It's so fun finding games that appeal to a range of ages, so that no younger children are left out (something that happens too often when the older kids want to play more complex games).Hope this review was helpful!  Get this game!",5.0
1479,B00000J0JF,R27EEU2L3BE6SE,Totally Awesome older game that is new to us and we love it!,  This game is awesome. I had never heard of it before but while searching for board games for our family I came across this and decided to give it a try. The basic gist is that my 7 year old and I love it. It's a great challenge to be able to play against each other as YOU MOVE THE BOARD AROUND while trying to capture various items of treasure (and while trying to keep your opponent from doing so). It requires a bit of skills and thinking ahead but it's not so much that my 7 year old can't handle it.I also like that it's a relatively quick game (30 mins or so) and I like the fact that it's not a 'dumbed down' version of an older game but instead appears to be the original from Germany.If you enjoy board games that require strategy and include a fantasy aspect this is for you.,5.0
1480,B00000J0JF,RN80MV19349Q6,Pathetic quality,"  I am evaluating the product itself, not the game, which is great. This a low quality product, Ravensburger squeezed costs as much as possible maybe thinking no one would notice. The cards are of the thinnest possible paper. Horrible quality, they are not cards, just pieces of paper. But this is not the worst... The board, which is the most important element of the game, is awful. It does not stay flat, and therefore one cannot push the tiles properly. Since pushing the tiles is the most important action in the game I conclude Ravensburger was just careless, showing no respect for consumers. Please don't buy this game, try to find an older version online.",1.0
1481,B00000J0JF,RNCG00MSFB09B,FANTASTIC PURCHASE!,  I bought this game based 100% on the reviews and I couldn't be more pleased!!! This is a fantastic game!! It was a Hanukkah present for my 8 year old daughter but her big brother (11) and little brother (5) both were able to and enjoyed playing it with her. I could not wait to play it the next morning too!I especially appreciate that it does not require any reading as she is still not a confident reader and little brother is not reading yet either. It is a great logic game and I would recommend it to just about anything. I am planning on purchasing a few more copies to keep on hand for their friends birthdays.,5.0
1482,B00000J0JF,R1680IFAFQWL4O,Fun but cheap looking.,"  Very fun game with 4 players. Can either be fast paced or very slow paced due to everyone over strategizing. You think you have a strategy until three turns later and the whole Labyrinth is completely new. We played it as a buffer before monopoly and it went a lot longer than expected. About 40 minutes in total.4-1/2 - 5 stars for gameplay, 4 stars due to the look of the game. It honestly looks cheap and the color scheme is weird. Why is the background blue in a maze? The cards have a cheap/old look to them and it just looks low quality. But if that doesn't bother you, then it's a fun one and done game. Will be a while before it's back in rotation with us. I feel like it's one of those games that just sits on the shelf for a long time and only comes out when we are burned out of our regular game night games.*Also the instructions are wrong and contradicts itself, states 4 playing pieces included and then tells you the players choose one of the 6 playing pieces insinuating 6 players lol.I've attached 3 photos, two showing how the instructions are wrong. Good thing it didn't cost too much or I would be highly disappointed.",4.0
1483,B00000J0JF,R3PGG4HRMRL29S,OK version of the game,"  I have always liked this game but in this version the images on the board are not easy to see...they could have used pictures of objects in the series, as well as people...the playing pieces could have made with more imagination, instead of being plain...the board doesn't seem as sturdy...for a huge  Harry Potter fan this was a disappointment",3.0
1484,B00000J0JF,R1IBKFKP47TQVD,Fun Game. Easy to play.,"  Product is well made. Game is easy to set up and play, but a bit harder to win.

One of the best Harry Potter themed games out there and I have tried many.",5.0
1485,B00000J0JF,RK2XYHGAWKFJL,"A fun game, and a very cool concept","  This game is a lot of fun, the kids love it and so do us adults. The board is made of a maze of sliding tiles, all marked with a path that may or may not connect with the path next to it. The goal is: you slide the remaining tile (there's one extra for moving the board)  each turn, then try to move your piece and collect the items that are scattered throughout the baord. This is more difficult than it sounds, as the board moves constantly, and an easy path might be very different by the time it gets back to your turn. I guess it's hard to explain without showing, but if you look at a game play video you'll get it.The game is fun and we've played a few times. The only downside is this is one of those games where you can easily spend more effort trying to mess up your opponents than trying to win. Especially if you're a little brother and your goal is messing with your sister. Sigh...",4.0
1486,B00000J0JF,R3L0P98FDT0HBF,Great for kids or adults.,"  My wife and I play this all the time with friends. It is only 2-4 players so it isn't fit for a party game or large gathering. But it is a great game to play while having conversations as it doesn't matter what the other players are doing while it is not your turn, as after each turn the board is different and whatever strategy you came up with will no longer work. It is usually a quick game so it isn't a huge time commitment. You can make it just fun or competitive. Great for kids too as it is really easy to get the hang of after watching just one or two turns.",5.0
1487,B00000J0JF,R30TB8QT982GF6,Even my video-gamers loved it,"  I played this with my 6, 9, and 11 year old video-game-obsessed children and they loved it. They asked to play again as soon as we finish. They asked again the next day too! It is a little pricey, but I also bought a cheap board game with this order which lost their attention about 5 mins in and they've never wanted to play it again. My 9 year old beat me, so adults will find this interesting and challenging too.",5.0
1488,B00000J0JF,RM59H31F07KT6,"Not really able to strategize, each turn takes too long, my family found it frustrating and boring","  We got this on sale for just under twenty bucks. Even if this is your type of game definitely don't pay more than that. While it's a nice set overall, it's just not worth more.As far as the game itself I have kids of all ages from primary school to adult. Everyone was bored with this game. It is so slow. Especially with 4 people. You can't plan ahead because everything moves for each play, and while it sounds fun and interesting at first the reality is much different. Sometimes we were waiting 15 minutes to get a turn with 4 players. We even played with teams since we had more than 4 that were interested in playing and even that didn't help speed things along because you can really only start planning your move when your turn starts.And the game isn't what I would consider hard at all. Even my primary schooler had no trouble understanding what they needed to do and how to do it. But because it's nearly impossible to get where you're going with only your one move on your turn, and the board changes considerably by the next time your turn comes around, it takes a good deal of time to try and figure out what you want to do.My kids were playing animal crossing between their turns since strategizing ahead of time was useless anyway. We played enough rounds so that everyone got a turn as a team and a turn alone if they wanted. But by the end none of my kids were interested in playing this game anymore.I really thought this was going to be a great game for the whole family small through adult, and it turned out it was just frustrating and or boring for all of us.Being stuck together for so much time during this pandemic, I had hoped this was going to be our go to family game after dinner. Sadly it's just another one to be stuck in the closet.Sadly I can not recommend this game for any ages.",3.0
1489,B00000J0JF,R1WHMZTMU0XXKD,Delightful Find!,"  ¬†My wife bought this game for the kids last Christmas based on reviews she read; I would like to pay it forward to others.At this moment, I am playing this game with my 8y and 4y old son. [See attached vid] It was their idea to play. I bring this up to help show that the game works ages as young as 4 - as long as they have some guidance and more relaxed learning curve. After many times playing and some guidance from his older brothers, the 4y can on equal par with the others, including the adults. Much depends on ability to use logic or see patterns.The really nice part is that each game is unique even though the cards and the gameplay are the same each time.I would highly recommend this game for families.",5.0

Easy to learn, although the older sibling was initially less interested in playing, she started to get into it. I think everyone enjoyed the game. However, when the labyrinth ""slides"" as part of a player's turn, the kids kept trying to hold/block the piece from being slid off the board - as it changed the path to their goal. 5yo took an early lead, and with some tips every once in awhile won the game... Sometimes the labyrinth patch pieces that ""slide"" into the game get stuck (won't slide), unless you readjust the whole board, clearing any cross-path obstructions.",5.0
1492,B00000J0JF,R3H5EVKUCQ5VKY,LOVE THIS GAME and the Kids do too!,"  I am from Germany and Ravensburger games are super popular over there. I used to love this game when I was a kid 30 years ago and was excited when I saw it for sale in the US. I am SUPER PLEASED to say, that this game is the same quality as it used to be. Many newer games are made on the cheep nowadays and it takes away the fun to play.The game play: It's simple but every time you play you'll have to find a unique way to solve the puzzle. Basically, you have to get from point A to B and the tiles on the playing field can be moved around. So every turn can either open up new paths or someone can block your patch on their turn.Ages: I play this with my 6 and 8 year old. While my 8 year old gets creative and figures it out, my 6 year old gets the idea of the game but only sees relatively simple paths. But that's good as he learns to be more of a creative problem solver. It's totally fun for adults tooHow long does each game last: It's a fun and quick family game. Each game lasts between 20-30min. Most of the times we play 2-3 games.Is it hard to learn: As for any game, there is a learning curve. But once you get the idea (which is after playing it once) you start to get creative and your mind starts turning. I'd say its confusing at first but everyone got it after one practice round",5.0

They love the game so much I just order a new one for this Christmas. The board and pieces are actually really well made high quality and even with missing pieces my kids have managed to emprovise and still play, I'm sure theyll be happy to have the complete set again.

I also have a 3 year old who tries to play with us, but he gets easily distracted or bored and comes and goes mid game. Labyrinth is a fun game that is different from the classic board games that most people grow up with. Moving the wizard through the maze and shifting the pieces is easily done. The directions for this game are extremely simple and easily allow for rule tweaking to modify the difficulty.The only real negative is that the tiles sometimes shift a little and need to be straightened out because the corners will bump each other causing the tiles to lift up.",4.0
1496,B00000J0JF,R31B6M24FJYJFA,Engaging for young and old!  Great family game!,  Bought this game for family get togethers during the 2018 holiday months!  So glad I did!  This is a fun and entertains game for the whole family!  The adults enjoyed playing just as much as the kids so the game was a super success at creating family bonding moments and much laughter!  This is definitely a keeper for some regular game nights!  There are also instructions for a less challenging game inside for younger players.  However our 7 year old was able to play fine using the adult instructions!  This game also has a great educational value as the constantly changing maze on each turn forces critical thinking skills to plan and adjust plan to reach your targeted goal within the shifting walls of the Labarinth.  I am not big on giving a 5 star review unless it is an exceptional product!  This game is most certainly a 5 star!,5.0

1499,B00000J0JF,RT8AY2TOO3E39,Fun for all ages- 5 to adult,"  We are starting to play more games that can entertain both children and adults.  We have played plenty of the classic easy ones that simply use spinners and die to determine a players' actions.  Those are OK, but this one goes beyond that and is a blast.  It requires planning, critical thinking and is never the same.  The typical version is a little difficult for my 5 year old to play without help, but they thought of everything!  They have a modified way with alternate instructions that is recommended for younger players and is perfect - it also adds a slightly competitive component to the game also where you can block your opponents easily.  Games tend to last about 15-20 minutes, which is also good to keep children's' attention (and my own).  We have played multiple times daily since getting it and I see it in our game rotation for a long time to come for either a quick game, a filler, or multiple rounds.",5.0
1500,B00000J0JF,RS9D8RD6VAXXZ,"Easy to learn, great to play with kids!","  I bought this game with the intent of playing with my 8 year old.The rules and concept were easy for him to pickup within about 10 minutes.  The ability to handicap the difficultly by allowing children to see me target cards helps a ton.  Adults only see the top card of the stack of cards they have to navigate to.  Children can see more and pick the closest!  You can easily start scaling the difficulty with how many cards they get to see.  We were playing 2 player, so it was 12 cards seen vs 1 card seen at a time.  He slaughtered me.  Next time We'll scale him back so he can only see 6 or 3, such that it's a bit more competitive.With these in place handicaps, I didn't have to limit my own abilities to compete at all, which feels great. Would highly recommend.Haven't play against adults.  I feel it would be less fun than a game like Tsuro, strictly speaking, but I imagine it's still entertaining.",5.0
1501,B00000J0JF,R3K2WGRS7J9RBU,Fun and simple game to play with the family,  This game has become the go to game we play during family game nights. When the adults want to play we pull out Xia or 7 Wonders but when the family wants to play this is the game we pull out. It is easy to learn and quick to setup. Even the younger kids would get into this game. We wouldn't play to hard on them as we would let them put the game piece back where they pulled it from (against the rules) or put it where it would help them the most rather than trying to win as parents. I anticipate that as my kids get older the going easy on them will go out the window and we will be looking out for ourselves and that is just going to make the game night more fun. Sure there may be tears but my kids have seen me cry hundreds of times already so it won't be anything new to them.,5.0

We‚Äôve been playing it non-stop for the past two days. At first his 15 year old sister and I played it and we thought it was pretty complicated and might be too advanced for him. But I think we were overthinking it and my son won more than not (he plays per the instructions for younger players and turns over all his cards). I highly recommend this game. It was huge re-play value, is interesting for a wide range for ages - young kids to adults. It gets more fun and interesting when introducing more than two players. My son is also really into mazes right now so this was right up his alley.Lastly, the quality of the game itself is very good. It‚Äôs what you‚Äôd expect from Ravensburg.",5.0
1503,B00000J0JF,R2154FD80M2QAI,Don't get lost,"  This is a fun game. Anyone can play as long as you're not a hundred years old credit age limit. Essentially the board pieces move around indicated by arrows that are on the edge of the board. You get two actions per round and they have to go in this order. One you put the extra tile on the board, essentially pushing another tile off the board that they next player will use. Your second action is to move around the board if you choose to. your goal is to go through as many little cards as you can and these little cards have pictures of either dragons or a crown or money on it and you have to find that item on the board and get to it however the board is constantly moving so you might get stuck every once in awhile. Still a pretty fun game no matter the age group.",4.0
1504,B00000J0JF,RIWFYUXBQV1G,"Easy to Learn, fun to play!","  I actually used to work for a game company and helped to review game submissions from inventors. So I've play tested A LOT of games. The best games are ones that are complex enough to hold the interest of a wide age range of players; have enough strategy that players feel they can actually take credit for a win; BUT ones that don't make your brain explode and eyes glaze over when you read the instructions and try to understand it. (there is another audience for those sort of games, but its a smaller part of the general population) In my experience, if a game can be explained easily but still allow for strategy; then its usually a winner. This game fits the criteria perfectly! Its fast to set up and explain and the rules are pretty simple. I'd say ages 8+ will get the strategy (and even if they don't, they can still easily play) , and there are modifications in the instructions for younger players. The board and game pieces are of a nice quality. Overall, its a great game to add to your collection!",5.0
1505,B00000J0JF,RTH96VENQVYMU,"Fun, simple to learn, different type of game","  This is a great game to have in your collection because it is quick to teach, good for many ages, and very unique. I found that some gamer types used to strategizing can struggle with this game because it requires a different mental skill set than most other board games. It takes a certain level of visual/spacial visualization and planning. Think Rush Hour and sliding puzzles in a board game form. It's also easy to simplify for younger kids (give them all of their tiles at once, face up and let them choose the order they try to get their treasures).I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it's not a favorite I continually return to. I like it because it's so unique and well designed but one game is enough to scratch the itch for a different type of game. It's challenging enough but honestly relies on luck at least as much as strategy. If you're in the mood for this type of game rather than a heavier strategy game it fits the need perfectly.",4.0

1537,B01JKD4HYC,R378HW97N1FPL5,Secret Hitler got me a prom date,"  For some preface here I'll give you a bit of back ground. I'm a senior in an all boys high school and I never really knew any girls in my time here. I never really focused on it, you know? Well anyway, seniors go on a retreat for three days and its all about brotherhood and stuff like that.I was having an alright time until we had free time where some kids brought a game I'd heard about from Reddit before; Secret Hitler. I had trouble getting into it but the group I was with showed me the ropes and I made a pretty good game as a fascist. Free time ends and we go back to our normal BS, everyone is still excited from the game and can't wait to play it tomorrow. Well the next day free time rolls around and we hurry to our table to play. This time we all get seriously into it, shouting expletives at each other so loud that the entire complex can hear it and all that. Eventually we have about 20 minutes left and we decide to do one more game. The cards are passed out and I'm Hitler, its my first time. I proceed to have the most fantastic match as Hitler ever witnessed, I was trusted by all the liberals and had even rooted out some fascists on purpose. Anyway, it was the final round, liberals and fascist cards were tied and an (Unbeknownst to me) undercover fascist was the president. After about five minutes of people begging the president to give me the chancellorship, we finally voted on me and I jumped up yelling ""DEUTSCHLAND"" and I had pulled off the most perfect match ever. So a few minutes later we're all sitting back in the main room and I over hear some guys saying ""we have to do this again sometime."" and me thinking they were talking about a later free time, asked if I could come along. As it turns out they were talking about back at their houses which I was in fact invited too. So the retreat ends and we all go home. Two weeks later, a guy holds the Secret Hitler game at his house, needless to say I hit it off very well with the group and become more or less of an official member of the group. A few weeks go by and a member of the group tells me he could hook me up with a prom date because I really knew no one. I agree and we text for a bit and she is very genuine and nice. We go to prom and it is one of the best nights of my life, and I'm just astounded that I'm here just because of some board game.Thank you Goat, Wolf, & Cabbage, I couldn't have done it without you.",5.0

VERY high quality)The first few times you play this with your friends you'll have a ton of fun and laugh and think its a great game. by about the 8th time you realize that the element of chance completely ruins a deduction game. The whole idea is you're supposed to figure out  who hitler is by analyzing peoples behavior (playing liberal or fascist tokens). However, about 30% of the time a player is forced to play one token or another with the rest of the table having no idea if it was by choice or not.

1541,B01JKD4HYC,R2CMR52YU83ZO3,"Fun party game,  better with extroverts.","  Really fun party game.  There are essentially 3 roles with different game play styles:If you are a liberal,  you are playing detective trying to find out who the fascist are.  You look at other players actions, probabilities and hearsay and whether you think they are lying or not.If you are a fascist,  you are conspiring with your fellow fascists while trying to convince everyone that you are a liberal. It is all about lying, deflection and infiltration.  The lies can go several layers deep.  For example,  you can vouch for another fascist and say they are liberals.  But if he gets caught,  you will be caught too.  You can vouch for a liberal and say he is a liberal to try to earn his trust. Maybe a liberal says you are a fascist,  in that case,  you want to lie your ass off and say he is the real fascist trying to pin it on you. This is my favorite role.If you are Hittler,  it is a combination of the above,  you don't know who the other fascist are. You are playing detective  while lying about who you are.No matter which role you get assigned,  it is a lot of fun.  The ones where fascist and liberals are neck to neck and everyone is confused and accusing each other are very memorable.You will inevitably make mistakes in your first game.

My first run-through was with 5 players, and though it seemed complicated at first, we all quickly realized that there was nothing tricky about the rules themselves. However, figuring out who Hitler is can be quite tricky. This is a ""werewolf"" style game, where one player is Hitler, who plays on the fascist team. The other players are either all liberals or fascists. Each side can achieve one of two win conditions to secure a victory. The fascists win by passing 6 fascist policies OR electing Hitler Chancellor after only 3 fascist policies have passed. The libs win by passing 5 liberal policies OR assassinating Hitler. Let me just say that there is a LOT of speculation flying around the table about who Hitler might be, especially since lying is encouraged in this game.This game has a print and play version available, and has a Creative Commons license, but the purchased game is beautifully made. I especially like the gold foil that is used on the game boards, and the wooden President and Chancellor office plaques. This game was funded on Kickstarter.",5.0
1544,B01JKD4HYC,R5UAQ9M4F4AQU,Best way to completely ruin your trust in friends and overthink every action until you're more confused than when you started,"  I love this game!  It's fun with any size group, but the closer you can get to the max of 10 the more involved the gameplay gets.  I play with a lot of the same people (though in different mixes depending on the night) and it never gets repetitive.Basically you have some players that are Librals and some that are Fascists.  The Liberals don't have any information, but the Fascists know who the other Fascists are, and who Hitler is.  Hitler doesn't know who the Fascists are (except in very small games).  Each round there is an election, where one person is President (this moves around the table in sequence) and they nominate a Chancellor.  If the election succeeds, the President takes 3 policy tiles then gives 2 to the Chancellor to play one and discard one.  The goal is to fill up the Liberal policy board for the Liberals to win, or for the Fascists to fill their board or get three policies in play and get Hitler elected Chancellor.At any point, you can be truthful or lie about anything.  Due to the ratio of policy cards and some special powers granted as policies are played this leads to some very interesting game play!  You will not know who to trust, and very often discussion goes many layers deep on analyzing past actions and reviewing probabilities of things occurring as stated to try to work out who might be lying.  It's hilarious!  And playing with people repeatedly adds a lot to the mix, but it's a whole different game playing with new people that makes either situation a lot of fun.

This game quickly became one of the favorites and surpassed Resistance in the secret identity category of games. Unlike Werewolf it does not require a moderator. We've played with between 5-8 players and the balance between Liberals/Fascists does fluctuate a little based on the number of players. For example, we played 2 games on New Year's Eve with 6 players in one game (4 liberals, 1 fascist and Hitler) and 7 players in the other game (4 liberals, 2 fascists and Hitler). The liberals won both times and it was very easy during the 6 player game, whereas the 7 player game was longer and seemed more balanced for the fascists.Hopefully they will release an expansion in the future to add another element to the game.

Are you good at keeping a straight face when being correctly accused of spreading fascism?  Do you want to look at one of your best friends tomorrow, certain that she must (still) be Hitler?  Are you good at cheering for freedom while secretly harboring a desire to use presidential powers to shoot that guy across from you that voted against you two turns ago?If you answered yes, or almost did, to any of the above questions, then Secret Hitler is for you.At the start of the game, all the players are divided into Liberals and Fascists, with the Liberals always having a majority, but only the Fascists start the game knowing who is who.  One of the Fascists will also be Hitler, who in larger games (7+ players) will also not know who is who.  The goal of each team is to take over the government with their ideology, with each team having two ways to win:Liberals win if they either pass 5 liberal laws (typical) or kill Hitler (rare).  Fascists win if they either pass 6 fascist laws (uncommon) or pass 3 fascist laws and also elect Hitler as Chancellor (common).However, the path to victory for either team takes cunning and sometimes a lot of lying straight-faced to the guy right next to you.  ""He gave me two fascist laws, I had no choice but to pass a fascist law!""  ""That's right, I started with three fascist laws, so I was unable to do anything about that myself.""  The deck contains 11 fascist laws and 6 liberal laws, so it's up to you to figure out if that scenario is plausible!The game requires 5 to 10 players to play; no more and no fewer, and this game is not for small children.  I personally believe the game is more balanced between the two teams when an even number of players are present; otherwise it feels like the fascist team get a slight edge due to the relatively high odds of two liberals being removed from play.

Always a riot.,"  It takes at least one game for newbies to learn what is going on and they inevitably mess up somehow, but by the second game, everyone is usually hooked and having a blast. Whenever friends and I get together to play, I always have to reexplain a couple of things as usually a bit of time passes between gatherings, but for the most part everyone remembers most of the rules and everyone remembers the concept of the game and basic game play. More than that, it's always a riot! Seriously, i'ts the Best. Game. EVER. I highly recommend for small game nights with 10 people or under. 8 people is the perfect number, but 10 is fun too. 6 people and under is fun, but not as fun. Best works with boisterous, even loud friends who stick up for themselves. Quiet introverts aren't the best fit for this game.",5.0
1555,B01JKD4HYC,R5HSLWB3CM4M,A must have game for large groups. All levels of expierence have had a blast with this game.,"  This is the most fun I‚Äôve had with a board game in a long time. It‚Äôs extremly refreshing to have a game that is this fun a larger group. The more people you have the better! I have played this game around two dozen times with 4 VERY different groups of people. One was my extremly advanced board game group, one being my buddies who only play games when I bust them out, one being my medium experienced weekly group and the last being a group of 10 that think Cards Against Humanity is the only party game worthy of playing. Every single group had an absolute BLAST playing this game. We were all yelling at each other, friendships were temporarily lost, the second a round ended everyone demanded that we start a new one, multiple people ordered the game while we were playing it. I‚Äôve played a lot of board games and I haven‚Äôt seen a game that is this entertaining and playable for all levels of board gamers. Quaterbacking games can be tricky at times, it‚Äôs hard to explain how this style of game works to people who have never played games like werewolf, mafia, Avalon (the lying through your teeth, arguing etc) but I love the look on people‚Äôs face once they figure out how to play this game. For 35$ this is a must have game for people who gather in large groups. It‚Äôs for all levels of expierence and I haven‚Äôt met a person who didn‚Äôt love this game.",5.0

We played with the minimum of 5 players and had fun but there are more elements with more people so it gets more interesting and challenging with more people.  Our family plays lots of games and this one is becoming a favorite.  I like that the rounds are short,  you can play several times in a short period of time and set up is easy.",5.0
1557,B01JKD4HYC,R1EK38O3ARGBIU,"Recommend for people who like ultimate werewolf, mafia, or Salem",  If you ignore the main part ‚Äúthe title‚Äù this boils down to a game of deduction. It is a good game for large groups. You‚Äôll always get that person whose accusing everyone in the group. Someone whose on the fence about voting and whether or not the person was lying about the cards they drew. The game itself has big replayability due to the changing of roles and the ability to have large groups play. Use deduction skills and facials tales to figure out who the enemy is. The product itself has a nice box with thick cardboard. The pieces and cards themselves are also of good quality.,5.0

1561,B01JKD4HYC,R78UO65729I8V,New favorite for game night,"  I love this game. It's bonkers in the best way. Similar gameplay to Avalon (good vs. evil, secret identities, voting, backstabbing, manipulation). You can tell there was a ton of thought put into the details of the box, cards, gameboards, directions, etc. The theme is flawlessly carried out throughout the directions, gameplay, and pieces.I recommend playing with more people. I have played with as little as 5 people and up to 10 people. 10 people is def more fun, but I had fun with 5 people (esp because we were all so into it). With 10 people, it's really hard to judge who is good and evil and you find you only get around the group about 1-1.5 times before the game ends. Def adds complexity and unknowns. I also like being evil more than good (F vs. L) because it's psychologically harder - you have to lie and it's more ambiguous how you should play the round. Being the head honcho (Adolf) is also very fun, but a good Adolf will probably mean you are passive and lowkey the whole game.Highly recommended as a party game to those people not easily offended by the topic. Also some people are not comfortable with games where you opening lie and manipulate. It's all in good fun. It stretches some EQ muscles we might not use in normal interactions with true telling people.",5.0
1562,B01JKD4HYC,RKNUBYLR90CPJ,Most Beautiful and High-Quality Game Materials I have Ever Seen!,"  You almost never see this level of quality in modern games, especially at this price point. WOOD plaques for President and Chancellor!?! FOIL inlays on the sturdy game boards!?! The policy markers are thick tokens instead of cards!?! Even the rule booklet is the full length of the box, and printed on glossy heavy-stock paper. You will be amazed even before you begin playing. This is our favorite social deduction game BY FAR. Terrific game play and great opportuinties to deceive your opponents. The goal for the fascists is to get Hitler elected Chancellor. This means that Hitler must be ABOVE SUSPICION. After all, he (or she) has to get all the Liberal players to vote for him! It is so fun to pass liberal policies as Hitler and maneuver the liberals into not only NOT suspecting you, but actually advocating for you as being ""definitely"" on their side! It's hard to explain the total adrenaline rush when the secret Hitler has been nominated for Chancellor, and the votes are being cast... This is the most fun you can have at social deduction!",5.0
1563,B01JKD4HYC,R13MUXW5ZSQT3O,"Do yourself a favor, buy this.","  Arguably the best party game I've played. This is a social deduction game that plays up to 12. Each player will receive the role of a Liberal or a Fascist. However, one player will receive the role of Hitler, who is also part of the Fascist team.....makes sense. Hitler does not know who his Fascist comrades are, but the other Fascist know which player has the Hitler role. Meanwhile, the Liberals are all left in the dark and have to figure it out as the game goes. The goal of the game is for the Liberals to either assassinate Hitler, or get more policies voted in than the Fascists. The Fascists win if Hitler becomes elected Chancellor, or if they have more policies voted in over the Liberals. Each round, the next player, in clockwise rotation, runs for president, they choose who they'd like as their chancellor running-mate. The players will vote on this tandem to be okay or not okay. If voted okay, these two players receive 3 face-down policies, which will be labeled fascist or liberal. The policies don't do anything, they're just labeled. The president will secretly eliminate one policy, then the chancellor secretly chooses which one will be voted in from the remaining 2. This repeats each round until on of the win conditions in met. This game is so much fun. The first time our group got it to the table, it was played probably 7 times consecutively. There was shouting, controversy, couples arguing, laughs, shifty eyes, and paranoia. By the end of the game you assume no one is trustworthy! I like to think there's two types of tension in gaming, good and bad. This game brings out the good, and it brings out a lot of it! It's created plenty of inside joking to the point where our group is claiming another player being a fascist during a completely different game. I can't recommend it enough. Easy to learn. The rule book is straight forward. The only recommendation I have is to play with 7+ players. That's a tall order because it's not always easy to get that many together, but there are a couple of extra abilities given to the liberal players as more fascists policies come in. Those abilities are reduced when playing with fewer. The game shines with more, which is a rare thing to say, but trust me here. If you have the opportunity of 7+ players, this game will do the trick!",5.0

1565,B01JKD4HYC,R24LMKXQ2QM3VD,One of the greatest games I've played,"  This game is a RIOT.It takes a playthrough for most people to get whats going on, but after that, this game is amazing.I will say this, its better with the more people you have. We dont play it with anything less than 9 or ten people. So you DO have to have a decent sized group to get the most out of it. But man if you can take it to a family gathering around a holiday and get a full game going, its just incredible to watch what unfolds.Things do get a little heated, but its all in fun, and hilarious. If someone in your family is way too competitive this could potentially end up in divorce hearings. The game involves deceit and lying and some people in our family have been a little put off to discover their significant others are a lot better at lying to their faces than they imagined...Favorite game to date, have a set group we try to get together to play this all the time.",5.0
1566,B01JKD4HYC,R29HRZ4SMEG4OP,Don't let the name push you away...,"  If you've ever played Resistance or a similar game, you will love this game. Even if you haven't played a game where deceit and outright lying are principal strategies, you should check out this game.It's slightly harder than Resistance to learn, but that quickly goes away. In this game, the liberals are not necessarily trying to beat the fascists, and vice versa: the liberals are trying to prevent Hitler from becoming Chancellor (2nd in charge) after so many rounds have elapsed.This makes the game more entertaining on two levels: first, it adds a whole new layer of strategy. Fascists may sell their friend up the river, openly, because they don't need his vote...they only need to take the heat off the person secretly holding the Hitler card. Unlike Resistance, this game will force some folks to show their allegiance...though not their identity as Hitler.Second, this game is genuinely fun from a historical perspective. Its construction is eerily accurate to post-WWI Germany, and anyone who may know the history will at least once find themselves saying, ""oh no, this is JUST HOW IT REALLY HAPPENED!"" So not only is this game genuinely fun, and genuinely historical...it is also educational, in an indirect sort of way. There's that old Benjamin Franklin quote, ""those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety,"" and if it were possible for a game to teach that idea, then this game does it. Highly recommended for anyone to buy and play!",5.0

Depending on how risk taking the players are, the game can go anywhere from 30-45 minutes to 1-1.5 hours.

1584,B0003MA0PK,R2YVLYG3O5K6PD,Spy Alley Review by Dad's Gaming Addiction,"  Spy Alley: 2-6 Players, Ages 8+, Average Play Time = 45 MinutesSpy Alley reminds me a bit of Clue and Monopoly...the former because you're trying to use deductive logic to find hidden identities and the latter because you're moving around the board buying and collecting things.  However, the bluffing mechanic adds a nice twist to the game and rightly sets itself apart from both.Speaking of which, the bluffing mechanic adds a bit of strategic flair to the game.  Some players might opt to take a slow approach in gathering their country's items while others might take a more direct approach and only buy an unnecessary item here or there.  Players can also choose which countries to buy items for (in most cases), so some may buy items for all six countries while others might buy items for only two or three countries.  It all comes down to how quick you can obtain your country's items without giving yourself away, and that will change with each person you play against.  You might be able to get away with more when playing against a child, for example, but you better have your poker face ready for someone who's played five-card stud professionally and is watching your facial expressions like a hawk.From a parent's point of view, Spy Alley is definitely kid friendly.  In fact, it's simple enough to where it would appeal to people of all ages.  Being at the mercy of bad die rolls can be frustrating at times, though the move cards and confiscate materials space (among other things) helps players to offset that.  All in all, it is a fun, casual game that is definitely worth looking into.",4.0

1627,B013TJ5P80,RRO32LS14E6JE,A review for those playing with two people.,"  This review is written specifically for those playing as a 2 player game. Mysterium is a beautiful clue giving and partner solving game where your partner will play the part of two psychics trying to figure out the who, where and how (what object) a crime was committed. To add difficulty in a 2 player game your partner plays the part of two psychics versus the usual one. The person playing the ghost will give the psychics clues in the form of surreal picture cards. From those cards the psychic tries to figure out who the ghost is pointing to, where, and finally what object was used to commit the crime. If you make it to the end stage you have narrowed it down to two suspects each with their own location and weapon. The ghost then gives three cards to her partner and from there must guess which is the correct suspect. As a two player game Mysterium is enjoyable but if you play just a few rounds you and your partner will become familiar with certain cards associated with certain suspects/locations/weapons. Once you have tuned in to each other you will have established a visual shorthand. There is an expansion set with some additional cards which will be helpful in keeping the game fresh, but I suspect more expansions will be needed to keep the game going. The game is still fun for two players but the sweet spot seems to be with four psychics and one ghost. There are are more minds at play, and the clairvoyance track comes into play which adds another dimension of fun and difficulty and the end stage. You don't use the clairvoyance track with just two people. Overall I enjoyed this as a two player game, but I have already ordered the expansion set and since there aren't many cards in the expansion, I'm hoping more are released. Recommended for two players, but expect limited replay once both people become familiar with the cards.",4.0
1628,B013TJ5P80,R1AE16B572ET6D,"Love the game, instructions could use work","  We love this game! We've played it 8 times since getting it. Which is enough times for each person to play the ghost once/twice and we love it! It's definitely in our board game playing rotation now.Style of game:- A more adult, more fun. more challenging version of Clue.- Co-opPositives:- Great theme, we even dimmed the lights to set the mood- Good, quality components.- Beautiful artwork- Fun to play for both sides of the table. Sometimes when games have 1 person that plays as something different than the others, once side ends up not having as much fun. That isn't the case with this game.- Age rating seems pretty close. We played with a 12 year old and sit was good for her, challenging but fun. She even asked to play it again the 2nd night. She did have a little more fun and easier time at the ghost, but I think everyone will feel that way.- Game play is pretty easy to understand, once you make it through the instructions.Negatives:- Instructions could be easier to follow. It took a while to learn because of that. We watched a video though, I'd recommend that.- The screen for the ghost is a little too tall so it makes it hard to look over and see the rest of the cards on the table.- Good replay value if you play with different people every 5 or so times. If it's the same group of people I could see this becoming slightly repetitive.Personal notes:- I wouldn't play this with someone you have never met or don't know being the ghost. It relies a lot on people's interpretations of the cards and if you have no concept of the thought process of the person playing ghost it could become frustrating, very fast.- New players should play as ghost first. For us, it seemed to go a lot better that way.",4.0
1629,B013TJ5P80,R31S5N31MX3116,Probably the most awkwardly designed board game I've ever played,"  This had been recommended to me and it seemed like something my family would enjoy so I waited until it was on sale. I'm really glad I did because at full price I would have felt ripped off. The setup for this game takes forever. Cards have to be matched with other cards multiple times (according to the numbers on the backs) and the layout is really big and confusing which makes it hard to see certain things depending on where you're sitting. We weren't able to attach the hand to our clock, the plastic pieces wouldn't clip together no matter how many people tried. And the cards themselves are quite dark. The company recommends playing with some mood lighting on but I have no idea how you would see anything at all considering we had a hard time even in a brightly lit room. And the rules are so awkwardly written, you would be better off watching an instruction video. We've played three times and had to have the rules nearby because what happens at the end is rather convoluted but could be easily simplified. When the rules told us to do something, we all kept asking ""Why? Wouldn't it be simpler and better if...?"" over and over.The game is super, super easy. Our 5 year old won the first game we played all by himself with no help. Our 8 year old was the ghost in our second game and we never made a wrong choice. It has the air of complexity but it's even easier than Clue. I know a lot of reviews have stated that the vision cards are too vague but we haven't had that problem at all. And we discovered a flaw that guarantees a win which took the fun completely out of it and now there's no reason to ever play it again. This seriously needed to be playtested many more times before release to make it worth playing more than a few times. It very much feels like a first draft of the game rather than a finished, polished product.I really wanted to like this but you would be better off playing any other number of games with this theme.",1.0
1630,B013TJ5P80,R3II9CINAN9VK6,"Fun game, great artwork, quality components!","  This game is really fun! I have only played twice, first a 3 player game, then a 7 player one, and I was the ghost both times. It was definitely hard keeping a straight face when my friends were trying to figure out what the heck I was trying to tell them with my card choices! It did take a couple hours with the 7 of us, but 5 had never played this game (and some had never played anything other than Monopoly etc.), and the 3 player was over an hour, though part of that was reading/learning the rules. I look forward to playing as a psychic trying to interpret the ghost's clues, and while I have read that some people have played so often (presumably with the same people) that the cards are getting stale/predictable, there is an expansion that looks good (and you can probably supplement with Dixit cards too). The artwork is awesome and the components are good quality - I especially like the board the ghost uses. Fun game, definitely recommend",5.0
1631,B013TJ5P80,R1V5AO34XG069S,Zoinks,"  This is one of the better examples of a party game done just right, I think. The game is extraordinarily simple, and easy to teach. One player is a ghost; the others are mediums trying to find out the circumstances of that ghost's murder. The ghost is unable to communicate in anything other than abstract images that are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. It's the ghost's job to figure out how to use those images to communicate either the person, place, or thing that the medium is currently searching for.Each medium, initially, has their own miniature mystery to solve, going through three steps starting with the person. At the end of the game, all of this information is combined together into a final guessing round as to which investigator's combination is the correct one - a thing that's randomly chosen by the ghost, and again communicated to the group using the Vision cards available.For a party game, this can actually be quite difficult. The Vision cards are often VERY abstract, and it will require some knowledge of how the players think to try to get them pointed in the right direction. You are all playing cooperatively, and while the investigators can freely talk among themselves about what they've seen, the ghost is required to keep silent, and not provide any tells. It makes for an extremely fun experience, but one that is definitely best in groups. It can be played two-player, but there different ways people interpret cards make it far better with more, and allow the ghost a little bit more room to use their cards with the expectation that the mediums can all help each other with their respective investigations.The components are decently made. The ghost's screen is a stand-out here, with each investigator having their own column with little pockets for the ghost to place cards. The pockets are a bit tight, making it hard to sometimes place and remove cards until they're broken in, but they feel quite sturdy. The little player pieces are made out of plastic and are a bit cheaply cast, but they get the job done. The timer is a clock made out of a few pieces of cardboard that you actually put together to stand free. Beyond that, everything else is either cards or thick cardboard chits.If you have a group that likes to do a bit of logical deduction mixed with some abstract thinking, this is a fantastic game. It's probably not something that holds up to multiple games in rapid succession, but as something to throw in the middle of a night, or just for giggles, it can make for some funny stories.",4.0
1632,B013TJ5P80,R3U05MAY5OTLJU,Amazing game!,"  Mysterium is an amazing game where all players work together to solve a crime.There is one player who plays as the ghost that attempts to tell other players (psychics) information about the crime using cards with artwork on them.The artwork is amazing and beautiful, and the gameplay is easy to grasp and interesting.I've found that this game isn't for everyone though. There are players who prefer more concrete gameplay and dislike the notion of having to ""interpret"" what a card given by the ghost could mean.",4.0
1633,B013TJ5P80,RIZXS1I5LT8PZ,"Somewhat like Clue, but a team atmosphere and a lot more fun!","  I'll start by saying I love Clue.Especially for what it is: an easy to learn game of deduction. When I heard about this game people said it was just a little like Clue, but a lot more to it. That's all true, but still an easy game to pick up.Can be played with 2-7 people (we've only played with 3 so far, but really looking forward to more people!). All of the players except one play the role of psychics who try to figure out the clues given by the other play, who plays the ghost. The first round, each player is trying to decipher the clues given by the ghost to figure out which suspect they're supposed to guess (each player will try to identify a different suspect). This gets repeated with locations, then weapons (just like Clue right?). The ""clues"" that the ghost gives out to each player are vision cards: abstract pictures that could be interpreted in many different ways. The ghost tries to give out these vision cards to each player based on which suspect on the board they're trying to guess, as each suspect/location/weapon card have extra things on them telling you about the location. While this is going on, each round other players can ""bid"" on whether a player correctly guessed their card. Bidding correctly gives them extra ""points"" which will give more clues for the end of the game.Players have a limited number of rounds to have all players guess their 3 cards (suspect/weapon/location). If all players guess correctly, then you work together to find out who the actual killer/location/weapon is used. The sets of three and put out and given a number (1-6, depending on how many players are in the game). The ghost secretly picks one of the sets and puts the number token for that set face down in front of everyone.  Then the ghost picks out 3 more vision cards: one representing the suspect, one the location, and one the weapon of the set chosen. Depending on how well players bid during the game, they get to look at one, two, or all 3 cards before they vote on who they think the right set is.  Most votes is what the group goes with, and hopefully is the correct answer.For people who don't like to think outside the box when it comes to clues may not enjoy this game. Right now I've only played it with my wife and 9 year old and they both dig the game, and helping to teach my son to think more outside the box on some things to find connections and be observant (note on the 2-3 player games, no bidding happens, there's always 4 psychics so players will play multiple people, and all 3 clues are revealed to everyone at the end). Really can't wait to play with 7 people to see how that goes, but recommend this to be added to the game shelf.",5.0
1634,B013TJ5P80,R2SIKWNFS7W42B,Perfect gateway game and spookily thematic,"  Mysterium is a cooperative game where you're trying to receive clues from the recently deceased player acting as a helping ghost. Each player is assigned a person, location, and weapon. Through the ghost's visual clues, each player is attempting to decide which person, location, and weapon was assigned to them. Players are encouraged to discuss the clues with one another to form conclusions. The ghost cannot speak at all, however. If the group can't get each player to guess their assigned cards before the clock strikes the final round, everyone loses. The theme in this game is awesome. Halloween, rainy day, nighttime - any of these are a perfect setting. It plays up to 7, and it works. Be aware that any player playing as the ghost has the hardest job so it's recommended that first time players should avoid that role if possible, especially with higher player counts. I can't recommend the game for 2 or 3, it's just not that fun. 4-7 players is great though. It's thematic, cooperative, and easy to play. Winning isn't always the easiest in this game, but it keeps you coming back for more. Also, kids can easily play this too. No reading is necessary and it's not a horror-themed game, don't be fooled by the box art. No gore in the art. The only thing I'll say is to avoid learning from the rule book. It took us way too long to learn and setup for our first play. It's extremely wordy. Just go to Board Game Geek or Youtube for a tutorial. It'll save you time and it's easier.",5.0
1635,B013TJ5P80,RVS4D3DCYZPGM,"Very good, very enjoyable game","  Mysterium is easy to learn and fun to play.  It is less strategy-based than a lot of the games I usually play.  I would say it is geared more to creative, artistic people than others who prefer games of strategy and/or luck.I can describe it as a combination of Forbidden Island, Clue, and Code Names.  In Clue, you must identify the murderer, the location, and the weapon.  You have to do the same in Mysterium.  One player plays as the ghost who was murdered.  The other players serve as psychics trying to figure out what happened (how the ghost died and by whose hand).  The ghost sends visions (picture clues) to each player.  The players must try to use those visions to guess which suspect, location, and weapon the ghost is referring to.  It's like Code Names...but instead of word association, this is image association.  This is a cooperative game.  Players can work together to try to decipher the ghost's visions.  At the end of the game, everyone wins or everyone loses (including the ghost).  So in that respect, it's like Forbidden Island.Definitely a fun game and worth playing.",4.0
1636,B013TJ5P80,R3GTX31NWTM0K1,You need the right people to really enjoy this game,"  I would like to start by saying that I really enjoyed this game, however, you need to right set if people to play with. Thematically, it is similar to clue in the each person is trying to identify their person, place, and weapon, but that is where the similarities end. Whereas in clue you have a very methodical way of determining the right set, in this game you are trying to guess you person, place, or weapon based on ""visions."" These visions are cards that the ghost (kind of the game leader/clue giver) provides you with. They are highly abstract pictures that often will relate to what you are supposed to guess in a very vague way. This would be harder to play with a group of people house didnt know or younger children. Additionally, you really need to be able to think outside the box because the clues are very rarely obvious at first sight. That being said, once one person understands how to play and can be the ghost, anyone can join in, because the job of the guesser is quite simple.",5.0

The ghost will hand out clues to each player from which you must make a choice about the murderer, location, and weapon. The ghost player has to decide on the clues (which are random picture cards) that best matches with the set of info for each individual player. It is really fun to see what kind of associations and the thought process of everyone involved in this game.I've only played a very simplified version of the game, but there are different ""difficulty"" levels for the game itself which is really nice for replay value.",5.0

1639,B013TJ5P80,R1HSB169S0HKJR,Very enjoyable game for a theme night with multiple players,"  Bought this as a gift for a friend who is the head of our gaming group. We've played this a couple of times already and we all absolutely love it. The theme is easily immersible if you're into anything involving mystery, ghosts, seances, or random spookiness. The game play itself turned out to feel like a mixture between Clue, Dixit, and something entirely new to me. I loved the interaction between the ghost and the psychics. The game was full of non-verbal communication and very abstract artistic messages, which we somehow managed to grasp right from the very first game. The ghost is not supposed to speak at all, and can only provide hints and answers by knocking on the table - once for yes or twice for no. This was one of those games that helped us all learn a bit more about how each of the other gamers think around the table. If you have a ghost who is an established gamer and will not be overly stressed at having to guide everyone else in the room, this can be a very simple and rewarding experience for the psychic players. This game will be hitting our table pretty often, but I would recommend playing it with a larger group of players.",5.0

I've played this a dozen times and I didn't notice that the chair has a lion head emblem on the back!""Is the ghost showing you a picture of a knight chopping down a tower with a sword because they want to tell you the murder weapon is a sharp thing? Or a metal thing? or the candelabra because the tower is shaped like a candle?We've been playing this game at work and it's become our favorite team building exercise.

1642,B013TJ5P80,R1WT7W9DUOSW5B,Boring,"  The contents of the box are pretty good, the artwork is nice and well thought out. The layout, unfortunately, is where the problems start. This game requires way too much play space if you follow the guidelines of the instructions. More than games like Betrayal House on the Hill.The gameplay itself is abstract where the ghost/spirit/random dead player is trying to get the players to use their psychic abilities to decern the when, where, and how of how that ghost was killed with vague clues that are limited to randomly drawn cards with pictures. The concept is great, but the mechanics of this abstract thought game ruin the fun almost immediately.If you want a frustrating almost senseless (not in the funny way) board game experience, get Mysterium.

Everyone wins or loses together.-Great for large groups, we had exactly 7 people and this was the game we played every night.-Well constructed game.Cons:-Ghost character does not get to participate in as much of the side chatter throughout the game.-Clipping together the clock was actually really difficult for us.

Over the course of a week, we played the game multiple times; it's just that good.This is a great game where everyone is working together to solve a crime.  There's a playlist online of eerie music that we had to play in the background and we added some sound effects as well.  We pretty much ended up playing this game every evening long into the early hours; laughing constantly.I loved this game so much that I ordered my own copy and both expansion packs!

We ended up trying it out with a few friends one night and went through a couple rounds in about under 2ish hours (factoring in the time it takes to set up and read/learn the rules and become familiar enough to play) It was a straightforward and rather simple game, with a few hair pulling/hysterical moments thrown in. I especially loved the character that isn't allowed to speak a single word during the whole game, as my friends did as well, since I was that person, and I ""talk too much"".Either way, it's one of the quicker board games to play, but still has a little length to play. Would recommend definitely.",5.0
1646,B013TJ5P80,R2HO846OGBOIH9,Dixit meets Clue,"  We've been under quarantine from the coronavirus for a few days, so this game came at the most opportune time. I do recommend this game be played with someone who has already played it acting as the ""ghost."" The game is not difficult to learn but the wording on the instructions can be a bit hard to descipher at times. The box was designed very well and there is a place for almost every game piece. No need for little bags to help organize the pieces. It helps to organize the cards back into numerical order at the end of each game to make the next game easier to start.BackgroundThe premise of the game is that a murder took place a long time ago and you are a group of psychics who have come to do a seance. You summon a ghost who can only speak to you in pictures and you have 7 rounds to investigate different suspects. Each suspect will lead you to a person, a location, and a weapon. If you correctly guess all the suspects within the 7 ""hours"" of the seance, the ghost will provide you with the final clues as to who the actual killer is.GameplayThis is pretty smooth and easy to understand/explain when playing as a psychic. The ghost is the one doing all the work and has to sit behind a screen. Have your strongest player be the ghost for the first round to hash it out. The game takes about 40 minutes and was easy for even beginner boardgame players to figure out how to play. When playing as 2 or 3 player games, check the very last page for instructions as to how many psychics for each player to play with.",5.0
1647,B013TJ5P80,R36XA4MU16IA84,Top game: surreal and mindbending - theatrical and immersive!,"  Impressive coop game, really cool for a family game night! So, you're a ghost who communicates visions to ""psychic mediums"" using vision cards, and they have to determine who killed you, where you were killed, and with what weapon. Very ""Clue-like"", but so much cooler! To knock the experience out of the park, take 2 or 3 smart phones and stream the Mysterium music (or whatever epic music you like) for the game. The fact that they'll be playing slightly out of synch around you makes the experience that much more immersive!But back to the game. The designers put a lot into the artwork which is really surreal - definitely a high quality game. The vision cards are very dream-like. Each vision card has multiple elements so be careful not to mislead the psychics!The way it's set up you can really get into it and jazz up the experience to any theatrical degree.Definitely recommend!",5.0
1648,B013TJ5P80,R25CUKQRS7YA7X,A great marriage of theme and rules!,"  After waiting a few months for this game, I've finally managed to play it three times in two weeks. I've played it with serious gamers, my wife and our mothers, and with teens. Each group had a good time.I won't summarize the rules, because that's easy enough to find elsewhere (like from the publisher's site):http://en.libellud.com/index.php?option=com_zoo&task=callelement&format=raw&item_id=1523&element=66b58ffc-c789-4cef-b9f1-2cb5226ebace&method=download&args[0]=4ba51578946c33ff9c21a9f248c5214f&Itemid=57What I will comment on is that this game really shines in one spectacular way: the mechanism (symbol matching), matches the story (the players are psychics, trying to communicate with a ghost). You see, the ghost player is forced to communicate with a limited number of images, and the players, well, they almost have to be psychic to figure out what the ghost is trying to say!Why does my review score it with 4 stars? If you examine the theme too closely, it kind of falls apart. During the game, each player is solving a different mystery, but the ghost is only interested on one; his own death. This is easily fixed by saying that the ghost is confused, and needs help remembering from the psychics/players.Another problem is with gaining clairvoyant points which help with the end game. In a large game, it is VERY difficult to get enough of them. You might want to follow the rules for 3-5 players if you are playing with a larger group.Don't let my quibbles deter you. This is a very good game, and I'm glad to have it in my collection.",4.0

My 9 y/o loves this game and somehow always inserts himself into our adult game gatherings. He's also one of the best players because he tends not to overthink the clues...the simple mind of a child!I originally bought this for my wife who loves the classic game ""Clue"" because I knew she would love this game, but now I've hijacked it and have played it more than her.

Strongly recommend reading all the instructions before you get people together to play the game, otherwise excitement may flag while you dish out all the pieces and explain the rules. Game plays a bit like Clue: Museum Caper mixed with Dixit. Each player is trying to guess which spirit is speaking to them, who killed them, and what they were killed with.

Even my mother and friends who have never played boardgames could easily learn and play at the first time. It's very simple but also entertaining. The most dificult part is to be the ghost, so you better let someone who has already played be the Ghost if it's your first time. Even who doesnt really like Dix It (wich is a similar game), likes Mysterium a lot. They say Mysterium is a Dix It with a purpose, and prefer this game for this reason...because they feel there's a point to play it, cause you have a main goal.The only thing is that some cards (just a few) may be easily connected to the other. Like the Magician (suspect card) can be easily related to a  vision card that is full of rabbits. Maybe this happened to me because I played a lot of times with same persons. I played it a lot since I bought and I felt like buying the expansion already.And.... : if you know the Dix It mechanism of playing,you have meeples and a pointing board you might even play Dix It just with Mysterium cards!",4.0

(It might also help that we watched Wil Wheaton's Tabletop run-through on YouTube.) It's similar to Clue, except you don't talk back and forth or write anything down. There's been a murder, and one player plays as the Ghost, who is trying to give picture clues to the clairvoyant/psychic guests(the other players) to determine WHO killed you, in what ROOM, and with what OBJECT. As one of the psychics, you're trying to guess who/where/what by (hopefully) picking up on the right details in the clue cards the Ghost gives you each round. This is a team game; the psychics all vote on which who/where/what scenario (of 3) they think is the right one, and if they all get it right, they win. If they don't all guess the same way, they lose and the ghost remains unavenged.",5.0

The players are generally bored waiting for the visions to be chosen, and the ghost can get frustrated with the small sample of vision cards available (can get stuck with useless cards for a long time).  With some modifications, we've made this a fun game to play.  No reading required so good for younger players as well.",4.0
1654,B013TJ5P80,R3YHIL46D3EP0,Fun game,"  The artwork and detail is just wonderful in this game. To keep track of turns in the games, rather than doing just a timer or checkbox, they actually have a tiny clock that you put together, and player tokens are tiny crystal balls. The ghost can also ""dump"" cards and marks the times they do so with little tokens in the shape of ravens, and each raven is different. Just wonderful detail and spooky atmosphere.The gameplay is solid. It's like a supernatural mix of Dixit and Clue. We already have played this several times since getting it, and it's become a real winner. Much easier to learn than, say Arkham Horror, but still very fun.We haven't gotten to the point that it's been a problem, but the only potential problem is replay value.

Gameplay is fun, although I had 1 player in 1 of my 3 groups describe it as ""a bit slow"". The theme worked well. It's important that people who have not played the Ghost before understand how sometimes the Ghost's hands are tied and they just don't have great cards to play for a particular player; we had a couple times where players eviscerated the Ghost for handing out confusing clues, but they didn't understand that the Ghost was caught in a bad situation and only had 1 or no Crows left for the entire game; again, not a problem if players understand up front. Replayability is moderate, each game is more or less like the last, and even though the deck is huge you do start seeing the same cards popping up pretty regularly (the expansion helps with this), but you can adjust difficulty for added difficulty.",4.0

The ghosts job is to send visions to the psychics, who then have to pick a person, place, and murder weapon from the clues in the vision. The best part is that this game is cooperative, so your ultra competitive friend who likes to hide monopoly money in her pockets doesn't gloat for a week when she wins. That's right, Sandra, I'm calling you out.A few things to know before you buy:-Learning this game can take some time. It is a lot to setup, and there are a lot of rules to be aware of. It includes instructions, obviously, but I also recommend finding a Youtube video online describing how to play. There is also a mobile app version of this game that holds your hand as you learn; it costs a few dollars but you get to play Mysterium on the go! Worth it!-This game takes up space. A lot of space. Be prepared.-Putting everything back in the box isn't as straightforward as you would thing. Pay attention to what goes where, you'll thank me later.",5.0

The tightness of the string is very tight and if you pull back to far it launches the puck, we've had some fly off the board. But as long as you keep it half pulled when playing they stay in the board and is fun. No where on the board to store pucks. Which would be great if there was. Since the box is cardboard and eventually start tearing and such like all seem to do. But the game itself is a good smaller version! We like it",5.0

Rules are easy enough to pick up and play with little difficulty. we didnt understand how corruption worked on the first play as it seemed way to easy to win, so we immediately double checked and holy hell is it a kick in the pants and way more fun when you do that properly.Only downside is that my copy was missing pieces. I ended up short 1 generic deadite bad guy, and i was somehow given 2 of the ‚Äúgood ash‚Äù figures (missing the ‚Äúevil ash‚Äù in case a player is turned into a deadite)Also, the player pieces seem highly susceptible to defects as many arrived bent. I know its common, but oddly it only seemed to affect the player pieces and none of the deadites (this held true even while comparing my replacement) . im told its easy to ‚Äúadjust‚Äù these types of flaws if you use a heat gun or hair dryer to warm the plastic before setting them in the proper position to prevent breakage, but do so at your own risk.We got a replacement for the missing pieces so were all set at 100% and cant wait to play again!",5.0

1725,1947494503,RX8LROZCOUY0L,The best board game of all time,"  This is the best board game I have ever played.  Okay, it helps that I love Dune (the book and the 1984 movie).  But the mechanics of the game is just genius.  They found a brilliant way to incorporate the sand worm, spice, weather storms, poison, poison snooper, lasgun (which, if played against a shield acts like an atomic explosion), family atomics, and characters/factions into how the game plays, which makes it an absolute thrill for those of us familiar with the story (especially if familiar with the book) but also quite fun for those who are not.  I highly recommend reading the book in and of itself, and you will see for yourself how it all ties in together.  If the book is too much, just watch the 1984 movie (not the horrible ""SyFy"" series re-make, which is an abomination with terrible acting).There is an incredible balance between the factions that shows it must have been painstakingly tested.  The Harkonnen initially seemed like they were way too powerful (they get 4x as many traitors and 2x as many treachery cards, making them a nasty faction to fight with) and the Emperor seemed too rich, but as I've tried out the other groups I have come to see how their unique abilities can be used to crush the Harkonnen and make life hell for the Emperor using the Fremen, Atreides, or guild.  Still not used to the Bene Geserit, but haven't played that faction myself yet.I actually play the game with my 10 year old, 8 year old, and 7 year old.  The 7 and 8 year old don't quite grasp the strategy, but follow the rules perfectly.  My wife is not much of a board gamer, but after the first game she came to like the game as well.  After the first game the whole thing flows fairly well.  There are excellent videos from the company detailing the rules in a simple and effective fashion.  But there is a very well written quick start manual in addition to the more detailed manual.  You can start playing pretty quickly - don't believe people who say its too complex.It may not be for people who are easily offended or bear a grudge.  When, as the Fremen you use the sandworm to wipe out someone's entire army, or as the Atriedes use your prescience to trick people into paying a lot of money for a worthless card, or as the Harkonnen destroy someone's entire army by simply controlling their general as a traitor, or as the rich Emperor you gloat over everyone who has to call ""CHOAM charity"" you will sometimes tick off your friends/family and they may seek revenge on you the next round.  I just sit back and watch my children fight each other and me and just laugh, grateful that at the end of the game I don't actually live in the treacherous and Machiavellian world of Frank Herbert's Dune.",5.0

1727,1947494503,R3542SE7MQVG46,I‚Äôm so glad I own this game,"  This game is a classic. This is the most recent rerelease of the game since it first came out around 1979. It is highly political, combative and focused around occupying territories. It include Factions in the game play so if you‚Äôre not used to that, you basically have multiple character groups to choose from to play during the game. Every faction has its strengths and weaknesses. Once the game picks up you have the option to form alliances with other players and their factions. This allows players to share their strengths with other players and hopefully helping you both win the game together.There are many twists and turns that the game takes and it is very strategy heavy. Best part is that everyone has a different strategy because everyone‚Äôs character is so different. And yes there is backstabbing that can happen in this game.  Learning the game took us a few game plays and we still haven‚Äôt narrowed down all of the specifics and have had to google a couple things to get more clarity on how to proceed in specific situations. Also - it‚Äôs a long game. We‚Äôve only played a few times but one of our games did end up lasting for 5 hours. It‚Äôs such a great game for board game enthusiasts. I definitely recommend it!",5.0
1728,1947494503,R1WBCYPJ5NXPSI,A unique experience that you will want to play again and again,"  The GameDune is unlike any other game I've ever played. Every player controls a unique factions with awesome, game-changing advantages and abilities that make each one unique to play and to play against. It is a game of secrets, surprises, alliances, betrayals, conquest and comebacks. Perhaps most intriguing of all, itIt seems daunting at first, there are a lot of rules to go over and almost all of them have an exception to remember. But while that can seem intimidating, the gameplay itself is actually quite easy to pick up, and all those exceptions are lore based and so are easy to remember when you get why they are there. Having started with a group of first timers that don't normally play overly complex board games, I can attest to the fact that it is actually quite accessible. Just take the time to go over the rules, maybe have a quick practice game for a turn or two, and everyone should be able to get it.The rules are broken up into basic and advanced rulesets. I personally recommend skipping to the advanced rules right away since they are where the best parts of the game are and you don't want to have to unlearn bad habits from the basic rules. That said, I think the general consensus is to ignore the ""Advanced Combat"" rules which just add a distinctly unfun spice tax to battles. The Advanced Combat rules are meant to be paired with the Increased Spice Flow rules, which add more money to the economy, and many groups keep those even after ignoring the spice tax because it adds a little more money and more opportunities for alliances, but it works either way.This VersionThis game is a re-release of a classic board game that, as I understand it, had been held up by rights issues for decades. People have been waiting for this game to hit the market again since the 80s, and often printed up their own versions, and there's been an active tournament scene. It is a game that has withstood the test of time and then some.The art, layout and build quality are excellent. The cutouts from the battle wheel also give you extra blank tokens, which are good for homebrewing or simply making additional trackers or tokens (I used mine to make tokens showing the benefits of controlling certain strongholds, which can be passed to the player controlling them). There's a lot of information that is displayed clearly and concisely, it looks beautiful doing it, and the materials are all built to last.I do have a few nitpicks in the design. First, the faction tokens which sit in front of each player are in the middle of a ring around the board where the storm tracker goes, forcing you to move it out of the way when they overlap. It's a harmless annoyance, but it was also a completely avoidable design flaw. Second, the orange and red factions are just a little too close in color, and in a dimly lit room, they can occasionally be confused at a glance. Third, there is a phase tracker on the board but the token that travels along it is not included for those that didn't pre-order, and even we didn't get a fancy 3d printed sandworm, a simple cardboard ring would have been nice. And I've seen several groups that highlighted the line marking the borders of Fremen staging grounds, which should have been a clear part of the map or at least given as a map in a reference guide for the Fremen player to be able to see (I made one from a small printout of the map).But as I said, these are nitpicks, the kind of thing I would like to see fixed in future releases but not any reason to hold back now.The PublisherWhen I got the game, I found several components were damaged (seemingly in manufacturing) and contacted the publisher. They responded quickly and sent replacement parts in the form of a mostly complete game which had almost certainly been a return, but which had all the items I needed essentially untouched. Except the board itself was more damaged than the one I had. After contacting them again, they rushed out a new copy of the game rather than risk another problem.Excellent customer service that focused on resolving the problem and which went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of.The GameplayThe majority of the game revolves around bidding for treachery cards (equipment), landing and moving troops, and resolving battles.* The bidding phase has players take turns bidding or passing on face down cards, with the card going to whoever has the highest bid once all others have passed, an auction with the structure of betting in poker. Each turn will have a number of cards up for bid equal to the number of players that aren't at their hand limit, so just enough for everyone to get a single card in theory, but.* The movement phase lets players land a single stack of troops in any one territory on the board (except in a storm or a stronghold with 2 factions), limited only by the cost and the number of reserves they currently have. They may also move a single stack of troops on the board, allowing them to attack enemies, gather spice (money), or simply move to safety. You only get one landing and one movement per turn, so despite all the depth of strategy, turns are fairly quick and the choices are often agonizing.* The battle phase resolves those battles set up in the movement phase. Each battle happens on two levels, the troops and the leaders. Each player puts together a secret battle plan consisting of the number of troops they are willing to sacrifice, the leader they are sending in, and any treachery cards they want to play, mostly weapons and defenses. If a weapon is played and the other player does not play a corresponding defense (ranged or poison), the targeted leader is killed. When the plans are revealed, add the number of troops sacrificed to the bonus from the leaders if they survived, and the side with the higher number wins. The winner loses all the troops they sacrificed, the loser loses all their troops and any equipment they played, and both sides keep their own leader if they survived. And if the leader they played is the one whose card you secretly chose from 4 dealt to you at the beginning of the game to be your traitor, you can negate the entire battle, wiping out their side entirely while losing nothing.* You win the game by holding three strongholds by yourself at the end of a turn or four strongholds between yourself and an ally at the end of a turn.What makes those interesting are the unique factions.* The Atreides can look at the face down cards as they are being bid on, and have a reliable income selling information both before and after the bidding, and they can ask to know one part of their enemy's plan in every battle.*The Harkonen get double the treachery cards and four times the traitors, and after winning a fight they can kidnap an enemy leader or just kill one and sell its corpse.* The Fremen don't have to pay to bring in troops, can move faster in the desert, are resistant to the hazards of the dessert, and have special forces that count as double troops.* The Bene Gesserit can compel opponents to play or not play a specific card in a battle, get free charity every turn, can choose to be noncombatants to peacefully coexist with other factions whether they like it or not, and can turn worthless cards into miracle cards.* The Spacing Guild takes its movement phase whenever it chooses rather than in the turn order, pays half price for landing troops, and is the one everyone else pays when they land troops* The emperor has special forces, and is the one who collects all the money paid for cards in the bidding phase.There's more, but you should be able to see from the summary above that the interaction of these factions is fascinating and dynamic. Especially since they can ally with each other and share some of their advantages.And of course, the special victory conditions are great. The game has a 10 turn limit. If no one has achieved victory at the end of the 10th turn, and no other special victory conditions are achieved, the spacing guild (and ally if any) wins for having maintained the status quo. If at the end, the Fremen (or no one) have control of their ancestral strongholds and no great houses hold the smuggler's stronghold, the Fremen (and ally if any) wins for having kept the outsiders from taking control. And then there's the Bene Gesserit, who at the beginning of the game choose a faction and a turn number. If that faction wins on that turn, they have played into the manipulative hands of the Bene Gesserit, whose carefully prepared schemes come to fruition, granting the Bene Gesserit (but NOT their ally) the true victory (possibly my favorite rule in any game ever).TL:DRGet this game.

1736,1947494503,R3UGNPAN588U0Y,Beautiful reprint with streamlined and clarified rules you can probably get for under $50,"  This is a beautiful reprinting of the 1979 original which was then printed by Avalon Hill. This reprinting, in addition to the absolutely beautiful and stylized art throughout, clarifies some rules and provides both a basic and advanced play option, complete with a quick start guide. They've also streamlined and clarified some rules, as well as made various balance changes both overall and faction-specific. Presumably this will lead to better game play (and definitely faster games with the maximum number of game turns being reduced to 10 from 15 in the original), but I haven't played yet to verify. Also if you were really invested in getting the 1979 experience but don't want to track down a beat up original copy, the original rules are available online and this game will pretty easily facilitate that with some small changes (like providing the Bene Gesserit a way to pick up to turn 15 as the end turn). Cardboard is sturdy and nice, much more resilient and with better tactile feel than the original.So the bad for me is, first and foremost, I'd like a little more contrast on the game board itself. The colors on the cards and tokens are great, but then the board itself, while stylized and fitting for the game, isn't quite as easy to glance at and pick out all the important details as I would like. Some borders seem a little difficult to read, especially with how irregularly shaped they are, and certain graphics sort of blend in when they should stand out more, I think. Maybe my opinion on this will change from an actual play through, but my first impression is that it could be a little easier to read with more contrast/color to some graphics on the board.Secondly, the spice tokens are utilitarian and the least beautiful part of the game to me. They do their job, but considering the special place of the spice in the Dune universe, I want these to feel like more than bulk coins even if that's all they are mechanically. I'll probably replace the cardboard chits with plastic ""shards"" of some sort that look appropriate.Lastly, the price. I got this from GameNerdz for about $38. There was a deal at the time, but I don't think it was 50% off as a preorder. Shop around a bit before committing to a listing almost double what was available.",5.0

1755,B07F454YF3,RMUWJ0HHWR61,Highly strategic asymetric war game with deceptively cute artwork,"  In root, various factions of animals are competing for control of the clearings in the forests.In the base set, the factions are the Cats, the Birds, the Woodland Animals and the Vagabond (a thieving little raccoon).Each faction has a very different strategy, starting position and abilities which enable them to score victory point. The first to score 30 points wins (though there is an alternate route to winning which keeps things interesting at the end, no matter who is in the lead).The initial learning curve is a bit steep. People new to gaming may be put off. Anyone who has played a complicated Euro game or a deck builder should be able to pick it up fairly quickly. But because the factions are so totally different, I'd suggest watching a video on how to play before diving in.The cats start out controlling most of the forest. They are the world's manufacturers. They build sawmills and workshops and can heal wounded troops. They are limited to three actions per turn, but can spend ""bird cards"" (which are wild) to add an action.The birds are, well, bird brains. They have a leader who will issue blueprints for the birds to follow. For their main actions all the birds can do is follow it exactly. This is easy early on, but since they have to add to the plan each time, it gets more and more dangerous as the rounds progress. One false step and they end up in turmoil and lose points and to a large extent must start over. So they need to get out fast (how birdlike!) in case  they have to fall back and regroup.The Woodland Animals are the most complex. They spread sympathy around the forest and can initiate revolts where they've succeeded in doing so. Eventually, they can marshall an army and start doing some real damage.The Vagabond is the most interesting. He can't control any territory. He just slips in and out of the forest and takes the items other people make (though he pays for them with cards). Instead of warriors, he has items that get damaged. While everyone else is battling it out, he can sneak out of nowhere and make off with the victory.There's so much more to this game, though. Each territory is a specific type (mouse, fox or bunny). Sometimes to move you have to lose a card of the appropriate type. If you don't have one, you can't move. You need to control the right type(s) of clearings to craft items (and if you are the birds, to do any of your other actions). You can only move if you control the clearing you are leaving or the one you are going to (unless you are the Vagabond, who can slip through the forest).It's a lot to keep track of, but it means there are a lot of different successful strategies to winning.Plus, any player can decide to take his/her marker off the victory point path and declare an intention to dominate certain territories (e.g., two opposite corners). If he/she can accomplish this and last to the beginning of the next turn without the other characters taking him/her out, that player wins.In short, this is a great, strategic game for serious gamers, with really cute artwork and components. So clever and fast-moving once you get the hang of gameplay. Love it!",5.0
1756,B07F454YF3,R3J6YZXSB69J7X,A Masterpiece of Asymmetrical Game Design! Not for the Faint of Heart!,"  Root is a truly original game design. It's part area-control, part card/action selection and part war game with an amazing set of four totally different factions, and I do mean TOTALLY different factions! Each factions is almost playing an entirely different mini-game with the larger game! I kid you not.  And as strange as that sounds, it all works...brilliantly!In principle, Root is simple: the first faction to gain 30 victory points wins. The board is a giant forest with several clearings marked by a 'suit' (fox, mouse, bunny, birds). Players compete to control these clearings. Players play suited cards to do actions in said clearings that match the suit of the card they're playing (i.e. need to play a bunny suited card to do an action in a clearing with a bunny suit.). Some cards also can be 'crafted' to gain a special ability, again matching suit of the card to the suit of the clearing where you want to do the action!Movement is based on area control. You can only move into or from a clearing you control (i.e. having the most units/buildings).Combat is super simple: the attacker rolls two dice and takes the higher total, eliminating that many of the defenders units; the defender does the same with the lower numbered dice.  However, the attacker/defender can never eliminate more units then the size of his attacking/defending force. For example-attacking with 4 units and rolling a '5'. You only get to kill 4 units, not five. The same applies to the defender. Furthermore, there are cards and various faction abilities that can modify battle results in interesting ways.That in essence is how root plays....simple....but....the factions turn all this on it's head!At its heart, Root is a war game between the ruthless denezins of a fairy tale-like forest setting:THE CATS:  The Cats run the forest as a vast labor camp. They score victory points by developing structures within the forest clearings and keeping the 'status quo.'THE BIRDS (EYRIE):  The Eyrie used to run things until the cats came along, and they want their power and control back. They're fast, ruthless and are the strongest military power! They gain VPs by expanding their influence! They can spread like wildfire and crush the mightiest of foes! BUT....they have one great flaw: Their government is highly unstable! One wrong move can bring down their entire power structure and thwarting their plans!THE WOODLAND ALLIANCE: The Alliance represents all the other woodland creatures suffering under the yoke of the cats. They're the rebels! They want the Cats overthrown, and they want the Birds gone too! POWER TO THE PEOPLE! The Woodland alliance fights a guerilla war to free the forest of tyranny! They get VPs by overthrowing the Cats and the Birds.THE VAGABOND: The shifty Vagabond are the allegedly ""neutral"" raccoons. They've decided to become the merchants of death and profit from the growing war in the woodlands! They can 'aid' and/or hinder each faction for their own selfish reasons, hoping to become wealthy from the chaos! They can gain VPs by helping the various factions at crucial moments, and even side with a faction and ride their coat tales to victory!To win, you HAVE to be ruthless! There's no room in this game for care bears! The first faction to get a VP engine going can run away with game if the other players are not careful! Such VP leaders must be crushed! And the asymmetricral design of the game really brings this to life. The factions really to play that differently and have their own special way to victory. No two are even remotely similar!The game has only two downsides. 1) It's MEAN as heck. You can show no mercy in this game. 2) It's incredibly hard to teach because it is so different. Watching videos is pretty much mandatory.",5.0
1757,B07F454YF3,R29MDIFTF1L2T3,I'm rating this one a don't buy üò£,"  I'll try and make this review short, which the game and rule book isn't. And that's the main problem. My wife and I have played about every board game under the sun and after reading all the rule books, yes there is more than one, we still were not sure how to play it. That is very frustrating, and I would dread having to explain it to a new or casual gamer.Basically this game is 4 totaly different games all being played at the same time, on the same board but with different cards, tokens and rules.In the end we both felt confused when playing this game for the first time. Thats when I said well maybe this is the most poorly written rule book ever and tried to find a youtube video or two that explained it better, but even after watching many we still had questions.Board games just dont need to be this complicated. If you are one of the few who can figure this one out, you have a talent but its a talent you will not be able to share much because there are just way better games out there at less than half the price that people love to play.",1.0
1758,B07F454YF3,R2T8MAKTDDDMWG,A great game that gets better with a second playthrough,"  Root is a four player, asymmetrical war game. Players are trying to obtain 30 victory points or complete an object on a dominance card to win.For Setup, each player receives one of four factions (Marquise de Cat, Eyrie Dynastie, Woodland Alliance, or Vagabond) pieces and player board. The board itself will either be placed on the autumn or winter side. On the game board, players will place score markers, ruines, and crafting resources. The shared deck (54 cards) will be shuffled and 3 cards given to each player. Then players in faction order will place their starting pieces on the board.GameplayGeneral: Movement- when players do a move action they will be able to move one or all Warriors from one clearing to an adjacent one. The rule for movement is Warriors must be the rulers of the clearing they are moving from or to. To be a ruler, players must have the most combine Warriors and Buildings (square tokens). Battling- When a battle is initiated, the attacking player will roll the two costume dice. The attacker will gain the highest rolled die and the defender will have the lowest die (ties are possible). During the start of a battle a defending player may play an ambush card matching the clearing (remove two enemy Warriors), but it can be cancelled if attacking player plays an ambush card in response (also matching the clearing). Eliminating player tokens (square or circle tokens) will give one victory point for each one taken off the board (Warriors do not give victory points). Cards- players will use the cards drawn to either activate locations with suits (bunny, mouse, fox, and birds) matching the clearing, or they will be used to craft. Birds are wild and can be used for any clearing. In order to craft, players must have crafting pieces in the required clearing/s found on the bottom left of the card. Each crafting pieces can be activated once per player turn. Crafting cards will give victory points listed on the card. Factions- each faction will go through three phases and then the next faction to the left will take their turn (Birdsong, Daylight, Evening). Each faction will have alternate ways of scoring victory points.Factions: Marquise de Cat (additional victory points by building)  Birdsong- place one wood at the sawmill.  Daylight- Craft a card using workshops built. Three actions are then able to be taken which can be Battle, March, Recruit (one time), Build, and Overwork. Additional actions can be taken if the player spends bird cards.  Evening- Draw one card and one additional card per uncovered draw bonus. More than 5 cards, player must discard down to 5. Eyrie Dynastie (additional victory points for each roost built)  Birdsong- add one to two card onto any column in the decree. Only one card can be a bird card. Decree is found above the player‚Äôs board and will have actions listed for each of the four spots found.  Daylight- Craft a card using roosts. Decrees must then be activated in order from left to right for each column of cards. Order is Recruit, Move, Battle, and Build. If a player is unable to do one of the actions listed, the Eyrie Dynastie falls into Turmoil. Turmoil will cause a player to lose one victory point for each bird card in their decree. All cards are discarded in the decree except the two Loyal Viziers cards. Current leader is discarded, and a new one is chosen (begin game with four leaders). Finally player in Turmoil will immediately go to the evening phase.  Evening- Score victory points that match the rightmost empty roost tracker on player board. Also, draw one card and an additional card per uncovered draw bonus. Discard down to 5 cards if over 5. Woodland Alliance (additional victory points for spreading sympathy)  Birdsong- First, a Revolt can occur which will cause the player to discard two supporters that match the clearing that has a sympathy token. All enemy pieces are removed from the clearing and a matching base is placed in the area. Secondly, sympathy can be spread from one clearing to an adjacent one. This is done by discarding supporters that match the clearing suit. Supporters come from the supporting deck on the player‚Äôs board. This is an additional set of cards that are not in the player‚Äôs hand. They begin the game with three support cards.  Daylight- Craft a card using sympathy tokens. Mobilize, add a card in hand to the supporter area. Train, spend a card that matches the suit of a built base to put a Warrior in the Officers box. This will create officers that are needed to do military operations in the evening.  Evening- Per officer will allow the player to perform Move, Battle, Recruit, and Organize. Finally, draw one card and one additional card per uncovered draw bonus. Discard down to 5 cards if hand is over 5. Vagabond (additional victory points for aiding other players and completing missions)  Birdsong- Un-exhaust three items, and an additional two for each teapot token. Slip action, player can move the Vagabond to any adjacent space including the forest space.  Daylight- Exhaust item tokens to complete actions like Move, Battle, Strike, Explore, Aid, Quest, Craft, Repair, and activate special action. Player begins the game with three quest cards. When one is completed another is drawn.  Evening- If in forest, repair all damage items. Draw one card and additional one card for each coin item. Discard cards over five. Finally, discard items in satchel and damage area that is more than 6 items (plus 2 for each bag token).Winning the game: When a player has obtained 30 victory points, they automatically win the game. An alternative way to win is by playing a dominance card. It can only be played after a player reaches 10 victory points. They will permanently remove their score marker, and will be trying to control designated clearings listed on the dominance card. If they can control the clearings by the start of their next Birdsong phase, they win the game.Root is a phenomenal war game that has wonderful art, and fantastic gameplay. Players will feel different with each faction played. Learning the game is the only thing that feels daunting in the game. Reading the rules gives a good idea of how the game flows, but it needs to be played to be understood. The game gives a lot of ways to learn how to play from a walkthrough, learn to play rulebook, and a rulebook for people that want to know the rules in a straightforward manner. It is after the first game that players will really understand what they are trying to accomplish in the game with their faction. Each faction has their own strengths and weaknesses, but none feel overpowering. The general feeling will be the ease of play between each faction with the Marquise de Cats being the easiest to learn while the Vagabond is easy too, but understanding how items work may be difficult. Each faction also have additional abilities not mentioned like Eyrie Dynastie rule even when tied, or Marquise de Cats are able to return Warriors removed. The game is fast, especially for the first time as the cats are constantly moving their victory point marker forward on each of their turns. When players learn how the game works it will be around an hour and a half. A flaw can be seen in game with the fact that if a player gets ahead they may win the game as it could be difficult to catch up, but this is mostly a first game issue. The luck of the draw also helps players, but it is never a ‚Äúthis changed the game‚Äù type of event. It is more like ‚Äúthat helped a little‚Äù. Usually after the first game, most players will stay group together on the score marker track as obtaining victory points becomes easier to accomplish after the first play through, since it is easier to understand how a faction scores. This game is great as players will feel unique, and the ease of play that is found in this game will quickly make players want to play again.Teaching the game: Make it clear to the players that victory points are obtained from any token removed (square or circle), ruling include buildings, and crafting items is limited to what is available on the board. Players will have to play through the game at least once to really get a feel for the faction they are playing as in the game. Easiest faction to be in order are Marquise de Cat, Eyrie Dynastie, Woodland Alliance, and the Vagabond. When choosing factions, think about the type of games people like to play. Knowing someone likes building an engine would like the cats while someone that enjoys planning all their moves would like the Eyrie Dynastie.",4.0

1761,B07F454YF3,R1FHICO5CKEZLW,Asymetric Critter Warfare,"  Root is a game in which 4 factions play entirely different roles:  The cats control the whole forest, the birds want to reclaim it, the alliance is fed up with warfare and the vagabond....well the vagabond likes to sow chaos, completing quests, killing the casual enemy soldier and slipping away into the deepness of the forest.The Art of the game is lovely and while it may feel daunting at the beggining, the game is pretty easy to learn once you run a couple of games.Dont' be fooled by the cute characters though, this is a light wargame with variables as the board can be converted into winter and there is an expansion with river critters and religious lizzards.A great game overall!!!",5.0
1762,B07F454YF3,R1H17ALIXQN4XW,"The game is brilliant. The board quality, on the other hand...","  Root is a fully asymmetric territory control wargame. The idea is that each of the factions is a different type of army looking to take over the woodlands for their own purposes. (Something of a Redwall-esque theme, if you happen to know the series.)  To give an idea of how asymmetric this really is, there's a set of common rules that are shared by all the factions, and then each faction also has their own rules section that's roughly as long as the common rules. There's a few basic concepts shared by all the factions, but each faction is a very different playing experience.Speaking of the factions, you have the Marquise Cat, who plays most similar to a standard wargame. They've got a ton of flexibility, but not enough actions to both manage the board and score a ton of points at the same time. There's the Eyrie Dynasty, who build up a decree that continually gives them more actions to take but also demands they take those actions. Prevent them from fulfilling it, and you knock them into turmoil and force them to rebuild from scratch. There's the Woodland Alliance, the plucky guerrilla fighters. They harass the other factions by placing sympathy, and the very act of stamping it out means giving them cards to place more sympathy on their next turn. Or you could leave it there, but then they have the action to revolt and take over the entire clearing. And finally there's the Vagabond, a solo wanderer who's looking for his own place. Instead of fighting for control of the board, he's actually just exploring ruins, getting items that other factions have crafted, completing quests, and occasionally knocking other factions down a peg to balance things out a little.Overall, the game is incredibly well designed, the art and the theme is great, and if you have the time to put into it, the gameplay is incredibly rewarding. It'll take a couple of plays for everyone to really understand all the options of all the factions. On the one hand, that is a major investment, but those learning games are still fun, and the depth of the options that open up afterwards is amazing. And this is even before the expansions come into play.However, I do have one complaint regarding the game, and that's the component quality. The actual pieces themselves are fine. The meeples and the cards are great, and the various small cardboard tokens and such are serviceable. However, the faction boards and the actual main board itself have started bending slightly. This is despite being stored in a dry, non-humid place, and being put flat on the bottom of the box beneath the weight of everything else. When it comes out for play, it's an irritating exercise trying to get the main board to lay flat, and the faction boards need to be bent a little by hand to undo the curve they've acquired while being stored.Overall, I consider this a minor complaint for a brilliant game, but it is an annoyance, and if there's another seller or source without these problems, it'd be worth considering.",4.0
1763,B07F454YF3,RLX0XS3T2ZTEB,Fantastic asymmetric game that really makes you think,"  Root has been on my radar since its first Kickstarter. I finally picked this up, along with the first expansion. The second expansion should be releasing later this month in fact.There is a genre of games known as asymmetric. In these games, each player is effectively playing an entirely different game from one another, but together. Probably the best example would be Android: Netrunner where one player plays the corporation and the other plays a hacker. They are effectively fighting against each other, but even the very nature of their turns have no resemblance to one another.While some games claim to be asymmetric, they really just give each player a unique power or ability. This is not the same thing at all. Root is a truly asymmetric game, much like its predecessor: ""Vast: The Crystal Caverns"". Each player takes on one of four different factions (more with expansions) to either vie for control of the forest, or to meet their own personal goals (as is the case with the Vagabond character).Our family has really taken to this game within a few plays. This include my wife and our 8, 10 and 13 year olds. While our 8 year old does need help even with the faction that is labeled as having the lowest complexity (the cats), she still really enjoys it. My 10 year old has no issues at all and was giving us some pretty heavy competition.Still, the game is not light-weight and does come with a pretty steep learning curve. That said, once you have one of the factions down, it is VERY easy to break out the game and have everyone grab the same faction they played with last time, and get down to business quickly.If you are looking for a game that has great production value, is unbelievably well balanced, offers solid replay-ability and is guaranteed to provide many fun evenings of making your friends and family hate you (in love, of course), Root is definitely a solid option.",5.0

Leder games does to to create a unique gaming experience.Know the group that you want to play this game with before suggesting it. And like others have said, give it 2-3 play throughs before passing final judgement. Once you understand how all the factions interact it is really quite fun. I will be continuing to play this whenever I get a chance.",5.0
1765,B07F454YF3,R297CRMT4BKZEU,Great Thoughtful Game,"  It's about the empire of the Marquess de Cat, which has just taken over the forest, doing battle with the Eyrie Clans of birds who're trying to restore their power while facing internal collapse. Except it's also about the Woodland Alliance which is starting a revolution against them both. And about the Vagabond who's wandering around doing odd jobs and helping the other factions. And with the (first) expansion, it's also about a Lizard Cult and the capitalist otters of the River Company. It's Gambit Pileup, the Game, where everybody's schemes collide.Every faction plays differently and has different ways to get victory points, and it's possible to claim certain special goals. I did pretty badly as the Alliance, spreading unrest throughout the forest and launching one successful uprising and a raid but never establishing a second base or building items besides a crossbow. Meanwhile there were giant armies of cats and birds fighting each other. The Vagabond was absent (3-player game), so we didn't get to see his gameplay, but it involves collecting items made by the other players and then using them to complete quests like ""give a speech"" or ""fight some bandits"". The cats rely on building structures to get more stuff, while the birds make increasingly bold Decrees to take more and more actions but inevitably crash at some point. In a second playthrough I was the Vagabond playing against the cats and birds, finding myself playing kingmaker and attacking both to stop either from winning. I finally gained enough gadgets to invoke a devastating one-beaver uprising that someone on BoardGameGeek compared to that supervillain with the doom gauntlet. So I've had two very different experiences already, and bought the game.It's a little intimidating to get started, but the current edition comes with not just a rulebook and a How To Play booklet but an extra sheet that walks you through two full turns. I see that BGG has a printable rulesheet to let you play solo against the cats even without owning the expansion.Seemed like fun despite the tricky intro process. Because there are asymmetric goals, I don't greatly mind that it's focused on an abstract notion of VPs. I can kind of feel like I'm doing something interesting and creating some sort of story, even if I'm not winning. The fact that each side has different rules isn't too hard to understand, because there are common features like crafting and movement that can help you understand other factions, and cards to remind you what the others are trying to do.The board and pieces are well made and pleasant, I should add. Deceptively cute for what is potentially a brutal game.Would I recommend this to people new to modern board games, ie. people who've never heard of Settlers or Pandemic or Dominion or Splendor? No, I'd probably start them off with something a bit simpler. If someone like that does want to play, I suggest starting them off with the cats. It's definitely worth playing if you're familiar with modern gaming though!",5.0
1766,B07F454YF3,R1E0O8NQZ3VUUT,Root is for board game lovers. LOVE IT,"  If you like interesting board games not just simple ones like Life or Sorry, and you normally play things like Settlers or any interesting strategic game, then this is an awesome game for you. There is a little bit of a learning curve as each player has different roles and abilities but that's a plus. It took us less than 30 minutes to learn and we've been able to teach other people in a fairly short amount of time. New players pick it up quickly. Play in once is definitely like a practice game and by the second time people really seem to understand the strategy better for that particular role. This has quickly become my family's favorite game.",5.0
1767,B07F454YF3,R2XEP01PR04WCJ,One of the best games ever made. Period.,"  I wanted to write this to specifically counter negative reviews, based in the game being too ""complicated"" , or the rules being too confusing (especially people ripping on the fact that there are TWO rulebooks). Yes, there are two. But they convey the same information. The designers cleverly anticipated the fact that different people prefer different approaches to learning games and tried to account for that. It's not like there are ""twice as many rules""...it bothers me to see this game receive negative criticism due to ineptitude, rather than valid critiques.The rules are actually quite simple. I was able to hand my roommate the rulebook, and have him skim through the two short pages of rules for his faction. And even though he's not an avid gamer, he had no problem whatsoever, hopping right in with confidence. The only real complexity comes from trying to figure out how to do well against three other factions that all behave slightly differently. It's an ""easy to learn, hard to master"" game...but it's not that complicated at all, if you've played even a few modern board games.It's fine if you think it's a challenging game to learn (many would disagree). But I don't think it's fair to call this a bad game, simply because you can't understand the rules.",5.0
1768,B07F454YF3,RXB8WDRQQYJDL,"Havent Played, Still Confused",  I bought this game over 2 months ago and I still have no clue how to play it. I have read through the instructions as best I could and watched a 2 hour long youtube video and still dont know how to play it. I was under the impression that this was a 2-4 player game but the instructions are specifically for 4 player only. being in quarantine we only have the option for 2 players at the moment. We even tried to play 2 characters each and followed the instructions word for word but still dont understand any of it. We play a wide variety of board games and this was/is by far the hardest to learn. I doubt I will ever figure it out and the process in trying to sucks the joy out of the game. I wanted to like this. The design is beautiful and it looks like A LOT of fun but I am at the point of giving up on this. I would rather move on to games that are designed to teach players effectively.,3.0
1769,B07F454YF3,R1J808YG8BXXQY,Love the game! Just be careful with the rules.,"  Love this game so far.After my second play through with friends I purchased their newest Kickstarter campaign for the next expansion.This game is downright adorable! It can be a little intimidating at first, and I'll be honest I spent at least an hour going over rules for this game.I think the most missed item is the fact that you craft all your cards and they are permanent to you.We were under the impression for most the game that crafting was for the items you got from the vagabond.Made everyone a little irritated and when we went online to forums to try and understand, they just told us to ""read the rules and play."" The community definitely was not encouraging or helpful concerning that.Other than that minor hiccup, everything is great! Love it and recommend it to everyone.",5.0
1770,B07F454YF3,R27LUG12WQOU1V,"A good but overpriced game, not easy to learn!","  Buyer beware: This game is called asymmetrical for a reason, all factions in this game play differently and you kind of need to know what the other factions do while you are playing the game, so you kind of really need to learn all factions to play the game... But once you past this issue, this game is really well balanced and plays really well in all player counts, gameplay is very smooth as well! I would recommend this game to more advanced players, not someone just getting into the hobby of board games right now.Also, I do need to mention that the price point of this game seem a little bit on the higher side, especially when it is in between prints and scalpers charge really high prices... I would probably pay around 39.99/45.99, not more than that...",3.0
1771,B07F454YF3,R2MU8KUS99JXC0,My Favorite Game,"  Pros:1. Cute artwork, pieces, and theme2. Replay-ability is high due to different factions3. Asymmetrical interesting game-play due to variable factions4. Short time-frame (90min-ish) for the amount of experience you get5. Cute theme has translated into people liking a war-like game when they otherwise would have been put off by itCons:1. Maybe a bit tough to teach at first. The teacher has to explain/know how everyone's faction functions (usually it takes me 2 turns to walk people through their turn before I can just answer their questions from afar)2. At lower player counts you're forced to have certain faction combinations in play to keep it balanced (but honestly, sometimes its just fun to throw that out the window and try a weird combo of factions)Everyone loves this game. Buy it. If you don't love it too, it won't be that hard to resell or gift it to someone who will love it.",5.0

1774,B07F454YF3,R3IB3RIANNAHI6,A very good game with lots or replayability.,"  The graphics on this game are quite adorable.  But don't let that mislead you.  This game is a game of cut throat strategy.  For people who play more complicated board games this one won't be a challenge.  If your idea of a board game is life and monopoly then this will be more challenging for you.  It takes a bit of time to figure everything out, but it is well worth it.  My 11 year old did it, so can you.  We have a lot of fun with it!",5.0
1775,B07F454YF3,R1NPOZTQY7OW8F,Fantastic board game,  This game is so much fun I decided to buy the expansion after first play and am planning a 6 player group for when it shows up for our fourth or fifth play.So far I have played the Alliance twice in a four person game and the cats once in a three person game and can't wait to try the other two(or four if you count the expansion en route).The magic in this game comes from how everyone is playing a different strategy game against other groups who have to employ their own strategy of the many possible for each faction.Its got a lot of flavor and apparently a second expansion coming soon. Definitely worth the money for anyone who likes to play with different strategies to reach a victory or plays with a tactile group of friends.,5.0
1776,B07F454YF3,RAAR94F4MTA7I,Super Fun Asymmetrical Game,"  Don't be fooled by the art...this game is way complicated and complex. But in a good way. Probably. I really like it, but my gaming partners were constantly confused by it. The rules are clear...but also very complicated, so unless everyone is paying really close attention, it can be a difficult game to get through. That being said, it does really well what it is trying to do, which is why it already has multiple expansions and a loyal fan base.  I don't expect this game to get a ton of play time because it takes a special sort of group to play it, but I  will happily play it whenever someone suggests it.I was a little miffed that right after I bought this, they announced a new printing with several important corrections on it...corrections I can get for $5, so not too bad, but still...I guess I should have waited.",4.0
1777,B07F454YF3,R3V4NF085HM80I,A fantastic entry-level war game with a sugary coat.,"  I love this game. My girlfriend loves this game. It has really intriguing asymmetrical gameplay and once you get the expansions, it opens up the possibilities and encourages many replays. It's overwhelming to learn, at first, but once you get a game under your belt, you begin to see how simple the game is, and how deep it can be. It's not, at all, the deepest and most strategic game on the market, but it is a fantastic entry point for those interested in that side of board gaming. With two instruction manuals and a two-turn walkthrough, this is one of the more well-documented board games out there. There are a few rule questions that BoardGameGeek forums can help with, but the team at Leder Games constantly tries to update and clarify rules.The art is absolutely adorable and it helps to cut the tension of what would be an otherwise harsh game. The theming is also fantastic with careful decisions of what colors, tokens, pieces, warriors, action, etc should look and feel like.I'd highly recommend this game to people looking to take some steps into the war-game side of board games, but have something accessible for casual gamers that are looking for something meaty-yet-fun, without an enormous emotional commitment to something like Twilight Imperium.",5.0
1778,B07F454YF3,R3KQ3R3CNDX5MU,An Amazing Asymmetric Game,"  An asymmetric game that is fairly easy to pick up but has unique outcomes all the time. I've played it quite a bit, and I am never disappointed. I appreciated the walk through that was provided, which helped me and my kids get the hang of the mechanics. I don't know any other game that provides it, but I know few games that have such crazy different play with each character choice.If you like creative, unique complexities in the play between each person, this is your game.",5.0
1779,B07F454YF3,R1FW8ATAN2I2WW,Complex but beautiful and fun,"  We've played Root several times now and I am really liking it. Each of the 4 animal houses play very different from each other, so every game will feel like a whole different experience. Alliances will be made or broken in the blink of an eye as each faction works towards victory. The artwork and components in this game are beautiful. It has a childlike innocence to the style. The game gets better with more players in my opinion, unlike many other games that just drag on longer with added players. Each added player in Root adds more to the chaos, options, and fun. The rules can be a bit complex, so I wouldn't suggest it as a gateway game into board gaming, but an experienced gaming group will likely love this game. The easiest way to learn how each animal faction works is to simply play a game as them. Eventually you will find which ones feel more like your own preferred playstyle. My personal favorite is the Vagabond. Hope you like the game.",5.0

There is also a simplified rule book and a more in-depth rule book included, so there are answers to questions that may come up.The only reason why I'm rating it four stars is due to the box damage when it was shipped. The game itself is phenomenal, though, and it deserves five stars.",4.0

Again, this is primarily a light browsing tool and a movie player for when I am travelling. It's nice and light weight, and can hold a 64GB microSD card. Coupled with VLC, I can bring some movies with me to go.",3.0
1876,B00MOURUR0,RTZFLY50QWUUF,Couldn't Be Happier!,"  Despite an error on the listing stating this tab has a front and back camera (it only has a rear facing camera), I am super thrilled with this tablet.  I purchased 2, one for each of my boys for Christmas, and when I checked them out after delivery I had a hard time believing they are refurbished.  I tried to find even one scuff or scratch, but they were both literally perfect- as good as new if not ACTUALLY new.  Like others have written, I tried two each of two different ""cheap"" tablets- an RCA and a NexTab (I think) both around $60 and each a complete waste of money (or would have been if I did not return them). 2 of the 4 didn't even work at all, which I fortunately discovered before Christmas morning.  The Christmas budget was pushed to its limit, but spending an extra $50 on each of these Samsung tabs was WELL worth it.  My boys love them.  Excellent speed for their games, a clear, robust screen, and excellent battery life. We have had several Samsung products and I have never had to question the quality of their devices and appliances.  I am glad I found these- super value.",5.0

I also included the fold to show the quality of the strap. It's very sturdy and feels strong when opening and closing. It stays closed without a clip-it's that strong-yet not so strong that it's hard to open. Love that the letters nestle into each square on the board so if someone bangs into the board, they'll stay in place. Of course the turntable is an amazing feature, but it's also on wheels so if you need to pass the board to the other end of the table, it's no problem. I highly recommend this version of scrabble!

I opened the SEALED plastic bag that the tiles came in and found one ""I"" and one ""E"" missing. This is ironic given that the trademark on the box is ""Every Letter Counts."" I ran out to a local store and purchased a less expensive edition, if you call $18.99 less expensive, and cannibalized its bag of tiles. It was an expensive competition, at least for me.",1.0
1908,B00JMCJGZC,R2M58QQY2J5W1W,The Best,"  Forget about looking at the board upside down or getting the tiles shifted when you are trying to rotate your regular game board! This edition solved the problem!! We usually sit at our kitchen table that is made out of slate with a rustic wood panel across the middle section when playing this game as a family. You can imagine the table‚Äôs surface is very uneven. However, this game board rotates on this very uneven surface perfectly! And I absolutely love how each tile sits in its little slot now, so the tiles don‚Äôt need to be realigned. I‚Äôm a little OCD and it bothers me if you put your tiles down and don‚Äôt align them perfectly on regular flat game boards ;) This board won‚Äôt let you do that! Also, the little drawers on both sides are very functional.I‚Äôve read other buyers‚Äô reviews about poor quality of tiles. Well, there‚Äôs no difference between the quality of these tiles and the quality of other inexpensive versions of Scrabble tiles. Unless you‚Äôre used to buying $200+ Scrabble game boards, the tile quality won‚Äôt be a problem for you ;)",5.0

1911,B00JMCJGZC,R17P8D7DRCX2A2,Count your blank tiles before starting.,"  My family loves playing Scrabble.  Having the board turn and the tiles protected from slipping out of place is great.  The reason this receives four stars instead of five is that the wooden tiles are not of the same quality of earlier Scrabble games (they miss the varnish).  We learned as we played our first game with the Deluxe Edition that we'd been give extra blank tiles.  This worked to my advantage (we didn't check the tiles ahead of time) in our first family game as I kept drawing blanks.  Finally my daughter-in-law counted the number of words on the board with blanks, there were five.",4.0
1912,B00JMCJGZC,R3N70MPAQ1ZVVY,Must-Get Scrabble Edition!!!,"  I have played Scrabble since I was a kid, but sadly, a few years ago, my old set got ruined (I was taking it to Speech Therapy patients in my car - the box got ripped, tiles lost, etc.). I had some friends coming over who wanted to play Scrabble and I had enough points on my amazon.com rewards card to get this for ""free!"" It is AWESOME! First of all, it has it's own all-in-one carrying case with a handle - no box that's going to be crushed. Two drawers slide underneath the board to contain your tile holders and tiles. The wheels underneath the board work seamlessly to turn the board with ease. The interlocking (raised) board keeps all of your tiles in place! It is awesome! The only negative I can see is that the tiles aren't made of that nice heavier, wood that they were made of in the past, but that's not a huge thing and definitely won't keep me from playing. I say this is SO worth the extra money to get this set over the traditional set! Oh, and I WON! ;)",5.0

1914,B00JMCJGZC,R3JXMSBXBQDETH,LOVE this set.  Best one for Scrabble.,"  I haven't played scrabble in ages, but I thought it was about time my 11 year old son was introduced to it.I got this one so that we could take it by his grandma's when she babysits him every few weeks.It was even better than I had thought.  I didn't realize that the squares on the boards were recessed so the tiles STAY PUT and won't move even when the board is bumped.  That, right there, gave it the five stars.  LOVE that feature.The rest is also 5 star worthy.  The soft bag to keep the tiles in has drawstrings to help keep it closed, and the two storage bays underneath have plenty of room for the holders and the tiles, as well as things you may want to keep to track scores.It folds up easily, sits flat when opened, and even has small wheels on the bottom so you can spin it around so whoever wants can see everything ""right side up.""Best Scrabble board I've ever seen.",5.0
1915,B00JMCJGZC,R33ERUTZICJLVZ,"Great Game Board, but the tiles ruined it for me!! Do NOT give this as a gift!","  This is a terrific game board! I wanted an extra scrabble game to keep at a second location and this looked like a good deal. I love how the tiles stay in place when you turn it to the other player or back to yourself. It has built-in wheels that help it swivel and raised ridges so the tiles don't slip out of place. I hate it with a regular board how the letters slip and slide around when you turn the board, or even place a tile where it touches another tile and they both shoot off at an angle. And it folds up nicely for traveling.What irritated me no end was how shoddy was the printing on the tiles! Given such a great game board, and a medium premium price, you would kind of expect the tiles to be of a certain minimum quality. Now I read the evaluations that mentioned this, but I figured how bad could it be? In reality, and maybe it's just my personality, but when a tile is printed so the bottom half of the letter is on the top part and the top part of the letter is on the bottom part, it is quite distracting. I finally spent about $12 bucks to order a set of tiles separately from another vendor.Given how great the board was, and how disturbing the tiles were, I would have been better served by upgrading further to a more expensive set. However, if you are willing to buy this set for the game board, and willing to use your old tiles or order a new set of tiles separately, it's a good deal. For me, I regret it. Too much effort! And certainly NOT something I'd ever give as a gift!",3.0
1916,B00JMCJGZC,R2QS2TU5HTDDHB,Loving it.,"  Well I've been wanting one of these for years... Initially I thought the tiles would be locked into the squares on the board and secured so it wouldn't fall off even if it were turn upside down but that's not the case . The board secures the tiles  but they can still fall off.  I like that it has the two drawers at the side to hold the bag with the tiles and the racks so yo have a lesser chance of misplacing and losing them. The quality of the board is top notch too and I was fortunate to get all my racks and all my tiles. Finally, there's I a lil bonus piece of literature that i think is very useful and that is the pamphlet that comes in the drawers with all the playable two letter words. That is truly a gift.",5.0
1917,B00JMCJGZC,R1VVEULUFAJ94,The best set if the price is right.,"  So you may have noticed there's a Scrabble Diamond Anniversary Edition, and then there's this Amazon-exclusive Scrabble Deluxe Edition which, I might add, is WAY better than the current ""Deluxe"" edition in brick-and-mortar stores. But you may ask ""What's the difference between this Deluxe and the Diamond Anniversary Edition?"" and that's a really, really good question.The answer is: Not much.In fact, if you press the stickers on the sides down a bit you'll see that the plastic on this board actually has the logo for the Scrabble Diamond Anniversary Edition embossed into it, with a Scrabble Deluxe sticker pasted over the top of it to hide the previous branding. Yes, kids, this is a Scrabble Diamond board with new stickers.What else is different? The tiles. In the Diamond Anniversary Edition the tiles are black with silver letters embossed into them. In this set, the standard wooden tiles from classic Scrabble are in play. The wood tiles are *slightly* smaller than the black ones, so they sit in the grooves on the board just a little bit less snugly than the black tiles that this board was designed for, but not so much that it noticeable or a problem if you've never played the Diamond version.The racks are the same curved red rack from the Diamond version. The bag is a standard felt-like bag. The manual's actually pretty nice and detailed with some great information, variations on play, and suggestions.So basically, Hasbro mass-produced the Diamond Anniversary edition, and made a deal with Amazon to sell this version as a ""lesser"" model for a lower price, but the only thing ""lesser"" about it is the tiles. If you're really a stickler for a complete Diamond experience, I suppose you could buy some black and silver tiles separately for another fifteen bucks, but I don't see the need.I had the Diamond Anniversary Edition (lost it, though) and I have this Scrabble Deluxe Amazon Exclusive edition,  and I'm here to tell you that if you're spending over a hundred bucks for a Diamond set, you're either a crazy collector, or easily duped into paying way more for nearly the same thing. This IS the Diamond board with a sticker on it.So how does it play? It's a great Scrabble set. The board spins by way of some wheels on the bottom (no, not a turntable, actual little wheels) and it's a smooth experience that makes game play easier for everyone around the table (though it likely won't spin on carpet.)  The whole thing folds up for storage, with two plastic trays built in to hold the racks, scorepads, pencils, tiles, bag, and manual (scorepad sold separately, of course.)It's pretty easy to carry around, though I wouldn't call it totally ""travel"" sized. I wouldn't try to play in a car unless it was a very smooth-riding vehicle and the road had no chance of bumps. For travel it's best to have a magnetic set, which this is not. But for bringing along to places where you have a stable surface to play? Yeah, it's pretty handy.Bottom line: This is the Scrabble set to get if you want a turntable, don't want to spend a hundred bucks, and don't particularly care if the tiles are special limited-edition colors. This will do just fine.Five stars, no question.Update: As another reviewer notes, the tiles with this set are a bit lower quality than the tiles with the standard set. They're perfectly usable. They are all present (in my set, anyway) and the letters and numbers are legible. If you don't like them the easy solution is to swap your tiles from your previous standard edition (come on, you know you had one before buying a Deluxe edition!) or buy another set separately. They're inexpensive. However, I see no reason why most people wouldn't be perfectly happy with the tiles included with this set.",5.0
1918,B00JMCJGZC,R3GRATXC00DRFY,Glad that I read the reviews,"  This version is a really good value in build and design. The board: folds in half and is sturdy with very good attention to detail in design and colors. Definitely a better option than a new flimsy board. Plastic yes but sturdy. The tiles remain in place. And you can turn the board. Retro colors are 50/60/70‚Äôs at least to me. Hold off on getting extra tiles, ref other comments as you want to see the board in real life first and perhaps choosing or not another color besides natural. The tiles in mine, I do not see as stated in reviews, any defects. Hard case for carry, if you don‚Äôt like this, I still think the play board itself is really nicely done with this choice. Glad I read the reviews about the newer one and the retro 1940‚Äôs one too. We are inclined to find used games in very good condition for build quality and nostalgia. Other new nostalgia versions are too expensive and do not have the same build quality of older versions. This version is a really good choice for a retro looking one attention to detail and the tiles stay in place. Happy Gaming!",5.0

1923,B00JMCJGZC,R1W0OQ757CDXZI,"Once you have played with a board like this that keeps the tiles in place, you won't want to go back!","  I used to own the deluxe anniversary edition, which I loved. I lost it in a move and have missed it ever since, until I found this version. I had been searching for an affordable version to rival the edition I lost, and this is it, hands-down. The separation between rows keeps the tiles from going everywhere and you absolutely won't regret the extra $$$ for that benefit alone. The rotating board is wonderful for those who like to see the words from their perspective. You do need a smooth surface for the wheels to rotate the board. I like how it folds for storage, which the deluxe edition did not do, as it was more of a display piece. Next to the very pricey alternatives which are made mostly from wood and look a bit more high-end than plastic, this is your best bet for the added features.

I got the deluxe version because it has those grooves so pieces can't slip around. My only complaint is that this game looks a little tacky. I think the one my mom used to have wasn't as plasticy looking. And that gripe is only because this game stayed in our home and  we are not giant fans of bright plastic. If this had made it to my classroom it would have fit right in :) anywho get scrabble you guys! It's fun for family game night and it sneaks learning in there too.",5.0
1925,B00JMCJGZC,R387JTSEJ70Q9U,This is the One!,"  Bought our first Scrabble game back in the 70's; we used it fairly often through the years.  Never really liked the fact that if you bumped the board the letters would skew. Fast forward to 2019.  Finally decided we'd had enough; I started looking at the alternative setups.  While the travel version had the raised lines to keep the pieces in place, it was too small for our tastes.  Then I spied this one.  BINGO!  It has wheels to let you rotate the board.  It has 2 drawers: one for the ""letter sock"" and one for the 4 letter ""trays"".  My wife likes the old wooden letter holders and I prefer the new curved ones, so we swapped out 2 from the old game then gave it to a young married couple.  They are teachers and are loving it.  Just keep in mind that the board can rotate; keep your beverages and letter holders out of the way.",5.0
1926,B00JMCJGZC,R1XRCOY35SF03M,Insult to Scrabble heritage,"  Tiles are crap. Letters do not align, which drives me nuts. Wood quality is balsa like, rough and unfinished. Stamped, not embossed.  Racks are cheap semi round plastic and slide around at slightest touch. Colors jave changed, triple is orange, not red, double is red, not orange.  Have uet to count tiles, but others report missing tiles.",2.0
1927,B00JMCJGZC,R28LKZ35YEYTZ2,Glad I Purchased It,"  Was hesitant to purchase due to some negative reviews about quality. Comes in a plain brown box. No quality control issues with my board or tiles. All the tiles were present in the correct amounts. All easily readable with some minimal variances from one tile to the other. The letters are printed on the tiles, not etched into the tiles. The board is solid and turns on its wheels easily. The two drawers stay closed when turning or carrying the board (which folds in half, play side in). Easily carried. Room in the drawers for the tiles, the rules, the stands, and enough room left over for a small pocket pad of paper and a pencil. Glad I purchased it.",5.0
1928,B00JMCJGZC,R1JY8OQ1W3GLZU,Flimsy,"  I was so disappointed when I got my new Deluxe Scrabble board. It's sure NOT like the one they made some years ago...... the board is cheap plastic, smaller super light weight pieces.... the turn table does not turn easily. The letter holder is cheap plastic that could blow over if you breathe on it....I  wish I didn't buy this; if I'd known I would of preferred to purchase a used OLDER Deluxe game.",1.0
1929,B00JMCJGZC,R32DBZZP2M7GSQ,A Classic!,  A must have! I love that the case itself opens into the actual playing board and each letter fits in a groove to prevent shifting. The hide away drawers to store letters and chairs in between games are also a plus for me.  As well as the wheels on the bottom.  This allows each player to spin and view the board from different angles.  So happy with my purchase.,5.0
1930,B00JMCJGZC,R131K5SF18V4NM,Great implementation of a classic game!,"  This is a great packaging and implementation of classic Scrabble. I love the design of the board.  It is ""gridded"" with ridges to hold the tiles in place, which is great for locations where there are vibrations (think boat/car/RV). The drawers are very handy for storage, and my favorite feature - the wheels! The entire board, when placed on a hard, flat surface, will rotate easily on the built-in wheels. This is great for passing the turn to the next person and allowing them to read the board head-on. When unfolded, the board is stable and can be picked up on one half without the second half overextending and folding down. The board opens and closes easily, but stays closed when it needs to and there's a built-in handle for carrying. My one complaint, but barely worth mentioning is that it is a bit bulky. Not great for travelling on a plane/train, but great for RVs, boats, or just going over to a friend's house for a game.",5.0
1931,B00JMCJGZC,R3CST1MAK62X9E,Underwhelmed by the quality for the price,"  I love the game but have always owned the least expensive cardboard box with the simplest board. I decided to gift myself a deluxe Scrabble Game and suffered from sticker shock. For the price I was expecting the board to be sturdier, heavier quality material. I like that it spins and the I like that the grid on the board keeps the pieces in place but you get that with most Deluxe editions. I would recommend spending a little more money on a higher quality or stick with the good old fashioned simple box game.",2.0
1932,B00JMCJGZC,R10QR5Q9YS46RC,The rectangular size is a bit cumbersome,"  I did not like the shape of the board in use. Although it spins quite well, the oblong shape doesn't work well on square tables. I am also not to crazy about the curved tile holder and the cheap plastic it is made from.On the plus side, the tiles hold in the groves well and the unit opens well and is easy to transport. I als like the two trays to put the tiles and trays in.",3.0
1933,B00JMCJGZC,R30H8K2HU3BH2S,Overall cheap but nice,"  Build quality is not great.  I can see this breaking if dropped once.  However, the board is nice.  The chip inlays make it nice and clean rather than the chips being everywhere and constantly fixing them.  The trays are cheap just like the board, but they are curved.  Overall this is maybe a 15.00 product, but the concept is nice.  They are definitely ripping people off on price.  I would not buy this again or recommend it, unless they dropped the price.

This has the spaces for the letters to remain in place. The storage areas for the letters and individual player letter holders is a plus.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is for the quality of the board, the trays for the letters aren't as high a quality.  The 'old school' wooden trays were better.",4.0
1935,B01EIKRP0K,R29WK9A7Z9KWDY,Fun Co-Op Deck-Building Game featuring Harry Potter Characters!,"  Just a quick little spoiler-free review to say my husband and I love to play Harry Potter: Hogwarts Battle!I saw it at our local game store and thought it was a gimmick at first -- just another way to make money off a much-loved franchise -- but then I read the back description.  Our favorite tabletop games are co-op (Forbidden Island/Desert, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Mansions of Madness, Time Stories, etc.), and we also enjoy card/deck-building games (Dominion, Legendary games, etc.), plus I love the Harry Potter series (my husband is okay with it), so we took a chance and bought it.  We now play it every night after we come home from work!The gameplay reminds me of Dominion mixed with any Legendary game, but more fun because you play as specific characters -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, and/or Neville -- and battle though seven increasingly difficult ""games"", each representing a book/movie in the series.  Each game has a set of Locations, Dark Arts, Villains, Hogwarts cards, and other components, such as dice or upgraded character cards.  Beat Game 1, then add Game 1 cards to Game 2.  Beat Game 2, then add Game 1 AND 2 cards to Game 3, etc.  This is a 2-4 player game, so for a two-player game, I recommend each person play two characters to get the full experience.  My husband plays Ron and Harry, and I play Hermione and Neville.The basic premise is to work together to protect Locations from Villain Control and defeat all the Villains.  You lose if all Locations fall to Villain Control, but you win if you defeat all Villains.  Dark Arts and Villain abilities will hurt and hinder characters every step of the way, so building a strong deck of Hogwarts cards and playing to your characters abilities is essential.  The first two games are warm-ups, then the real difficulty kicks in on Game 3.  By then, your characters WILL get ""stunned"" (lose all health) at least once per game.  But that doesn't mean the fun is over, you just take penalties and keep on fighting, so you don't have to worry about someone sitting out of the game and waiting for everyone else to win.In terms of production, this game is the highest quality of all of our tabletop games.  Everything is in full color.  Each Game is individually boxed, and each set of Location, Dark Arts, etc. cards inside are sleeved separately to avoid confusion.  All cards are clearly marked by Game number or the character they belong to if they're starting cards.  In addition to the easy-to-understand 14-page instruction book, each Game has it's own little instruction booklet to easily guide players into setting up the next game and refreshing everyone on rules.  The cards are smooth and feature fantastic art from the movies.  All the cardboard tokens and components are sturdy and already cut out (except Game-specific tokens), and there are even cool metal skull tokens and four beautiful, clear Hogwarts House die inside.  The game box itself is sectioned logically for each game component and even leaves extra space if you want to sleeve your Hogwarts cards.I highly recommend this for anyone who likes co-op tabletop games, deck-building games, and/or the Harry Potter series!",5.0
1936,B01EIKRP0K,RV7O0W9QBNYFW,"They got it right!  Definitely earned an ""O"" on their N.E.W.T.'s!","  I hesitated to buy this game because I've been disappointed in Harry Potter games in the past.  They seemed to rely on the HP theme and didn't put enough effort into actual game play.  I'm happy to say that USAopoly and Forrest-Pruzan Creative have knocked it out of the park!  Or ""castle,"" if you want to go there.This is a cooperative deck building game that has 7 Games that build on each other.  Kind of a neat concept.  (I'm not talking about expansions you have to purchase - everything is included in the box.)  You and the other players play as Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Nevile.  The object is to defeat the villians (Draco, Quirrel, Lucius, etc.) before the villians take over all your locations. That's the object of the first 2 Games, at least.  Because, just like the novels, this game builds on itself 7 times.  Game 1 is complete in and of itself, but adding the material of another Game box will change it in certain ways.  One of the Game boxes add dice...to a deck building game that starts with no dice.  I can't wait to get there!The board, cards, and tokens are all very good quality. Nothing is flimsy or wanting. The Dark Mark tokens are stellar.  Molded in metal, they have a heavy weight and definitely add to the ""wow!"" factor with this game.  After you play each Game box, the cards can be separated out again, or left together by type.  (Game 1 has 2 villians, Game 2 adds 3 more, etc.)  The game developers thought ahead and even gave us organizer cards if you want to keep everything all mixed together (all the villians together, all the Dark Art Events together, etc.) once you've cracked the box and moved up the Game ladder.Because of the Game 1-7 add-on feature, this is an excellent intro to Eurogames.  It starts off really simple but ramps up after you get used to the mechanics.  One of the great perks is that if you have kids just now reading the books, you can play this game with them up to and including the Game box for the corresponding book.  That way it's completely relevant to them and nothing is given away for the later books.Harry Potter is very special to me for personal reasons that go back to 1997.  I was an original fan.  My hat is off to the developers for creating a solid, enjoyable game for diehard fans!",5.0
1937,B01EIKRP0K,R2O7N8KV5EO5KO,Well produced and thematically-enriched deck building game,"  *Important notice for people purchasing the early first runs of this game. There was a printing error which lead to 4 copies of a card called Confundus being put into the box (2 in box 5 and 2 in box 6 I think). The two Confundus! cards in box 5 were supposed to be two copies of Stupefy! which are missing from some peoples game, including my own. You can contact USAopoly customer service to get replacement cards:usaopoly.com/game-care-customer-service-inquiryThis is a highly entertaining game that was well worth the purchase and should be enjoyed for some time to come. I've played with just two and multiple games in groups of four and it's entertaining with both.As a quick summary -  I enjoy deck builders and this is a solid addition to our collection. If you like deck builders, particularly co-operative ones like Legendary Encounters: ALIENS, and enjoy Harry Potter this seems like an inevitable purchase. It also works as an easy way to introduce people to deck building mechanics which should work nicely for families, just be wary of small spoilers for children that haven't read through the books yet.For a more detailed breakdown of my thoughts so far:-The game evolves as you play through the chapters/games. The game has a built in tutorial for the first few games where it introduces you to the general mechanics of deck builders and the basics of this particular game. As you progress through each chapter you essentially continue to add more villains, more purchasable cards and more Dark Arts Events. If you're familiar with deck builders or are a savvy bunch you could easily start on game 4 or 5. The cards are all marked for which game they belong to so that if, at any point, you want to reset the game back you can easily do so. Game 7 represents the ultimate full form of the game with the full complement of villains, Dark Arts Events cards and the couple other unique features introduced throughout the entire series including game 7.-The game will get longer as you progress through chapters. You continue to add in villains with each chapter meaning the number of villains that you need to defeat is also increased. People have suggested on Board Game Geek that it plateaus out at about 1.5-1.75 hours with the very first game maybe being half an hour.-It both does and does not follow the events of the books and movies. As you progress through chapters it will introduce villains and Dark Arts Events from the Harry Potter series. However the game doesn't really try to tell a story and most of the villains don't come up in order. As a result it doesn't really give away major pieces of the plot. Regardless if you have a child that is reading through the books currently the best suggestion would be to only play through the games that they have read up to (game 1 matching roughly to book 1) mainly so they can relate to the villains and Events that occur. If you want to play beyond that point you can also look through the cards and maybe just remove those cards that you think might give too much away.-The game tends to be a bit harder with 4 people than with 2. Some of the Events and villains affect all characters simultaneously which makes the game slightly harder for a full group. I think overall it balances well for two players still since you also have less hero powers to make use of. It may not be the most difficult co-operative game out there, but make no mistake, the game can kick your butt pretty well depending on the villain order. You need to carefully balance damage output, heals and removing villain influence.-There is no player elimination. I don't like player elimination, especially for semi-long games. This game handles that aspect nicely, there are still health pools to track for the characters but when you hit zero you aren't eliminated. Instead you discard some cards for that turn and it helps the villains, but you are not eliminated. You bounce back to full health for the next turn. If everyone keeps getting stunned every other turn, however, you will lose. So you still need to be careful-Production quality is quite good. The pieces are all well done. The theme flows through all the cards and pieces. Overall the game mechanics, theme and cards just simply work. Very nice box and board. It feels like the designers are true fan of the series-Several groups of friends already want to play this game just from seeing a picture posted online. It has that excitement factor just looking at the game, which I think is a huge plus.-Setup and game play is quick. You can set up a game in under 10 minutes and get going. Turns tend to be straightforward and are quick to resolve.The game is easy to teach. The rules are easy to understand and everything is basically explained on the cards themselves. This helps immensely with teaching the game and being able to just play rather than making sure you have all the rules just right before each turn. This is a fantastic gateway game since you can modify the difficulty level while still introducing some major designer game concepts (like deck building) to a group. The co-operative nature of the game means you can actually help other players without ruining the game.So should you buy it?If you already own a ton of designer board games (Think like 20+ especially deck builders or maybe cooperative games). You may not get a ton out of this particular game unless you want/need the Harry Potter theme or if the game mechanics are drastically different from anything you already own. I think this game does what it does well, but nothing is especially groundbreaking. For these people that already own a lot of games I'd suggest waiting to see online plays or for reviews to come out from your favorite reviewers before purchasing. Rahdo has a nice run through of this game and Dice Tower has also covered it just to name a coupleFor those that have more limited designer game collections. Are you looking to try out (or think you might like) cooperative board games? Are you looking for a good introduction to deck building games? Do you love the Harry Potter universe or have family members that do? If you answer yes to all of these it's an obvious purchase. If you answer yes to even one it's also probably a great purchase.I bought it because I love cooperative games and there are limited cooperative deckbuilders. For me and my relatively small collection of games it ranks right up there along with my other cooperatives like Pandemic and Ghost Stories in terms of fun. It probably doesn't have the huge replay value of a game like Pandemic, but it also doesn't need to. I'm exceedingly happy with my purchase and the significant other is too, and that's all I really care about.",5.0
1938,B01EIKRP0K,R6NQJVV77IMYZ,"So this game is pretty fun, but suffers from some balance issues","  So this game is pretty fun, but suffers from some balance issues, I think. The game itself is actually divided into 7 different games, which follow the 7 books. Each game you get to play as one of the main characters of the book and all players work together to try and win. You play the games sequentially and the cards and characters follow the books thematically as you progress. Each new game adds new cards and gameplay elements that progressively make it harder and more complex. That part is pretty fun and the pieces are well crafted and fun to look at and handle.We found a couple problems playing through with 2 players - the first 6 games are way too easy. We felt like we were just going through the motions and never actually felt like we were ever in danger of losing. It wasn't that it was a bad game, there just was no tension or threat that you need to make a cooperative game interesting. Once we got to game 7 though, it did feel like it got harder, but honestly we still won with relative ease.So, we suspected that part of the reason the game was so easy was that we only had two players. So when we had the chance, we had a couple friends play with us, using all the pieces for game 6. We got absolutely destroyed, with not even a chance of winning. The problem was that on other player's turns your character can be negatively affected. With only one other player there's not really that big of an impact. With 3 other players you get absolutely destroyed every turn with all the negative things that accumulate. This seems like a huge balance issue in the game to me.Overall if you're looking for a nicely themed game with good production value, I'd say this is a good game for you. If you're more interested in challenging gameplay with sound mechanics, it might take some time to find the right balance, but may be worth the effort.",4.0
1939,B01EIKRP0K,R279XBLZPBFU9F,Best Harry Potter game ever and can hold its own with the majority of deck building games,"  If you are a deck building expert you may find the game play is not as good as the best deck building games but it is a very good deck building game.  If you are new to deck building games this is a terrific introduction with a seven step system that has a really easy entry point for books 1 and 2.  If you are a Harry Potter fan and even a casual gamer this is a must have.  In terms of implementing the theme of the series it is incredible.  The cooperative nature allows for a group of varying skill levels to enjoy the evening.  We play as a family with a non-gamer wife and gamer boys 8 and 10.  We have played it around 15 times though now we only play it as game 7 with all the bells and whistles.  I took it to my local wargaming club and they enjoyed it. Which is amazing as they hate cooperatives!  The games do often turn into runaway defeats or victories but I believe that is the nature of the designer choices which heavily favor random as opposed to scripted adventures.  There are many house rules you can pick and choose from Boardgamegeek to adjust the difficulty of the game or minimize the chances of a runaway. The game system is solid and so many of the best parts of the book show up it was addictive and bedtime was banished for a couple of weeks.  I really love that you add a little each game.  Very much a christmas morning feeling opening games 3 through 7. We paid about 40 bucks. One of the best gaming values in my 35 years of gaming. If you have any interest in designing a game for your favorite subject there are great lessons to be learned here.  I can't believe this was produced by a relatively unknown company, they punched way above their weight.",5.0
1940,B01EIKRP0K,R3E9O7RKPEK1N9,"A suprisingly fun game, even for adults.","  This game is a deck builder that uses an ""Ascension-style"" card market (where the cards change every time one is bought), rather than a ""Dominion-style"" market (where the cards market is determined at the beginning of the game and doesn't change). If you're familiar with just about any deck builders, you'll be able to pick up on this game pretty easily. You start the setup by picking a character (Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville), each of which has a unique starting deck, and opening the small box that contains the cards for the game you are about to play.This game plays out in 7 ""books"", each of which are contained in their own card box within the big box. Each book is a single game. When you successfully complete a game by defeating whatever villains come with that book, you can open the next card box which slightly changes the game by 1.) adding or changing the villains, 2.) adding or changing the environments, 3.) adding to the types of bad events that can occur, 4.) adding more complex cards to the market, and 5.) changing the powers of the characters.The game isn't strictly a legacy game in that you mark up the board or rip up cards, but it does build upon itself from game to game. However, when you complete a book (which takes less than an hour, early games are less than 30 minutes), you can pack up the game for another time, or continue with the scenario right away. This makes the game perfect for squeezing in one quick scenario before bedtime without committing to 2 hours of play. It's easy to play previous scenarios again, if you so desire.As far as collaboration goes, the game is cooperative, but the actual collaboration is limited to helping a fellow player heal (you WILL take damage in this game from the bad guys) or helping them get a little extra money to buy cards on their turn, but these are mostly rare events, and only if you draw the correct card on your turn. Otherwise, most of the collaboration is in the form of table-talk. I wish it had a bit more interaction, but that would have complicated the otherwise simple and fun mechanics.",5.0
1941,B01EIKRP0K,R3P9N0HED8Z3JU,My wife and I prefer cooperative games and this has quickly become a favorite. The game system works really well and is ...,"  This is a really well-designed game that should appeal to players young and old. My wife and I prefer cooperative games and this has quickly become a favorite. The game system works really well and is easy to understand with game mechanics introduced over the series of 7 years that you play. You will encounter all of your favorite characters and items during the game and quickly come to hate the villains even more (you'll shudder when Bellatrix LeStrange or Fenrir Grayback appear. Not because they are evil, but because they are so difficult from a game mechanic basis).The game proceeds through 7 years each one a slightly more complex game. An important detail to note is that there is no continuity from game to game. You don't retain any abilities won from one year to the next. This is probably the thing most of our friends have commented on while playing.The game also does suffer a tiny bit from two problems. The wrong deal of starting villains can be impossible to beat and the only choice is to lose and start over. The second problem is that you build abilities by buying cards from a market. The market deal is random and it may start out as too expensive for anyone to buy anything and doom the players (there's even a creator suggested alternate rule to deal with this). However, these are minor problems in a great game (though we are busily working on house rules to introduce a way for players to hang on to improved abilities from game to game).The final point that I will mention is the actual cards and game pieces. They are a weird mix of extremely high-quality and junk. The ""stones"" are very nice metal pieces and the board is really well made. Other pieces share this quality. However, the ""galleon"" markers are junk and look really cheap (I'm searching for good quality galleons to buy right now to replace them). The biggest offender is the cards themselves. We've played through the game 3-4 full cycles (so that's 20-30 games) and the cards started to show serious wear on the edges during the first cycle of games. The printing is coming off the edges of most all of them. It's the most disappointing thing about the set.We would still recommend this to anyone who likes cooperative games (Harry Potter fan or not). It's very enjoyable and very replayable. It's a must buy.",4.0

1943,B01EIKRP0K,RNOL90Q7MBOB,"Solid, well-designed game which hits its target (Harry Potter fans that like teamwork and strategic deck building)","  This addition to my board game collection was with lower expectations, but it leaped over all of them and is a keeper.  However, I can see where there are limitations to its appeal.PROS:  solid introduction to deck building mechanic, approachable game for young players, good connection for spells and items, strategy and planning make a difference, cooperative (very important in my family!), a sense of progression through the years as the character cards get older and get a special ability, good Harry Potter world ""feel""CONS:  mediocre card quality (sleeves needed if seeing more play time than one playthrough/year), limited key characters (only Ron, Hermoine, Harry and Neville) and my daughter would have liked to have the option of other houses, slow start each year as people build their decks (would be nice to provide a ""carryover"" spell from a previous year, especially if you do very well), villains repeat from year to year, and some downtime between turns especially with more than 2 players.While I'm not a board game fanatic, I am definitely a board game player with an affinity toward games with strategy and theme--Lord of the Rings Living Card Game (sleeves fit this game) is what dragged me kicking and screaming into the hobby.  I have experience building decks, so this was an easy learn.  I would have skipped years 1 and 2 but it was my daughter's first time playing a deck builder.  She picked it up quickly and loved the game (I would rate her a 4 out of 5 Harry Potter fan).Overall, this is a must buy if you are into medium weight board games (or like deck builders) and a Harry Potter fan.  If they have expansions (with other heroes from other houses), I would buy them.  However, if you already have a good deck building game, this will NOT oust it unless you like the cooperative bent or the theme.",4.0
1944,B01EIKRP0K,R3B27Q92ABIR6C,"Surprisingly Solid Licensed Game: Great for Novices and Experts, Especially Harry Potter Fans","  Bought this for my fiancee, as she's a huge Harry Potter fan, but not nearly as much into board games as I am, and I thought the co-operative, increasing difficulty might be a good hook for her.I was right. The game slowly eases into its rhythm, with seven different modules, each of which introduces new villains and attacks, as well as new spells with which to fend them off. There are new mechanics, too, with each of the four main heroes (Ron, Harry, Hermoine, Neville) ""growing up"" and getting personalized abilities in Game Three, and then learning proficiencies from their O.W.L. exams as of Game Six. Voldemort starts showing up as a rival around Game Five, and the number of villains and Dark Arts to contend with at once keeps increasing.Throughout all of this, the production design is outstanding, from the way the instruction booklet has slots to accommodate the ""new"" rules for each new ""year"" (game), to the actual tokens, from the ones that mark petrified foes and the weighty iron baubles that show how much of a locale enemies control. Movie fans will also appreciate that the familiar likenesses of these characters have been used for the art.The one issue I have with all of this, and where I have to dock a point, is with regards to the balancing of the game. It's meant for two to four players, but doesn't really scale: some of the cards and proficiencies that have effects applying to all characters seem underwhelming in a two-player game, and some of the enemy attacks are too powerful in a four-player game, in which you may constantly get stunned before getting a chance to take a turn. Randomness is a point of games like these, but certain enemy combinations are particularly frustrating (say, dealing with Lucius's ability to heal each time a location is attacked along with Pettigrew's odds of hitting a location). Moreover, with only six cards visible at once, all of which may be maddeningly out or your price range, you simply might not be able to ever mount a plausible defense. The game is largely nail-biting when it works, which is good, but you might need to add a few mulligan-like house rules of your own to keep things playable, especially with younger children.All in all, though, there's at least twenty hours of replay value in this box, and kudos to the developers for making it so easy to pack back up, with individual slots for the dice and dividers for each of the different types of cards. And while the deck building might be a bit frustrating (there's no way to get rid of outdated cards so as to streamline your deck for the endgame), and the meta-game might be a little cheap (leave the least harmful enemies in play all the way to the end), it's a great primer for newcomers, and a terrific opportunity for experts to share their passions in an enjoyable Harry Potter environment.",4.0

There are various game levels that become increasingly difficult to defeat.  The more we play, the better we become and developing a strategy for each player.  We work well together and have even developed a strategy for the types of cards each player should try to add to his/her deck.  Every time we play, we have a different experience.  Although my kids are older (22 and 25), I think kids as young as 10-12 could easily play this game once they understand the rules of play.I was not much of a game board player before we found this game.  Since then, we have been steadily adding games to our collection.  This game remains one of our very favorites to play.",5.0
1947,B01EIKRP0K,RTU5T2TYLQJA0,First real venture into co op board games.,"  Huge Harry Potter fan so seeing this pop up peaked my interest. I watched some videos and learned about the world of co op board games. Honestly my whole life board games to me were monopoly or trouble. So this has introduced me to a new aspect I never knew about. Everything is beautiful made and the game is fairly well put together. It has a progressive learning curve so you‚Äôre not thrust into a ton of rules from the get go. It‚Äôs kind of a learn as you go. The only complaint I have is I really wish this wasn‚Äôt the movie art and could have been the book art but alas it is what it is. If it was this would have been six stars for me. I really like how it‚Äôs set up into seven games and the way it all works you can kinda pick up wherever. Unless you‚Äôre going long haul you probably won‚Äôt do all seven in one go. So there‚Äôs a lot of playtime here. Overall highly recommend.Little update to the review:After quite a few times playing. We have realized a few things. First off the game is not perfect. If your starting villains have a effects that happen to trigger each other you have to stop and reshuffle. Second if your starting buy cards are all either expensive or not useful for starting game you have to reshuffle and start over. Third is you first few darkarts events cause you to lose the first location before beating any villains. Again reshuffle. It is absolutely impossible to win the game if your initial setup is triggering and your losing health and gaining locations tokens fast. That‚Äôs about the only ‚Äúproblem‚Äù we‚Äôve come to find. It‚Äôs a matter of recognizing quickly that ‚Äúyea we‚Äôre screwed‚Äù before trying to progress. Trust me you‚Äôll just waste 40 mins of the inevitable. But if you get a good setup to start, then the game is great. It‚Äôll have a bunch of ups and downs and stressful moments. You still will lose but at least you had a shot.One thing my wife and I have also learned is that Harry is easily the worst of the four. If you‚Äôre not playing 4 players don‚Äôt use him. The others effects are much better. Also while this makes the game take much longer we have found that if you use hermione to buy up a bunch of location token removals and give her the added effect to remove locations you can pretty much win every game. This strategy worked great in game 7. Again though this is the slower route but has a higher success.Overall after playing this a bunch of times now through each game, it has its flaws. It‚Äôs not a perfect strategy game as the randomness of the event cards easily upends that. But it‚Äôs alot of fun. You‚Äôll probably lose half the games you play but it makes the ones you win that much better.",5.0
1948,B01EIKRP0K,R1WEHNQU47FDCG,Excellent deck-building Co-Op - a few minor nuisances though,"  This game is a wonderful deck-building co-op game!Pros:- There are 4 character cards and enough proficiency cards that will randomize the game and add a level of difficulty.- Due to the shuffling of villain/dark arts cards, it's a different battle each game you play- The game builds on itself - great for beginner players to start on lower levels and work up to 7.  For those that understand deck-building, it was fun to go from 4-7.- Great balance between Villain effects and the reward for defeating a Villain.- Decent replay value - I've played 30 times and it's still fun as long as you randomize your starter character/proficiency cards.Cons:- The rule book doesn't cover some common questions:  Q: If you have a Weasley Hero card and another person is playing as Ron, does his starter deck count as having a 'Weasley'?  Q: If you play a card from you 5-card hand and it goes into the 'discard pile', and you get to pick a card from your discard, can you pick what you have played that turn?  Q: Does the Death Eater affect you as he initially comes out and/or does he affect you if he's the first Villain and two others come out?  Q: Are you allowed to discard a card in your hand in order to avoid the effects of horcruxes/Villains (eg: You have an Ally and the horcrux says that if you ""play an Ally..."")- You're hamstringed on 3 critical components of the game:  1. ***If the 6 starting (and subsequent) cards that come out for purchase don't contain 'remove from location', are too expensive (6/7/8 coins), or don't have 'dice-rolls', you can be off to a rough start. ***EDIT - the game developer released an optional rule starting that: ""Once per game, a player may forego acquiring any cards for his or her turn. If he or she does, take ALL SIX available HOGWARTS cards, and place them on the bottom of the deck, replacing them with six new cards"". This rule applies collectively to all players. So any one player can do this action ONCE per game. if a player chooses this option, no one else can repeat it until the next game""***  2. If the 3 Villains that come out initially work off of each other (can't gain heart, lose 2 heart, and if you add to location, lose 2 heart) you can be off to a horrid start.  3. Dice rolls - if you don't like relying on dice rolls, you'll need to in the later 'levels'.  If any of these happen to you, there's a great chance you'll lose.  In the games' defense, losing a co-op game is part of the fun/challenge.  Additionally, if any of these happen, the 1-hour game could turn into 3-hours.I know it looks like a laundry list of complaints, but very fun game and I'm looking forward to the expansion in August 2017.",5.0
1949,B01EIKRP0K,R3FC8WXM5BCORE,Perfect for board game fans & Harry Potter fans,"  My family plays a lot of board games and we are all Harry Potter fans, especially my daughter.  Once I began my search for a Harry Potter-themed game I came across all the usual franchise-money-grabs.  Just as I was losing hope I came across this game.  The reviews sold it for me.  This game is amazing; it‚Äôs not just some quickly made game to turn a buck or a previously released game wrapped in Harry Potter robes.  It‚Äôs a legit good game.  The game is difficult enough to keep us on the edge thinking we will lose but the tide always turns by the end.It is a co-op game where the players work together to defend Hogwarts against the Dark Arts using a clever drafting system.  The first time we only played Game 1.  I thought it was too simple and was having second thoughts on my purchase but I was happy my daughter liked the game.  The next night we played, we only stopped because it was getting too late.  The genius of the game is how each ‚Äòlevel‚Äô or Game increases in difficulty and complexity.  New cards (spells, items, and allies), villains, and locations are introduced as well as new elements like dice and upgraded characters.The box is designed to hold the cards in an organized fashion after each box has been open.  To play through a previous level/game all you have to do is a little sorting.  Since I have played it mostly with my daughter we have gone back to play the other levels with the rest of the family.My only complaint is I wish there were more characters to choose from.  In this game, you choose between Harry, Ron, Herminie, and Neville.  The expansion includes Luna so I‚Äôll be picking that up.I haven‚Äôt tried yet but I think this game would be fun played solo as well.",4.0
1950,B01EIKRP0K,RK7W7TAGVH49X,Missing Cards,  This game was missing the Heromine cards which makes it impossible to play with four people. I ordered six weeks ago and since it took more than 30 days before I played I can‚Äôt even contact the seller for replacement cards. All I wanted was to play the game I bought!,1.0
1951,B01EIKRP0K,R3HQ163B65VN0I,Obsessed With This Game,"  I have an obsession with this game. I am a big fan of strategy board games, and this is probably my favorite right now. When I want to introduce it to my other nerdy board-gaming friends, I describe it as a mix of Pandemic and Dominion.Pros:-Cooperative (everyone wins or everyone loses)-Has different levels and ways to make it more or less challenging. My husband and I play it together, or with friends on the harder levels. We play it with our kids (ages 8 and 6) on the easier levels.-My emerging reader can even play it to some extent because it is cooperative. He has his cards out on display, and we can tell him what to do. This doesn't work as well with games where we are competing. It works great for a cooperative game.-There are so many variations on each game, depending on which villains you play against first, which cards are available to build your deck with, etc.Cons:-Instructions are not incredibly detailed, so there are a lot of things that we just have to just make our own house-rules about.-Setting it up and putting it away can be time-consuming because there are so many parts.-It takes a while to learn to play it well enough to do so quickly. It is not a game I teach to many friends because the learning-curve is a fairly steep one.",5.0
1952,B01EIKRP0K,RVFX3D6LBVJD5,SUCH a GREAT game!!!,"  I had been looking at this game for a while, but I wasn't sure if it would be very fun or have high replay value. I had doubts if a game that was so steeped in branding could be worthwhile. We own a LOT of board games, and enjoy a large variety (Catan, Clank, Ticket to Ride, Kingsburg, Above and Below, Galaxy Trucker, Killer Bunnies, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Terra Mystica, Dominion, etc), so we have a pretty high standard for what is fun. I read lots of reviews, watched a play-through, and still couldn't decide. I ended up getting it for Mother's Day (#SayNoToFlowers), and it has been SO fun!! I played through the whole thing (plus the expansion) with my husband, and we love it!!! This is a pretty straight-forward deck-builder, but with the added geekiness of Harry Potter!! It has seven boxes inside containing cards and other pieces for at least seven separate games, and *accurately follows the seven Harry Potter books, while using photos from the movies (*exceptions include a villain card of Malfoy in the first box that shows Malfoy much older than in the first movie- there are a few cards like that). The game adds elements that make sense which each new box, the characters you use improve, and it's gets harder to beat the game. I love cooperative play and deck building and HARRY POTTER so this game is a no-brainer favorite for me! The added bonus is that my husband likes it just as much (he said it's better than Marvel Legendary) so we will be playing it often!! (Unlike Clue...*sniff*) We both have favorite characters to be (him: Neville; me: Ron) Some of the levels took multiple times to beat. It's a great two or three player game (we haven't played with four people). The other great thing is that my nine year old can play with me (only through the books she has read, because there are some spoilers) and it was easy for her to learn. Now that we have opened every box, there are some suggested ways to mix up the game, as well as ways to make it harder, if you want, so there is infinite value in replay! Oh, and the game includes a system to sort the cards as well as space to keep them all organized in the box! GREAT game!!!",5.0
1953,B01EIKRP0K,R1RKQ94G9U2196,Fantastic game and excellent customer service,"  My husband and I love this game.  It's engaging and practically begs to be played.  We have lost a couple times, but that hasn't been a deterrent to playing.  The game play is simple in the first games and gradually adds on more complicated elements as you advance.  This is nice in that, not only does it follow the idea of you gaining in wizardry power through the years, but also it makes the game easy to learn.  I like that I can find a youtube video on how to play a game if I have trouble following the rule book, but it's nice that I didn't have to do that with this game.  The instructions were well-explained and the game is set up in a way that didn't make me feel like I needed to revisit calculus.  Basically, it's a good game without seeming unnecessarily complicated.After we played game 4, I realized that our game 5 Dark Events cards were missing.  I shot an email to the company and received an envelope in the mail with the missing cards just four days later, with a bonus card included as an apology.  Any company that will assist their customers so quickly is one I want to buy from again.",5.0
1954,B01EIKRP0K,R1BBYVWT7W4UC1,"Lots of fun, some complexity, game made mostly of great quality materials.","  So far we've only played 2 of the 7 games included (each game includes extra cards, mostly to be mixed with the cards of the previous game), but this has already been great fun. I feel like setup (especially first-time) is a little tedious and the cards come in an insane number of small bags (this is to help you sort them for the first game at least, so, don't do what I did and just shuffle them all together or you'll have to sort them out by hand). There are probably 10 different subsets of cards (they are all labeled, just takes a bit of getting used to).Once you get rolling, the gameplay is fairly quick. You'll probably want to play more than one round, though, so you can take advantage of being already set up. Being a co-op game it's great for kids, everybody gets to be on the same side and the ""forces of darkness"" are symbolized by a few villain character-cards and some nasty spell cards.So far the game seems very true to the movies (no spoilers). My daughter is very into the lore and pointed out that, even though there are 7 games (supposedly following the 7 books) some characters who don't make it through the first book will still be in play in game 2. She also noticed that some of the photos for the game 2 cards are taken from later movies. This didn't harm the gameplay at all, and didn't upset her much, just required a tad more suspension of disbelief.The bad guys damage the heroes and take over locations (cards with nice screengrabs from the movies) through spells that they cast each turn (also cards with movie-quality pictures). The heroes (the 2-4 players) play Harry, Hermione, Ron, or Neville. Players track health using cardboard tokens on a track, and the villains track their control of the locations using small but fairly hefty metal tokens. Players build abilities by purchasing spell and item cards with cardboard ""influence"" tokens.Almost all the characters from the movies are in the game, all as photos of the original actors, so, everyone can be righteously on guard when, say, Lucius Malfoy's card turns up, or happy when Trevor or Crookshanks dispatches a foe. Another big part of the fun is imagining yourself casting spells. There are lots of fun ones (although, for some reason, the game is chock full of comparatively unexciting Alohomora (unlocking) spells). If you or your kids aren't into the books or movies, then the game will seem less fun. Also, the villains use the same ""dark mark"" skull symbols as shown in the movie and a certain dude-who-must-not-be-named is pictured in full bad-guy makeup, so if your kids are young enough to be scared by that, you might want to wait on getting this game. (For that matter, the metal tokens are easy to swallow and the game is all about magic spells (some of which wound characters, though there are no graphics of this), so there are plenty of reasons to keep young kids at a safe distance.)The look and feel of all the cards is great. I wish the tokens were all metal, stone, or a nice plastic, and I wish the few which are metal were of a more interesting shape, but those are very minor gripes. All-in-all, its a great game for game night with your Harry Potter fans.",4.0
1955,B01EIKRP0K,R2TYJ3EFCQIEVK,Missing dice,  I received the product today eager to play with my children.

1956,B01EIKRP0K,R36J1TSXNTHUMI,All HP fans must own this.,"  So addicting! It takes a round or 2 to really understand how to play but then it becomes hard to quit and put it away! We bought this for our 9 yo son. He loves it but my husband and I are totally hooked, too. While most enjoyable for Potter fans, you don't need any knowledge about the series to play this. We love the cooperative aspect of it. Win as a team or go down as a team. Take note that it is not a quick game to get through. For example, one round of Game 6 with 2 players took 2 hours. Our son has a hard time staying on task and remaining focused but this is not a problem for him while we play!There are some instances when we are unsure of a rule in a specific situation and cannot find an answer in any of rule books. Ie: Can we place the Petrificus Totalus spell on Voldemort when he is not the only remaining villain? We just improvise and end up creating our own (moderately challenging) rule to continue play.",5.0
1957,B01EIKRP0K,R16U8VJL4I6LSX,Fantastic game! Fun to learn and to play!,"  This is an AMAZING game. I loved it from the first time I played it, and have since introduced 7 more people to it, some of whom have even bought it themselves since then. :) It's easy to learn, easy to follow, and fun to play. I highly recommend it to any tabletop gamer who is even just a casual Harry Potter fan.That said, my Year 3 cards are a mess. Seven of them were misprinted (some even on the wrong size card stock) and/or mis-cut. As for the character cards (which contain information absolutely crucial to game play): The cards were mis-printed so badly that the information on them is undecipherable, leaving the cards - and therefore this and future Years of the game - unplayable. We were about to start Year 3 and had to stop because we cannot read the character cards.(Year 7 is fine except for the cardboard tokens, which aren't printed well for where the machine stamps the cut lines. It's fine, the tokens are just a little mangled. Totally playable though. No serious issue, just want the manufacturer to be aware so they can adjust their settings.)I'm still giving this game a 5-star review because it's great - for play, appearance, price, timeliness of shipping, etc. - and I'm assuming the messed up cards are an anomaly. But I will definitely be pursuing Year 3 replacement cards because what I was sold leaves the game unplayable beyond year 2 out of 7. I'll update with the seller's resolution.",5.0
1958,B01EIKRP0K,R1F1ID9AAURW36,Great game to play casually with friends or family,"  This game is just amazing; it's easily in the top 3 for our household.  It's so exceptionally well designed, weaving the theme of Harry Potter into the gameplay.  It would have been easy for the designers to just make a generic card game and slap Harry Potter graphics and text on it.  But they actually put a lot of effort into designing the abilities, play, etc around the Harry Potter theme.To give a great example: Crabbe and Goyle.  They're a Villain in this game which are easy to deal with and don't do much damage to you.  My family and I developed a strategy where we would just leave them around on the board as long as possible, since they were so weak and easy to play around.  Eventually we realized ... that's exactly why Crabbe and Goyle are in all the movies/books!  They provide a ""villain"" in the stories without being an actual threat.  Very funny.  But that kind of weaving of how characters play in the game is presenting in the design of all the cards.The game is easy to learn and play, so it's great for families and friends who don't have the patience for more ""hardcore"" board games.  Some of the people we play with are down with hardcore games, but not everyone is, which often makes it hard to have larger gaming get togethers.  This game is perfect because anyone can pick it up and have fun with it, but it isn't so easy that it isn't interesting to play.  It still requires thinking, strategy, and working together.  You just don't have to deal with a novel's worth of complex rules.To top it all off, it's a coop game, so no one feels like they're losing.It's basically the perfect game for groups.I really hope the makers of this game apply their skills to other movies/books!",5.0
1959,B01EIKRP0K,REC300VSYCAHA,"Fun fanciful game, and you can speed it up easily if needed","  We are playing with one younger child and finding the games super charming and fun but they go on too long. To fix this we start in about 2/3 of the way into the game (we are on game 3). So we use it the last location, 4 villains, and randomly add 5 or more Hogwarts cards to each hand. This also allows more use of the special fun cards by all players (like Dumbledore might show up) and allows the heroes even footing even if you end up with the hardest villains first. Most importantly we can finish before bedtime and it's just as fun. Just an idea if you are having the same problem!As an update, both boys love this game so much, it's definitely the most time they spend nicely together during this shelter in place. We don't bother shortening the game anymore because it's a staple on the table ü§£. Now they are still starting with a few extra cards from the previous game but they also made up new villains to add. Even the one that can barely read is writing up a storm. If your family likes the books, don't hesitate!",5.0
1960,B01EIKRP0K,R2SWNVGGB7TUA1,"Addictive fun whether you‚Äôre a witch, squib, or muggle (or not even a fan of the series)","  The solid mechanics of this game make it engaging, complex, and almost as much fun to lose as to win. If you enjoy the books or movies it has a bit of extra fun, but no knowlege of the Potter series is required to become an effective player. I have played with kids as young as seven, but they are too young to really get deep strategy; to survive later levels, play after the young ones are sent to bed.  The game now appears on my ‚Äúbuy it again‚Äù list as a repeat purchase candidate because after playing it together I have purchased three more copies as gifts for friends.The game itself is well designed and offers increasing difficulty even for veteran players.  It is broken up into seven ‚Äúgames‚Äù that align with the books, and it is intended that you successfully complete the earlier games/levels before moving on to the next.  Since it is entirely possible you may need more than one attempt to get through a game, I want to issue a warning that a gaming session intended to end at 9 PM will quickly turn into parents realizing the roar of victory needs to be muted because it‚Äôs 1:30 AM.The cards have a mix of original artwork - including some inspired by characters or locations as rendered in the films - and photos of objects and actors as they appeared for movie fans.  One of the more frustrating aspects to me is that some of the most frequently used and shuffled cards are an uncommonly sized square for which I cannot find protective sleeves!The flow of the game generally goes like this: the bad guys are attempting to take over Hogwarts and if they succeed the good guys - you - are cooked.  Each player chooses a main character and receives a basic set of abilities, spells, items, and a helpful ally.  Players use these cards to gain power for attacks, restore health for themselves or other players, or influence to gain new spells, items, and allies.Of course, the game has to give the bad guys a chance, and it‚Äôs a better chance than you as players have of winning. Each player turn one or more dark arts events takes place that weakens characters, limits play options for the turn, or deals damage to the characters.  Whatever villain(s) is/are in play then have an opportunity to deal damage, weaken the characters, or otherwise increase the threat level.  You may have noticed the ‚Äúvillain(s)‚Äù comment.  As the game levels get higher or as the threat level increases - like when there are three locations at which you are expected to battle dark forces and they‚Äôve managed to take over two already - each player turn may require up to three dark arts events and your group may simultaneously be facing four villains, one of which is Voldemort himself!  Expect to play some levels multiple times.Play is easy to learn and individual turns can go quickly, but strategic coordination of turns (eg: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to leave Molly in case Neville can get six influence on his turn and I‚Äôm leaving the spells for Hermione, but I‚Äôm snagging Mad Eye to maximize my polyjuice potion next turn...‚Äù) can take a while to weigh out the options and can make all the difference.I cannot recommend this game more, and have yet to find a person who doesn‚Äôt play it and want a copy before the night is over.  Do yourself a favor and pick up your own set.",5.0
1961,B01EIKRP0K,R2HR2ACCDC6Y2R,This is my new favorite board game!!,"  Where do I even start?! This game is absolutely amazing! It is challenging, fun, suspenseful, sometimes frustrating, and all-around magical! It brings out our inner-geeks every time. This is the first cooperative board game we have played, but we love that we are working together and helping each other out for one common goal rather than each of us trying to win individually. Visually, the game is beautifully made. There are a lot of pieces to this game, but they are all well-made and store conveniently and compactly in the box. The directions are a little unclear at first, but once you start playing you figure it out pretty quickly. There are endless variations to the outcomes of each round, depending on how many people are playing, which characters you play, and the order of the way the cards are drawn and played. It definitely takes skill and strategy that you have to learn along the way. Once we start playing a round we are hooked for hours, because we just have to beat He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named! I have told many friends who love Harry Potter about this game, and their families have all gotten as hooked on this game as we have!",5.0
1962,B01EIKRP0K,R3M0I4WQFQNQQ3,One of the best board games I've ever played!,"  My husband, friends, anyone who I introduce this game to typically becomes addicted to it pretty quick. Even if you're not  a massive Harry Potter fan, the game-play is really fun. The first few levels are pretty easy to allow you the time to pick up how to play and then it builds quickly into a really challenging game. And even after several play throughs, we still will occasionally lose as its never the same game twice. Really good fun and quite easy to learn and set up. Cannot recommend this game enough and really wish they'd make it with other themes as well!",5.0
1963,B01EIKRP0K,R2B8QKSKVT6GLA,"Has some mechanical flaws, but still lots of fun","  I'm a big fan of cooperative games and deck-building games, and this may be my current favorite in the intersection of those two (I also really like Marvel Legendary, but the setup/takedown time on that is a barrier to getting it to the table, while this gets out of the box pretty quickly). I've already played through all 7 games several times, once as a group of 3 and twice as a group of 4 (with another play in progress), and everyone I've played it with has loved it. The Harry Potter theme is admittedly a big part of the appeal, so someone who isn't into the theme won't get as much out of it, but the game itself holds up well enough that it doesn't require everyone to be a big Potter fan to enjoy the game.There are a few mechanical problems to be aware of. My biggest complaint (and it's a big one) is that, especially once the introductory games are out of the way, the game ultimately comes down to location control cards (ones that remove control tokens from the location) -- getting a bunch of those early trivializes the game (as long as you're able to keep removing tokens quickly, nothing else really matters, and it becomes very easy to finish the game on location 1 with few or no tokens), and having no location control cards available early tends to doom you. The result is that most games are either runaway victories or crushing defeats (with the likelihood of these two outcomes depending on what year is being played), with relatively few close/tense games. Another problem (which sounds like it may be addressed to some extent in the expansion, which I have not played) is that there is no way to remove cards from your deck (a standard feature of virtually all deckbuilders), which combined with a fair number of underpowered cards available for purchase can lead the 6 purchase slots to become clogged up with useless cards unless someone buys cards they don't want (and weakens their deck in doing so) just to get them out of the way and allow new cards to come out.With that in mind, the game is a great deal of fun, and I highly recommend it to Harry Potter fans in particular (but not exclusively). This game does a better job than any other that I have seen in making every character seem essential because of their unique abilities -- that differentiation goes a long way toward making everyone feel useful, which is great in a cooperative game.",4.0
1964,B01EIKRP0K,RWDQGZ3QPFVK8,Disappointed,"  Best thing about the game is that it's a Harry Potter product.  Everything else is a let down.Several of the cards had super differently colored backs, which lets you know what cards are coming up next on your deck. Pretty disappointing to accidentally know what you're about to draw.  Looks like just really poorly done printing and no real QC?I only played through all of the games once and several of the cards are already torn and damaged even though we've been very careful with them, so they're pretty low quality.The board itself has several folds in the decal that's adhered to the top of it, so it's not smooth and cards get stuck randomly.  It doesn't look very nice, just looks like it was done cheaply in a hurry.As for the game-play itself, it can be frustrating.  Once you get into later games, it's way too easy for your first 2 or 3 villains to be really overpowered compared to the cards you have available at the start, and it's way too easy once you get to the end for the fights to become pretty trivial.  It feels as much like a game of luck as one of skill, which can be fun, but not really what I was looking for.Essentially, it gets 2 stars just for being Harry Potter, so if you're a super fan of the series, you may enjoy it just off of that.  Otherwise, it's just a poorly put together game with really low quality manufacturing and non-existent quality control.  Wouldn't buy again and wouldn't recommend.",2.0
1995,B00000IVFX,R3AFOCLBN81ROW,Super fun.  LOVE this.,  LOOOOOVE THIS.  Here is why.1. Easy setup.  Seriously.  It takes like 1 minute to set up.2. Easy to learn.  Again.  You can learn this game in about two minutes by reading the instructions...and about 15 seconds when someone explains it to you.3. FANTASTIC for large groups.  It allows everyone to play.  Especially this large size.4. It doesn't take a ton of brain power to play.  That's a GOOD thing since when we play this game...it's usually cards in one hand...cocktail in the other.5.  Camaraderie by playing on teams.  How fun is that!?6. Great for all ages.  Kids can play too!,5.0
1996,B00000IVFX,RECZXCK5CAEN1,LOVE this game! Wish I'd known about it decades ago.,"  I absolutely LOVE this game! We've been playing it for years. My only regret is that I didn't learn about this game decades ago. You won't regret the purchase. You'll have so much fun with this easy to learn & play, delightful family game. You can include the kids and enjoy it with just adults too. It's a GREAT TWO PLAYER game as well. We enjoy partners competition. We keep a running tally just for fun.Careful when choosing which version to buy. There are several different sizes of this game. I love the largest soft matt version. I actually leave it up on my game table under the glass table top to protect it. It looks like a bit of art deco. My first purchase was the small box version... way too small for comfortable play. Second purchase was the Jumbo Tube. That was the perfect size matt. But the tube is too big. Then I saw the box version of the same jumbo size soft matt and bought it for my week ends away. I don't store it in the box (except for travel). I kept it rolled up in a drawer so it lays flat when playing. If your looking for the largest jumbo matt read the descriptions carefully & see the game description that tells you the exact inches. It's easy to buy the wrong one. It's worth the price! Have fun!",5.0
1997,B00000IVFX,R3162F2AV2NVNK,A Fun Game for Family or Friends,"  Once you read the instructions and get use to the game play, which is simple, this is a nice game. There were six of us playing so we followed the recommendations and had two teams of two people. Using the team concept is required when their are over 3 people playing, as you have only three colors of chips. Teams are made with  every other person around the table, so each team gets two chances to form a sequence. Each chip has two side. One is plain and one has some white writing on it. You use the plain side up until you make a sequence then you turn the ones making the sequence over. I mention this as I wish the writing was a bit bigger and whiter. A minor thing but a suggestion. I would definitely recommend this game for a family or group of friends.BTW, 4 Stars is my highest rating as I do not ""love"" things. When will Amazon change the highest rating to ""Excellent"" rather than "" I love it""",4.0
1998,B00000IVFX,R1IHYXKVY0QOPS,"It works great, I always take mine to parties and other ...","  Everyone loves the Jumbo Sequence Mat.  I already had one, which My husband had put between 2 pieces of flexing glass that is about 1/16 inch thick each.  He laid the mat between the 2 pieces of flexing glass and we use Clear 2 inch, Heavy duty, packing tape, neatly around the edges to hold together.  It works great, I always take mine to parties and other people have done this, after seeing and playing on my board.  It is a little expensive, Our local glass store will cut it the exact size you need.  It cost about $40.00 for the Flexing and You know what the Jumbo Mat cost.  But it will last forever and is really easy to clean and play on.  I got this one for a friend and of course, she put the flexing glass on hers.  We love the game, great game for large groups.  We play teams.",5.0
1999,B00000IVFX,R3EUDPPO16QF89,Chinese Knockoff?,  This particular product is a Chinese knockoff.  Took almost one month to arrive from China and was badly damaged in transit..  This set is way overpriced....contains about $2.00 worth of material.  The Chinese did copy the original game instructions pretty well....grammar and syntax are somewhat accurate. This is a classic example of unfair Chinese trade practices that harm U.S. companies.Wish I would have paid closer attention before ordering.

It is hard to reach if you have short arms but that doesn't hinder the game at all. I highly recommend it for older people. My friend had the small version and we had to strain to see it. So, I thought I will buy this just to see if it is better. It had mixed reviews. I say BUY IT...",5.0
2001,B00000IVFX,R21AGMEZ31GOKP,I love the bigger board,"  I love the bigger board.  I was able to get the folded creases out of the mat by placing the mat face down on my ironing board, placing a t-shirt over the fold, spraying a little water on the t-shirt, and ironing it on the low silk setting.  It came right out and did not damage the mat.  Of course, I will not fold it in the future.  However, when we first opened the box, we were hit with a very strong chemical smell that was nausiating.  Yes, this was before I ironed it.  The toxic smell has lingered for hours, and we finally put it in the garage to air out.  Hoping that we don't have to return it because of the smell.",4.0
2002,B00000IVFX,R2I6BZ6GUQRPRZ,Very nice product. Nice table top board game,  We play the game with friends a couple times a week. It is a game of strategy and visual acuity. Very nice quality soft vinyl table top playing mat. There are several complaints about the ridges where the mat is folded. Simple solution - lay it out flat on a hard surface and lay a warm damp towel along the fold and gently rub the towel along the ridge. Also let it lay flat overnight with a couple books on it. Worked great for me.,5.0

Will try ordering the one in the tub, perhaps the mat is heavier and  thicker.",2.0
2004,B00000IVFX,R2G02DUB918550,This is the size to get,"  Every time we play Sequence with friends, they want to know where we got this big size. If you are over 65,definitely buy this size. We have found people who don't like playing cards or games, really enjoy playing Sequence. It's easy to learn and you can talk while you are playing.",5.0

Bad design. They used to make this mat in a tube which was much better as rolled up but they discontinued it....dumb.,2.0
2006,B00000IVFX,R1186ZUPU6U3PH,Playing board is not a board,  I bought the box version of this thinking I would get a foldable board with it. Instead I got the flimsy one folded up inside.... it stays creased and makes it very hard to sit chips on where it is folded up. If I wanted that kind of board I would have bought the cylinder package version.... atleast that way it wouldn‚Äôt be folded.,3.0
2007,B00000IVFX,R1QA3QOTXVIFX2,What a disappointment!,"  What a bummer. The box arrived crushed. A sturdy box is a must when the game has lots of pieces (cards and lots of chips). The mat is merely a folded piece of felt with a light printing of the usual sequence board. I‚Äôm not sure how well it will flatten for game play, since it is folded in the box for storage. I‚Äôm a big Sequence player and was really looking forward to having a bigger ‚Äúboard‚Äù for larger family gatherings. This product does not meet the standards of the original sequence game. Very disappointed with the purchase, especially for the price.",1.0
2008,B00000IVFX,R32DOC9OY6TP5H,Disappointed with the vinyl version,  I rated this low because I really don't like the vinyl playing board. I looked all over for the hard board Jumbo Sequence game and just can not find it anywhere. I wish they would go back to making it. I would buy it in a minute. This vinyl never lays totally flat thus making it hard to keep the playing pieces in place. I am a little disappointed with this set.,3.0
2009,B00000IVFX,R33MB1D06YLNO4,Great board game highly recommend!!!,"  We love playing Sequence.  It's a great board game...very easy to learn and fun for adults and kids.  Everytime we play this game peoplego out and buy it!!!!  We bought this for camping and we had 8 adults all sitting around the table playing this summer.  We play in teams.Once you learn how to play and get better it can be very challenging.  This is by far our favorite board game and makes a great gift too.This is the larger ""mat"" version but you can get it also in a smaller board game size too.",5.0
2010,B00000IVFX,R1WVVU11Y2Y5EK,Only one complaint,"  Because the card mat has been folded in a box (an admittedly large box), the mat has a crease right down the middle.  We've tried to flatten out the crease by leaving the mat out at night with heavy books on it.  That has helped, but didn't completely eliminate the crease.  The edges of the mat turn up a bit, as well.But I love the game and we play it often.",4.0
2011,B00000IVFX,R3P2QIO6YIAFA8,Big Face,"  On the regular board, people who have a hard time seeing find it difficult to find positions for their plays. I always tell them to follow the suit they want to play, until they find the card they are looking for. There are two sequences of each suit.On the bigger board, the cards are easier to see making the game more challenging as people can find their plays easier. This makes the game more fun!!! As the person with the best eyesight is not always the winner.",5.0
2012,B00000IVFX,R37EMPSPIZ3I7Y,Fun board game!!,"  Gotta have this classic card game that involves strategy. The best art of the game is that you can play with as many as 8-10 people. This version comes with a cushioned board which will likely last for a long period of time. Please do not buy any version of the game that does not offer a cushioned mat (board). Go buy this! I am not happy with the price. I think this should be priced at $29.99 and NOT close to $50. I gave 4 star considering the value for the price. Overall, very pleased with this product. Would be a great gift for any teenage or adult birthdays.",4.0
2013,B00000IVFX,R18W0HHPHW5W9I,Sequence Large Mat,"  I am pleased with the game but for some reason, didn't expect the board to be an actual mat - I though it would be a larger sized board.  It is a pain to store as if you keep it folded up because it will always stay bumpy, so I keep it opened all the time and draped over the back of a couch!!",3.0
2014,B00000IVFX,R14TSJDU4W2FUE,Great!,"  I had the Jumbo Sequence round version for a while and while it was really nice and large, it was a pain to store. Its in this big jumbo round cylinder and it was always in the way. If you tried to stick it in a cabinet it took up so much room and it would be the only thing on that shelf.Now this one is perfect. Just as big but folds up so nice and neat. I have a little OCD about things being out and messy. A couple people mention its hard to flatten, but I haven't found that to be the case. The one in the round cylinder was harder if you ask me. It was always popping.If your on the hinge about the two, trust me, you'll love this one much better. I gave the jumbo one in the cylinder to family.",5.0
2015,B00000IVFX,R9W4KOS0OTJUJ,"Nice version, overpriced","  We bought the original game with the cardboard playing board.  And we have used it for several years.  Because all of us are aging, we bought the larger soft playing board.  It is much easier to see and use.  Recommend  it but I think it is way overpriced for what it is.  Just the same, it is a nice quality and makes playing more enjoyable.",4.0

2017,B00000IVFX,RZSHILJH9LUD0,Enjoy the larger board and larger chips. One disappointment soft board not lay ing flat initially,  This is a fun game we play often with friends. We had the smaller game which was difficult to play with four on a regular size table. The bigger game board was a good size but difficult to keep smooth which made placing the chips flat difficult. We purchased an acrylic sheet to place on top to hold it flat. That worked perfectly but it wasn‚Äôt cheap. Also the cards in our smaller game were a nicer quality so we changed them out. Everything works great now. We enjoy this game with friends.,4.0
2018,B00000IVFX,R1TPTEUFESXJ96,Awesome-- especially for those who struggle with the original.,"  We LOVE Sequence, and recently introduced my grandparents to the game.

2019,B00000IVFX,R25RWBKU6CEBKC,Love the game but I think the packaging is too ...,"  Love the game but I think the packaging is too much. I think all Sequence canvases should be packaged in a cylinder with the cards and chips. You have to keep the canvas rolled in order for it to lay mostly flat on a surface so once you open the box, you can't put the canvas back in the box since it will be creased which means you are just using this oversized boxed for two decks of cards and three bags of chips.",4.0

2022,B00000IVFX,R1049M3JWDWZFU,Great size and quality,  Great game. Love that it‚Äôs jumbo size. Easy to play in large groups. The mat comes folded in the box.

2025,B083XX769B,R34JIEGA85NASM,"A more steamlined, new-player/kid-friendly version of Betrayal.","  The headline says it all. This is the Betrayal that you know and love, but trimmed down a bit to make things easier to understand for beginning or younger players, as well as take FAR less table-top space.  We played three games tonight after receiving the game in the mail this afternoon.PROS:Having owned all of the other Betrayal games, I can attest to needing a massive play area to get things done, especially with a full group. This game has far less rooms so you can play on a smaller (read: card) table if you wanted.Combat and the way damage is taken is a more simplified.Players are no longer eliminated from the game, letting people play instead of sit on the sidelines.Haunts are easier to understand and trigger, with less innane rules, and all information is shared with all players . No more Haunts that leave you scratching your head and wondering why you lost. (Though, this is optional).The material the game is made from seems to be one that won't warp as easily as the older games (YAY!)You will be able to play this with kids, easily, and anyone who is a fan of Scooby-Doo will have a blast, every rule/action is explained clearly and a lot of the vague undertones of the first game are gone.CONSThere are less room tiles in total (25), but this lines up with the PRO of needing a smaller space. Personally, I don't consider this a con, but some might.OVERALL:If you or anyone you know is a fan of any of the Betrayal games, then you can't go wrong with this one. It's a tighter, faster version of Betrayal that anyone can pick up or join in on. If they're a Scooby Doo fan, then it's a given that this would be a fantastic gift.",5.0
2026,B083XX769B,RWQ7M1HBJDZZ9,Meant for kids. Not adults.,"  110% meant for kids. I've played all of the previous Betrayal games & this one is very much meant for non-gamers and kids. I do think they'd like it - but I don't think gamers who don't have kids will like it. They ripped apart the rules to be significantly more basic - we jumped straight to ""hard"" mode and beat it with literally 0 issues. Mega skewed towards the heros. Good for nostalgia if you like Scooby Do. Good for kids. Not great for adults who frequently play board games. Played the hard haunts and will probably never play again.",2.0
2027,B083XX769B,R1G98LFXJFDI0N,So much fun,"  As someone who has never played the original Betrayal game, this was super easy to learn and play with my wife, 11-year-old, and 9-year-old. Despite being really accessible, there is still a lot of depth and variety to the gameplay. Might eventually pick up the original base game after getting used to this one. Only complaint is that the stat tracking clips are very difficult to attach and slide on the character cards and have already started tearing them a bit after one round of gameplay.",5.0

I don‚Äôt know how anyone could possibly enjoy this game. It‚Äôs insanely complicated! Also, why on earth would any game that was supposed to be fun require you to have three books just to play it? We were hoping this would be a variation of clue but more ‚ÄúScooby-ish‚Äù and instead it was a giant pile of insanity.

We are all about co-op play or new strategy games and this checked most of the boxes. We‚Äôve never played any other betrayal games but we were Scooby fans looking for a new family game.It will take one or two plays to fully get the rules down without relying on the rule book constantly (and the rules can be tweaked for more advanced play!) We look forward to trying one of the other betrayal games with adults in the future.It does come with 3 books; the rule book alone is 12 pages. Don‚Äôt read the Haunts or Tome book or you‚Äôll ruin the fun! We‚Äôve played this upward of a dozen times with friends and then just us the 4 of us. Our 7 year old even enjoys it - with help. It does seem very difficult for the monster to win.,5.0
2033,B083XX769B,RQWU7XDYS3B8T,Good entry level game for younger players.,"  After 3 plays, I really wanted to enjoy this game but the haunts seem to fall flat.The rules have been simplified to make it easier for children to access it but I think the rulebook is kind of a mess. For such a simple game, I had a hard time finding certain rules which slowed down play.I played this with my kids, but the youngest is 18 and all are used to meatier games, so I'm not sure how children will enjoy it. If they get a good teaching of the rules, I feel like children will enjoy it.The way in which haunts are generated in this game weakens the replayability compared to earlier versions. Also, the haunts seemed to fall flat for our crew. (Which can happen in any game of Betrayal, but seem to happen more often here.)I enjoyed the way the Scooby Gang characters played out. Thematically, they were on point.This game feel like an entry level game that you get new players into for a relatively quick play and then quickly get them to other games. For the price, it is worth picking up to have in your collection, but for me I'd rather play a round of Betrayal at Balder's Gate.",3.0
2034,B083XX769B,RIKTCM7X6C21B,Pretty meh.  Good for kids I guess?,  I bought this thinking it would be aimed at adults.  I was wrong.  It's more of an intro-to-betrayal game.  Which is useful if you want to play with children.  My adult game group was not very impressed with this game as it's stripped down and streamlined to a degree that makes the game feel rushed. The theme is great and I believe had they made this more akin to it's predecessor and less as an introductory game it would have been a better game.  Overall buy it if you have kids.  Otherwise skip it as the Scooby theme alone does not save it.,3.0
2035,B083XX769B,R1V5HRAPX86NJ3,"Poor organization, horrible hit markers","  Love the game but the markers to track the brains/speed etc that are constantly moved throughout the game are a horrible design, difficult to move and tear up the cardboard pictures they are on.

If you're buying for the sole purpose of a brand new Betrayal game, then you will likely be disappointed as it is a very watered down version of the original board game, however if you love Scooby Doo, you will enjoy that each of the scenarios are based on actual episode from the original ""Scooby Doo! Where are you?"" cartoon! Would've loved if the characters were models like that of the original game, however it is overall aesthetically pleasing!For Scooby Fans, a must have game that I recommend for kids 10 and up or adults who love the show. For Betrayal fans, this version makes it relatively difficult to be the traitor so, I would suggest some personal tweaks such as removing scooby snacks or adding 1 to all types of rolls to balance out the difficulty.",5.0

2057,B072KD87TW,ROBN7HYNZTWIV,Fun Family Activity,"  We decided to take our daughters (ages 10 and 11) to a real escape room for Mother's Day this year. We wanted to give them a little practice first, so we got this game. Our girls enjoyed the Jumanji movie, so it looked like a fun theme. This game was outstanding! This set comes with 3 different adventures with a battery operated box that counts down your time, plays jungle sounds while you play, and alerts you if you enter the correct answers to move on or not. It starts with a small 15 minute introduction game to get you used to have to solve puzzles in a time limit. These were easy enough for my 10 & 11 year olds to mostly do on their own. They got the hang of it pretty quickly and wanted to jump right in to the next adventure! The other 2 included adventures are both full 60 minute games. These adventures follow the storyline of the newer Jumanji movie where you get sucked into a video game and have to find your way out. The next adventure was not as easy. It was quite doable but we did get hung up in a few places. All in all, I recommend this for a family game night. You can reprint all the papers you write on throughout the game from their website, so I did and repackaged it up for a friend to borrow and do with their family. Great feature from this set so it is reusable to share. One con is that if you use the box to time yourself, every time you put in a wrong answer, it takes away a minute from your countdown. That does not happen in real escape rooms. So we lost a few minutes that way and only finished with 37 seconds to go! I would prefer it not take away time. I recommend using your own timer also so you can accurately see what your real time would have been, but the box is needed to check your answers and sets some ambiance with the jungle noises as well. Otherwise, I found this to be put together nicely, has cute puzzles that even kids can help with and enjoy, and follows the Jumanji theme very closely.",5.0
2058,B072KD87TW,R16JUVCLHA02CD,This version of the game CANNOT be used with expansion packs.,"  This game itself was fun but it was not clear that the included game pieces would not enable playing of expansion packs. I purchased this expecting that the Chrono Decoder and keys would be the same as the original version of the game, but this version only includes 8 keys (versus the original version that includes 16). We got over halfway through the Funland expansion and then spent 20 minutes trying to resolve a correct answer because we only had half as many keys as we needed (so were missing a key to proceed to part 3). Very frustrating and disappointing experience. Why not just include the additional 8 keys to make this functional for expansion packs?",2.0
2059,B072KD87TW,R1V502U5EQ92K5,Played it once.,"  I purchased this game partly because of the movie. I seen in a lot of other reviews that they said that the game was falling apart ours did not. Though the middle part is really cheaply made plastic if you were to accidentally put your weight on it it would break without a second thought. You have to take the card and slip it under the reader to be able to read what is on the cards some people may have difficulty reading it. With three of us playing in less than an hour we were completely done with the game. We did have some fun though. It's now in the closet and we may never play it again, may just have been a waste of money.",3.0

2063,B072KD87TW,RJJVLV7N0HRXJ,Made me feel like a big dummy,"  I bought four of these (was I crazy?!) to use at my daughter's ninth birthday party so the girls could play in teams of 4. She loves the Jumanji movies and was so excited to try this out. Things might have worked if there were enough parents around to guide them. Definitely not for 9-year-olds to complete alone as the directions were confusing (they were meant to be to make it challenging). The timing factor made things stressful for them and cooperating in a group of four was just about impossible. And these are really smart (and maybe a little bossy) girls.  I had one leftover game we didn't use at the party so we tried it today. It wasn't impossible, but it took us way more than an hour. And though the timer continues to count if you go beyond the hour time limit, the machine shut off by itself in the middle of a clue so we couldn't check our answers. You can't run through the game ahead of time to be sure this would work for a group of kids since you'd then be tearing apart items and writing on the papers so it really is a one-time use game. And I admit, there were times we had three of the keys down pat, couldn't figure out the fourth, so we just kept guessing until the controller dinged that we had gotten the combination right.  Honestly, my daughter would not stop talking and making guesses during the whole thing that I couldn't concentrate properly! Lol! She was eager to try and didn't give up easily, but it was stressful even with just two of us working on it. I gave up after the fourth task and put my husband in charge of working the rest out with her. She kept at it and enjoyed it....even after 90 minutes.  Older kids might enjoy it, but even they might need a parent's help.",3.0

2068,B072KD87TW,RC8PPTKC7R0NE,I'd definitely buy it again.,"  Fluxx is my FAVORITE game. I have original Fluxx, Doctor Who Fluxx, and now Jumanji Fluxx. Jumanji Fluxx has the most durable cardboard box. It's beautiful. It makes a great gift for anyone who loves Jumanji and has time to play games. The biggest difference between the other Fluxx games I have and Jumanji Fluxx is that (because you get 3 lives in the Jumanji game) you can get eliminated and have to start over. (This also makes it easy for anyone to jump into a game at any time.) It adds an intriguing twist to Fluxx that I love. We will definitely enjoy playing this for years to come. I'm just wondering if they're going to create a Jumanji 2 expansion pack, now that Jumanji: The Next Level is out, because I would totally buy it.",5.0
2069,B072KD87TW,R1R6FFCZ1Q8KI6,Decoder stopped working quickly.,"  Although we enjoyed the game, we were only able to play it because we had an additional decoder from a different escape the room game. The decoder no longer worked after the first 15 min game. Kids were disappointed because the jungle sounds on this one are fun, but never responded when we added keys. Luckily the answers are on the hint cards. Will be asking for a replacement decoder. Hopefully customer service is not bad too. The game itself is pretty fun. Little easier than the 16+ games.",2.0
2070,B072KD87TW,R28P5WL2VTVQU9,Great variation of Fluxx,"  I was very pleasantly surprised by how well this game balances still being Fluxx but also fitting with the Jumanji theme.This game is clearly still Fluxx (same general principles and gameplay), but it has a few variations that make it interesting (the danger cards and meta rules, plus labeling some keepers as adventurers or animals).As with other versions of Fluxx, it's playable pretty much by anyone who can read. I play most often with my nieces and nephews 9+.One thing to know is that with the danger cards, players can be ""eliminated"" which is kind of like dying or getting ""out."" Some kids might get upset about losing all their cards, but at least until you get through the first draw pile, players come back after one full round, so they don't necessarily lose when they get eliminated.",5.0
2071,B072KD87TW,R265EZ00KSPFVW,Set up is hard and time consuming.,  There is so many small tiny pieces that even perforated they are super hard to tear out!

The 15 minute tutorial only took 7, and that was with letting the 7 year old do the main puzzle. Not very challenging. The second game was the hardest of the 3. Third only took us 35 of the 60 minutes. Since it‚Äôs only playable once, it felt like we wasted money on it. Unless you have pretty young ones playing with you, buy any of the others instead.",3.0

2085,B0792JY6G4,R2Q549FSQAVPN,Create a city full of critters to gain the most points before winter in this worker placement game.,"  Overview‚ÄîYou must create a city full of critters to gain the most points before winter in this worker placement game.Disclaimer ‚Äì Skip to the end for the ‚ÄúFinal Thoughts‚Äù to get a snapshot version of this review1 ‚Äì 4 Players. CompetitiveLength/Win Condition-The game takes right about 2 hours with 2 players and around 2 and a half with 4. To win you must have the most victory points at the end of the game, which happens after everyone is finished with their last turns during the autumn season. You start the game at the tail end of winter during the beginning of spring. During this phase each player takes turns either placing a little worker on the board to collect a resource or playing a card. To play the cards you need to spend the resources you have collected but these cards are critical to winning as you are building up your little critter town with them. Most all the cards have victory points attached to them of varying degrees and usually do something special as well. Once you run out of workers to place and resources to spend to play cards, you then progress the season for yourself, which allows you to bring all your workers back and collect more workers to play during the next season.Components /Gameboard‚ÄìThe components in this game are really where it shines. Let‚Äôs start with the board. It‚Äôs not your standard board shape of rectangle or squared. It‚Äôs kind of roundish with a notch at the bottom for a discard pile. The colors are really nice and vibrant and just pop out at you. There is also this really cool tree that you assemble that stands at the back end of the board. This houses a few extra event cards and your extra workers at the very top of the tree that you collect when you progress the season. Also within the trunk of the tree is the massive card draw pile. It‚Äôs extremely thematic and adds a TON to the overall appeal of the game. This does create a kind of issue with seating though as everyone that plays have to sit on one side of the table.  For me this was a bit of a hassle with 4 players as everyone was trying to build their own critter towns out and needs space. At 3 players or less though I would see it being much less of an issue.Apart from the gameboard the little resources are also very amazing. Let‚Äôs see you have twigs, pebbles, resin and berries. Each piece is completely different from the last. The pebbles are little oval gray plastic pieces, the resin are translucent yellowish plastic pieces. The berries are purple SQUISHY little berry pieces, ugh I love how they are squishy. The twigs are little brown twiggy looking things. They are probably my least fav of all the resource components and not because of low quality or anything, but because they roll around all over the place. I feel like they should have been grinded down on one side just to keep them from rolling all over the board when someone grabs some from the pile. Something else I will say is that the piles of the resources are a little messy. Now this is just a personal preference and I certainly won‚Äôt dock any stars for this but I think the game could really benefit from little storage cases for each resource on the board. I will probably look into this for myself.Box/Storage ‚ÄìThe box is gorgeous. It has some beautiful artwork adorned on the outside cover and it comes with a decent insert on the inside. The insert holds all the cards nice and stable and I haven‚Äôt had any mixed up components even storing the game on its side. There are other open spaces in the insert for the rest of the stuff but I would suggest getting little plastic baggies to separate all the components and keep them secure.Visual Appeal /Table Presence‚ÄìThis is another highlight of the game. All the artwork looks amazing throughout. I get excited to draw cards just to see what new critter or construction I can eyeball. And let me tell ya, there are A LOT of different critters and constructions. I applaud whoever did the artwork for this one as it‚Äôs very well done and ‚Äúcute‚Äù. Add in the tree to the board and the fact that each player plays a specific critter with corresponding meeples that resemble said critter. Ugh it‚Äôs amazing. Oh! Speaking of that the base game comes with 4 different player meeples which are: Squirrels, Hedgehogs, Turtles and Mice.The game catches the eye of anyone that happens into the room as well, primarily due to the giant tree sitting at the back of the board. I have gotten a few people saying, ‚ÄúOhhh what‚Äôs thisss, it looks cute!‚Äù and the visual lures people in closer and they will sit down for a few minutes watching the game. This is actually kinda rare with games that I have played and it really goes to show you how much presence this game has.Rulebook ‚ÄìThe rulebook is VERY good at explaining the game in an easy to understand and concise way. I went through it very quickly and only had to reference it one other time after that for clarification during gameplay. I think it‚Äôs because the game really doesn‚Äôt have a million things to do during your turn and that makes it pretty simple to grasp. As you progress through the seasons and get more cards played into your city the game does get much deeper on how you want to synergize your played cards to maximize your points. But by that time you have pretty much gotten the game play down pat.Table Talk/Fun Factor ‚ÄìEach player is working for themselves trying to build up their critter town but that doesn‚Äôt mean this game lacks table talk! On the contrary there are specific cards that actually allow players to play their meeples on other player‚Äôs cards to gain a benefit. I think this is a really cool mechanic as it promotes table talk and not only adds to the game for one player but the player that owns the card will also gain some benefit. You do end up discussing the cards a lot during play as there is a ‚Äúmeadow‚Äù on the board that has 8 cards laid out for everyone to see. This acts as sort of a shared hand of cards for everyone and allows anyone (on their turn) to play cards directly from the meadow if they can pay for them. Once you play a card a new card is drawn to replace it. I found most of the table talk and excitement came when drawing a new card. It really is super exciting to see what new critter or building will appear even if it‚Äôs not something you really need.Optimal Player Count ‚Äì2 or 3 players is perfect for this game. Because of the kind of scrunched seating a full 4 players is a little uncomfortable. However I can say that the game plays just as well with 4 players as it does 2. ALSO the game is fully functional as a solo game if you prefer to play 1 player games! It has a really creative story involved that you must defeat this rat who is just the worst. I haven‚Äôt delved too deep into this yet but I did peruse the directions and it seems like it is very unique and interesting.Final Thoughts ‚ÄìThis is one of the better worker placement games I have played. The artwork is gorgeous and the mechanics are sound. You can really tell they have put a lot of love into the components and gameplay. The rules are easy to learn and I really love how the game becomes deeper and deeper as you progress which makes the game that much easier to understand. There is a ton of variety on the cards which lends to mucho replay value. I would say if you enjoy worker placements then this is one you should not pass up!",5.0

The component quality is fantastic and the gameplay is solid.  Only negative I have is that you can finish at different times, so you might end up twiddling your thumbs for a little bit waiting for the other person(s) to finish.  Another possible negative is that you're at the mercy of your card draws, so there is some randomness and luck.  The meadow is 8 cards anyone can play on (in addition to your hand of up to 8), I like that this open market is pretty large.  I don't see this random factor as a negative, personally, but you might.  Overall a very fun game that looks fantastic on the table.",5.0
2088,B0792JY6G4,R2SDRYP1RCCT0K,A cornerstone for your gaming library,"  As the title says, this is a cornerstone for your gaming library. I have played a good amount of Euro-games and currently own Viticulture, World's Fair, Imperial Settlers and now Everdell. Everdell is a slightly more advanced version of Viticulture. There are slightly more options for your meeples and the cards you get, whether Locations or Critters, always have some kind of ability that will help you now or later in the game. The artwork is simply stunning, some of the best, truly top-notch. It really immerses you and makes you excited to read the small quote or details that come with the critter or location. The pace moves quickly and crazy enough my 8 year old and 11 year old not only wanted to play but were able to strategize and play along in a game I was extremely certain was far above their ability (The publisher recommends 14+). That not only didn't stop my youngest players but it even captivated them for the 3 hours it took to complete the 4 player game.I have only played this once, right out of the box and its an instant hit in our boardgaming families library. We talked about the game well after we finished and my wife and I are attempting to play again this evening in a 2 player game. If you are looking for something slightly more advanced than Viticulture, this is your game. If you have never played a Euro game, this is your game. If you love animals, this is your game. I don't know many people who wouldn't thoroughly enjoy this game. Well done, Startling Games. This is one of your first games I have ever played and if any of the other games that are soon to come out are anything as good as this, then we have ourselves a new head honcho publisher that has entered the market.

The art is beautiful and the smaller components are very nice quality.My only issue with the game is the design flaw of the tree. The tree is built in such a way that you can't really play with people all around the table. We have to bunch at one end to use it properly. It's optional, but it's still a beautiful component.It's basically Agricola with more luck involved. Luck is a pretty big component in my experience so far. Bad starting hand? Bad draw?

My wife is a rulebook fan, but we both needed to watch a round or two being played online to understand it. There's also some imprecise wording on some of the cards that are open to interpretation. Nothing a good copy edit and wording changes in a second edition wouldn't fix, but it can make the first game or two a little frustrating.- Full sized cards (preferably with sleeves), the big standing tree, and large play area mean you'll need a lot of table space for this.

Two players can play and the game is still fun. There's not a lot of player to player interaction, with the exception of the ""fool"" card which you can give to someone as a way to reduce 2 victory points. The game is definitely replay-able since the deck is random, the events are randomly drawn, and the forest areas change from game to game. This game is kid friendly. It's just about animals in the forest and resource gathering. Reminds me of elements from Dominion (deck building, kind of), Stone Age (worker placement, resource gathering), 7 Wonders (free critter or buildings if you have the predecessor). Also, beautiful artwork.",5.0
2096,B0792JY6G4,RBDCA3XAXZH8P,"Relaxing, fun & adorable","  We just got this game a couple days ago and it is a ton of fun. The artwork is tremendous on all of the cards and although the instructions may seem daunting at first, once you get into playing it...things pick up nicely and are easy to get the hang of in our opinion. For all of the competitive board games we own, this one is definitely the most relaxing and enjoyable. It's a nice change of pace and a really good resource management game for beginners.",5.0
2097,B0792JY6G4,R6MA2VNB4SKEJ,Not a bad little game,"  While everyone we have played this game with enjoys it and likes the mechanics of the game, there is one pattern we seem to be noticing.  Generally, when playing with 4 people, one player will do really well and one will suck rocks.  It seems to heavily favor the first player. We can't know this for sure since we have never officially tracked it, but that is the impression we are getting.Perhaps allowing everyone access to all the basic forest spaces (not just the open ended circles) would allow everyone a more fair chance.  I think I will try that next time I play and see if that makes a difference to the gameplay.",4.0
2098,B0792JY6G4,R1HBU53D3M67C8,Really great game!,"  Really a fun game for up to 4 people (you can add more with an expansion). The rules are easy to follow but I suggest finding a video on youtube to see how it is played for easier understanding. The game overall is very well crafted. I highly recommend getting the collector's edition of this game (as well as the expansions). You can buy add ons to make the base game turn into a ""collector's edition"" so you can get the base game and upgrade later. Good artwork, sturdy pieces. The only suggestion is to get 4 small bowls for the pieces so they aren't just sitting on the board. The fruit in particular likes to roll around.",5.0
2099,B0792JY6G4,R1GCDSAG1727H4,Excellent game for family,"  We enjoy this so much. I purchased it for my husband and he really likes it. The artwork is so beautiful and we enjoy looking at the cards and the board as much as we enjoy playing it. We are looking forward to having family and friends over for a game night and pulling this out for everyone to have fun with. It's not too overly complicated, and not so simple as to not be challenging.",5.0
2100,B0792JY6G4,RXHHBDSKJDLRJ,LOVE THIS GAME,"  It took a while to walk through the game and learn the strategy and rules, but it is totally worth it.  The strategy is a bit complex so it is a great game for adults.  It is difficult for kids but my 12-year-olds are learning.  Our friends love it too.  The art and aesthetic is phenomenal and calming!  I can't recommend this game enough.  Quickly became a family favorite.",5.0
2101,B0792JY6G4,R1KFS38LUO3G19,"Great game, but damaged on arrival","  This is an amazing game with quality pieces and is very fun to play.  Would easily be five stars, but unfortunately the game box was damaged when it arrived.  There was a half-dollar sized hole on the cover of the box, which is a shame because the artwork is terrific.  The package that amazon shipped the box in was not damaged, which leads me to believe that the game box was damaged before shipment.  This really is an amazing game, but as someone that really appreciates the aesthetics of the box art, I am disappointed with the damage.",3.0

2103,B0792JY6G4,R16GB539J6TORF,Stunning Game,"  The artwork is amazing. It takes some time to grasp all the components of the events and how to play but easy after a couple of tries. It's not a co-op game, but you don't feel like you have to plot against the other players to win. You simply build your city and characters and enjoy your strategy as you go. Beware the little berries are so cute almost look like candy :)",5.0

2105,B0792JY6G4,R1IH814ORL54UV,Beautiful and Fun,"  This game is probably the most beautiful game I‚Äôve ever seen. But the best part is, it is also super FUN! Worker placement with tons if options and clever mechanics‚Äîeven when it is not your turn you have lots to consider. This will take many more plays before it feels like we‚Äôve mastered it, but even when you know you aren‚Äôt quite nailing a strategy you are still having fun.",5.0
2106,B0792JY6G4,R11I59RNZUOKH8,Beautiful game and artwork,"  The game is of the worker placement genre of which we have quite a few. However, this one is very easy to learn and is not very long to play. Besides, the artwork is very nice. The only concern, raised by others as well, is the rather small font on the cards. Other than that a the game is a charm!",5.0
2107,B0792JY6G4,RO839FOWSW784,Great game. Great seller,  Super fun game. I play a lot of different board games with the wife and we both love this game.

Im not gonna lie, its a little complicated and takes a practice game or two to get it but its not too bad because it ends up being alot of fun. The  cards are small and require careful reading of small print. Kids dont seem to have a problem with that though. Bought this for Christmas and my teenagers love it.",5.0

2115,B01ISKSRK8,R1U3DPLF0NDE58,I might just make my own that resemble the classic game and will fit better. In short,"  Simplified version of the older one. The newer rules (you don't build the trap as you go) make for a faster, more accessible game for youngsters but the actual trap isn't as neat as the older one. It actually fails to go off more than half the time unless you fiddle around with the cage and washtub setup. I'm also not entirely sure why they made the mice so gigantic, they barely fit under the trap! I might just make my own that resemble the classic game and will fit better. In short, I like the newer rules for my young son but wish I'd found an older version of the game that worked better!",2.0
2116,B01ISKSRK8,R2AYOKHI7ES9V9,Pieces don‚Äôt line up,  Bought as a gift from Santa so I‚Äôm not able to return it without coming up with some sort of explanation. The bucket moves too much and doesn‚Äôt quite line up with the gutter so the ball will never be able to set off the trap. Now it‚Äôs just a regular board game with a bunch of extra parts for decoration.. very frustrated.,1.0
2117,B01ISKSRK8,R22WY3IBAOGRJB,"Still fun, but take your time assembling it","  It took me a minute - and a YouTube video - to figure out why the ball was not completing the circuit, but once I got the last piece carefully and completely slotted into the cardboard, it worked like a charm and has been perfect ever since! Don't give up or rush through assembly - and use YouTube, Hasbro has a video about assembling this that is very helpful!  It's flimsier plastic than the old-school versions I remember as a kid, but it will work beautifully if you get things completely locked in place. We've played and assembled/disassembled it countless times already and it still works perfectly every time.",5.0
2118,B01ISKSRK8,R2T7O1NMLC588O,Love it but not quite as good as original,  I have been looking for the mouse trap game like the one I had as a kid. For the longest time they changed it to aim at younger kids. Finally brought back the original board yea! However they kept the mice the larger little kid size. I know it's for choking  safety but they are to big. You can barely capture one in the trap let alone several. It takes away quite s but of the fun. I have small kids so I get safety but the dice included is still the size of the small mice. Makes no sense.,4.0
2119,B01ISKSRK8,R23PNN899LZ0RV,No hand crank.  Splurge for other version.,  Not the same as I was a kid.  I really miss the hand crank!!!!  I would spend a few extra and get the one you build as you go (great for building dexterity skills) and that has the hand crank.  Kicking the bucket was tricky and the boot keeps wanting to kick toward the outside and doesn't really have enough consistency.  Thinking of returning for the other version...  but I'm not sure how returns here work?,2.0
2120,B01ISKSRK8,R3J69A0JREPAF2,Not as good as the original.,"  This is not the original Mousetrap that you grew up with. We lost our old Mouse Trap game in a move so we bought this one. The board is different and the rules or different. The board is set up so that you really just assemble the whole trap and then begin playing. We fixed that by simply making our own rules that are similar to the old one. Oh, and no crank to turn anymore. Boo.",3.0
2121,B01ISKSRK8,R2TELY5K727QPG,Complete waste of money,"  Games have turned to cheap trash from the original and that‚Äôs just what this is. None of the parts line up and they gave us two of the wrong piece in the box for one part that is now not level. Nothing lines up at all for the mouse trap to work. Complete waste of money, go on eBay and get the original, we were ripped off completely and will be seeking a refund.",1.0
2122,B01ISKSRK8,RBPD8LNU1NRF4,Don‚Äôt waste your money,  Half of the pieces don‚Äôt fit into the holes and the other half doesn‚Äôt line up with the other pieces. 100% of the time I cannot get the marble to go into the ‚Äútub‚Äù from the swing arm. The cheese doesn‚Äôt come with anything to store it in so I‚Äôm always finding it all over the floor and it‚Äôs definitey one of those things that once you take it out of the box you can barely fit it back inside when you‚Äôre done.,1.0
2123,B01ISKSRK8,R1R5GJ2CCYNFCL,Needs A New Price Point,"  While my son (he is three) loves this game, I am not 100% happy with it.1st the instructions are terrible. If you buy this I recommend putting in the third section before the 2nd section. Following the instructions for this part will lead to explicit cursing and language.2nd the basket section does not ""sit"" in the holes so it rocks back and forth on top of game board. This means everytime my toddler moves his game piece on the board the trap triggers and falls down.3rd It is pretty cheaply made for the price. We paid $18. It was $25 in the store so we felt like we were getting a deal. It seems to be authentic to Hasbro, so we were highly disappointed in the quality for the price.Again, the toddler loves it! Mom & dad, not so much.",4.0
2124,B01ISKSRK8,R28912SEPACEK2,Great updated game,"  This was a replacement for an older version of the game sure to pieces in the old game breaking with use over time. There are some nice upgrades here.< Less pieces to put together, better flow, more ease of resetting for the next turn.< A catapult, how fun! Though maybe a little tedious to resetü§î, but the old hand was too.< No crank  to constantly fall apart< Only requires one metal ""ball"", not two< Only 1 die, vs 2 dice before< Less pieces of cheese than our older game< Slightly different game play/rules< Bigger mice/playing pieces/cheese slicesOverall I like this version better. My 4 year old grandson loves this game, both versions, though he is only interested in the mechanics of it, watching it all run, not playing the actual game.So,  one piece of advice.  If the catapult  throws the ball off to the side, instead of into the gutter to the tub, make sure all the pieces are actually fit into all the slots of the gameboard as intended. If  even one little corner is not, it'll probably throw the ball off.",5.0
2125,B01ISKSRK8,R2BAQJXJG0J3HJ,Disappointing quality,  I had my old version of Mouse Trap that my kids loved playing. When they broke a few pieces I was looking to replace it. We bought another version that was very simplistic and the kids didn't enjoy it so decided to try this version out. While it was more along the lines to the old version we had the pieces were not cut quite right so the pieces didn't fit quite right and would shift so the trap didn't spring properly. The kids tried to play it a few times and finally got frustrated and gave up. I'm not sure if it was just the particular set we received or if all of them were like this. Quality definitely didn't seem the greatest.,2.0
2126,B01ISKSRK8,R2HT7L1F0SPP5D,Poor packaging,"  I loved this game as a child and my 4 year old loves it too. However, this particular product had multiple issues.1. The box it comes in opens on the side (not a bottom and lid) which makes putting the game away in the original box nearly impossible.2. The plastic used for this particular item is not very sturdy and doesn‚Äôt always stay in place on the board, requiring manipulation by a person to make the actual ‚Äútrap‚Äù aspect of the game appear to function.3. Again, with the storage problem, there are so many pieces and no organized way to store all of them. They game secured in the box with tape and other single use material all for the outward presentation of the game box. Not something that can be replicated.It wasn‚Äôt a bad price and is a game kids love, but minor changes to the packaging would make huge improvements.",5.0
2127,B01ISKSRK8,RS892KBLJ7HD4,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"  I have such fond memories of playing mousetrap as a child, so I bought for my grandkids to play on our vacation is case of rainy day.  We got a rainy day but this mousetrap is non functioning.  Sometimes it works - the ball lands in the bucket, which causes the other things to happen - but it's rare.  My grandson became so frustrated he kicked it.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY - THIS GAME IS CHEAP CRAP.",1.0

The bucket/bathtub/diver are the problem, like the other games I got them at steep discount on Amazon buy for that discount I‚Äôd be returning. Instead it‚Äôll just be trashed.

2130,B01ISKSRK8,R13FLLGBQQF85Z,Memories,"  It's fun to relive this childhood classic game. The second part of the ball rolling from the gutter to the bucket that is supposed to flip up rarely works right, which is a little disappointing. But hey, it sure does bring back memories.

In a full game play, triggering the contraption probably 15 or 20 times, I think it actually successfully completed without assistance maybe twice. Oh well.

2134,B01ISKSRK8,R3IST2OASH2WIA,build a better mousetrap,  Now I know where the saying about building a better mousetrap comes from. We spend more time chasing the silver ball around since the broom doesn't line up to gutter and it falls out of tub.  Could be a blast for 5 year old who doesn't mind crawling under furniture to chase the marble or that the trap won't stay up.  It is time to build a better mousetrap.,2.0

Nothing that encourages the kids to figure something out.- the set up is complicated, doesn‚Äôt work many times, and will be hard to store. Very quickly we will lose a piece that will make this game useless.- the mouse trap is really gentle, so that it falls all the time even when you don‚Äôt mean it to, for a very excited six year old, this brings a lot of frustration, which is exactly what I want to avoid when playing games with kids.",1.0

2139,B01ISKSRK8,R299EWMJSF9DRM,Not what it used to be,"  I received the game as described, the only thing wrong was that it is a completely different, dumbed down version of what the game used to be! Instead of players building the mousetrap as you go, you have to build it beforehand. Then instead of winning by being the last mouse not trapped, whoever has the most cheese wins. It's like it's a PC version where no one really loses. I'll be giving this one away promptly and fixing my old, broken game! The new version is totally boring.",1.0

We had so much fun (he played Godzilla, I was King Ghidora) that dad and little brother wanted to join us as well! We then played the game THREE nights in a row, the whole family, and with the kids willingly giving up screen time to go head to head to destroy Tokyo. LOLThe game movers are fully sculpted plus all the 3D buildings to destroy - it really makes it like a little diorama of the city to rampage through. The artwork is so fun and immersive - and it's all based on the classic films but not just screen grabs.Highly recommend! I'll be giving this one as a gift for Christmas for sure.",5.0
2146,B085WL16T6,R1FOF3ECCETI5Y,"A Board Game for Anyone, and Especially Godzilla Fans","  Recently there‚Äôs been an influx of Godzilla merchandise which for Godzilla fans is very exciting. This board game is an example of something that feels like it was made by fans of Godzilla that wanted to create a fun game with one of the best kaiju.The build quality on this game is great, the cardboard pieces aren‚Äôt flimsy in the slightest and are actually fairly thick which leads me to believe they‚Äôll last a long time. Same goes for the plastic building pieces as well. The Kaiju are also well made and fell like they‚Äôll withstand the way I play the game which is to smash the monsters at the things they‚Äôre destroying (it‚Äôs more fun that way).The actual gameplay is really fun, gaining energy to use attacks to fight other players. Each kaiju also has abilities that don‚Äôt cost energy which means that even players who don‚Äôt have any energy can participate in the action. It‚Äôs actually a pretty simple system to understand and within one game my sister understood the rules as well as I did without even reading the manual. As a convenient addition the back cover of the manual has the steps of every turn so you can very easily look to it if you forget what‚Äôs next.The only reason I removed a star is a minor annoyance that kept me from having a perfect time with this game. My game came with an extra energy tracking cube bag instead of the stand for Mothra. Luckily Mothra can be placed in such a way that she doesn‚Äôt fall, but it‚Äôs fairly sensitive, and when the Mothra piece is always on the move some time has to be dedicated to make sure she doesn‚Äôt fall over and push over other pieces. It‚Äôs a small inconvenience, but just be sure when you get your game that you have all the necessary parts, you never know if it‚Äôll miss something important.Overall this game is amazing, and a fun game not just for fans of Godzilla, but I‚Äôd say even for people who just like board games. I wouldn‚Äôt mind if down the line they make expansion packs. Add even more monsters, like Anguilas, Rodan, or even something out of left field like Eborah. This game is crazy fun with details that will make a Godzilla fan‚Äôs heart soar.",4.0

I noticed it was made by Funko, whose Pop figurines I kind of hate. However, they delivered on a well made and faithful product.It's a strategy game where you win by having the highest total of points, not by ""killing"" your opponent. It's easy to set up and has that sweet spot of 45 min to an hour for play time. The only thing I don't care for so far is some of the rules don't make logical sense. For example: your kaiju can't directly attack buildings. Other than that I've enjoyed this quite a lot, and I really hope they do some expansions.",5.0

There have been a number of games based on giant monsters duking it out, but none have scratched the itch as well as this game.  Love the original art on the cards, the variable play styles of each monster, as you play the cards based on energy you gain by smashing up buildings and so forth.  It flows very well once you get the rules down...speaking of which, the rules are not the clearest in the world, and I had to find some answers to questions I had on some gaming websites.  Also, there are only 4 monsters, and after playing it 6 times I am already wanting more - hoping an expansion comes out in the future.

We have a veritable STACK of games including ones ranging in complexity and game dynamics from classic Uwe Rosenberg games to games like Munchkin and hefty hardcore games like Terra Mystica and Feast For Odin. What were we desiring? Something that's like that ever elusive ""perfect bowl of porridge"" from Goldilocks. A game that wouldn't draw out for 8+ hours but still seemingly offered infinite possibilities for multi- layered conceptually exciting play.  Well, friends,  this is THAT, and more. It also presents with panoramic and beautiful graphics on the cards.  Elements will change every game, making it certain you will never play the same game twice. The trail pieces get placed in different order. Sometimes it will be more to your benefit to collect one type of resource versus another. There are modifiers that your opposing trail-mates can only guess at. There is a satisfying push-pull between your decision constraints and the satisfactions of your results,  unlike an Uwe Rosenberg game where every little thing you do does feel frustratingly ""little"". The game lasts about an hour or so and is the perfect casual tabletop game, where things feel real as you're playing but not Feast For Odin level of intense, where unpacking the box itself is a chore. If you're trying to get your friends more into tabletop gaming as well, this is a great ""gateway"" game.  Highly recommend.",5.0

Stunning artwork on every card makes it a beautiful and exciting game to play. Biggest downside is probably the fact that not every national park is represented (15 or 16 aren‚Äôt included), which is a bit of a disappointment, considering some parks get multiple cards. Even prominent parks such as Glacier and Death Valley do not get a card in this game. There were also some typos/informational errors (Great Basin NP is said to be in Colorado, whereas it is in Nevada).

First off, the artwork and design of this game is beautiful.  The artwork is from a series on national parks and it's stunning. The designers also went the extra mile to include game trays to neatly store all game components in the box.As for gameplay itself, Parks is a turn based resources gathering and upgrading game with the theme being hiking to different sites.  Various mechanics such as season, gear, campfires and weather patterns can be used to your advantage and make for a new experience every game.  Those familiar with other euro style games will pick up quickly.  New players will have no problem picking up the game as turns and actions are fairly straightforward.  The game is fun to play with a group and is more relaxed than a game like Risk, which I feel lead it to being a fun social experience.

2217,B0757QD8FY,RG9JJAIGN0397,"Life, Parcheesi, and a journey along Tokai-do","  A review for Tokaido requires a discussion on the theme and art, and a discussion on the mechanics.Let's start with the mechanics.  Tokaido is an odd combination of the Game of Life and Parcheesi, with a unique movement twist thrown in.  Tokaido is based on Tokai-do, an old road that runs between Kyoto and Tokyo.  The board is a representation of that road, with stops for beautiful views, hot springs, inns, and the like.  Every turn, the last player on the road will move as little or as far as they would like - no dice rolling, no spinning, you decide the distance.  However, you cannot stop at a location occupied by another player (the Parcheesi element), and all players must stop at the various inns for everyone to catch up.  When you make stop, you will engage in an encounter and various things will happen - too varied for this review - all of which are based around points or money (the Game of Life element).  You can also potentially gain benefits based on the ability of your traveler (there are 10, increasing the replayability substantially).It is simple premise, so I found myself surprised at the light tactical nature of the game.  Where and when you move matters quite a bit, as does when you move into an inn.  Your timing can both hurt your opponents and yourself if you're not careful.  On top of that, you need to decide whether to play to your abilities or worry more about hamper your opponent's.  While Tokaido won't win any awards for it's strategy, it will keep your brain engaged enough during your play.The theme and the art are what really steal the show and bring the game to the table.  As noted, the game is about a journey, a peaceful walk in a slower time.  Everything is (digitally) painted in bright watercolors, with quite a bit of variation within each type of encounter.  For example, when you draw a meal card at the inn, there are 10 or 12 different food types.  It is a pleasant experience to play this game on a cold rainy day; with a bit of imagination, you really feel as though you are travelling along the coast of southern Japan.To me, it is that ability to inspire the imagination that puts Tokaido into the 5-star territory.  Once the mechanics are explained, our house rule will be that you don't receive your points unless you role-play the encounter.  There is enough variety among the encounter types - and of course the imagination is limitless - to turn the game into a great story-telling game!  On top of being great for kids, it helps make the game remain meaningful even when you are in last place.  Even if you don't play that way, you will find yourself writing a story in your head.I would strongly suggest this game for any family and as a light breather for game groups.  It is a simple game, but one that can still make you smile if you let it.",5.0
2218,B0757QD8FY,R1BK00Y53E2B2P,A new game night staple,"  Tokaido is one of the loveliest games I‚Äôve ever come across. It seemed complicated at first, but it‚Äôs really quite simple. There‚Äôs nothing stressful about it and everyone feels accomplished at the end, and yet the strategy keeps you engaged from start to finish. Couldn‚Äôt recommend it enough!",5.0
2219,B0757QD8FY,R275UAF0JLRX09,Delivers a relaxing feeling,"  Tokaido is a relatively simple game that gives you a very relaxing feeling while playing. We'll often play it after a heavier game just to relax a bit. The rules are very straighforward. Each player is a character with a special ability that will help you when you stop at specific spaces as you traverse the path. Decisions are fairly easy: stop at a location, pick up the corresponding card and gain immediate points, choose to purchase it or leave an offering at the temple. Almost every action will give you some points so it minimized analysis paralysis.Turn order is determined by the person last on the path. If you move too far ahead to claim a space, you're allowing your opponents more time to move and gain points. There are several locations where everyone will catchup before you proceed on the path so no one can really get too far ahead.The artwork is beautiful and adds to the zen-like experience of playing. Actions you take against another player appear very subtle since all you can really do is block them from taking a certain space but then they may take a space you really want.This is a good game to introduce non-gamers to or to people that just want a relatively simple game to learn and play.",5.0

Yes, it does take some strategy (unless you choose to la-de-la your way down the road and just enjoy your trip or something). The artwork is soothing and there are no negative points (bad events) so it is an uplifting game, even when playing with a conniver.",5.0

While not for small and young kids due to its different concept of movement, it can be a great game for everyone else.",5.0
2222,B0757QD8FY,R1S4N1UW5I8GKJ,A perfect expansion. Base Tokaido is very very light,"  A perfect expansion.Base Tokaido is very very light, almost to the point that it's only fun with children or very new gamers. This expansion adds a decision to every space on the board except the inns, and, surprisingly, that seems to be enough to really add a fair amount of strategy- when you land on any space, you have your choice of drawing a random Tokaido card (or 3 and choosing depending on the space), OR you can pick up the ENTIRE crossroads deck of 6 cards for that space and pick ONE card from it (often for a price).The Temple now gives you the option to purchase an amulet for 1 coin (again, not at random- you pick one of 6 from the deck). Each amulet acts as sort of an ""instant"" card from Magic: The Gathering, being able to be played at any time that they would have an effect. For example, one of the cards let's you occupy the same space as someone else even if it's occupied (when both of you are last place on the board, you move first). Another let's you get a single meal card for free. You pick up the whole deck and choose this card in secret (the deck is kept face down for this reason).The Village now has the option of letting you acquire one of six legendary objects- 2 of them, for 1 coin each, give you a point for every souvenir and legendary object in your collection; 2 of them, for 2 coins each, add a 5th suit to your souvenirs worth up to 9 points; the last 2 are legendary katanas worth 3 coins each that score 8 victory points. The village is arguably the most contested space on the board with the expansion so long as players have money, and making the decision early on to purchase a 5th suit or a card that scores a point for every souvenir/legendary object is an extremely risky one, especially with lots of players competing for villages, while buying a katana has less potential points, but might be enough in the late game to get you just far ahead enough.The Hot Springs now let you choose to instead buy a bathhouse card for 1 coin instead of drawing from the 'monkey"" deck. Bathhouses are ALL 4 points each.The Encounter (traveler) space let's you draw a calligraphy card instead of meeting someone. These, like the amulets, are chosen in secret, and give you a secret goal to complete for extra points- one, for example, gives you extra points for accomplishments and other calligraphy cards (including itself), while another gives you extra points for arriving at the last inn last.The three painting spaces give you the option of drawing one of six cherry trees, all of which are worth 2 points and give you a coin. This simple addition is actually my favorite of all the new decks, as it allows anyone who gets blocked from the bank another way to acquire money, AND it doesn't force someone from having to skip a painting space simply because they already finished that space's panorama (if the deck is empty, they will then have to skip the space). The downside of not getting the huge potential points of completing panoramas could be worth the coin, especially if other people are competing for panoramas and you simply wish to block them.Finally, the bank gives you the option to gamble 2 coins (if you have them) and roll a die for a payout. The die has faces X, 1x, 2x, 3x, 3x, and 4x, meaning there's a 50% chance of getting more than 3 coins net (that is, more than 5 coins), while it gives a 50% chance of a net less than 3 coins. This option is often the least picked, BUT it's potential payout for, say, a low wealth character that early on decides to wager to get even with everyone else, or for someone towards the end who just needs a lot of money for whatever reason, makes it a valuable one to have in the game. Strategically, it's a worse option most of the time, but the fact that it's there and can absolutely put someone into the lead makes me happy that it exists.The expansion also comes with 6 new characters (adding to a total of 16), 4 of which can actually be played in base Tokaido. One of them is completely under-powered (he starts with 0 coins and gets a coin for each painting space he lands on, with a potential payout of up to 9 coins, which ties with one other character in coins without having a relevant ability). However, the other 5 are perfectly fine for the most part.It should be noted that the rules are a tad confusing- online FAQ's helped me figure out exactly what IS and ISN'T counted between the two games, and the interaction of symbols between the two games basically comes down to this:- If a character's ability is activated on a space, then it activates even if the Crossroads option is picked (like the man who gets a free donation to the temple every time he lands there still gets a donation even if he picks to buy an amulet).- If a card or ability scores bonus points for a type of Tokaido card, it DOES extend to the Crossroads cards (like the man who gets a bonus point for every hot springs- he also gets points for bathhouses).- If a character's ability let's them draw a card for free or for a discount, it ONLY refers to the Tokaido card pictured (like the woman who gets the cheaper of two souvenirs for free, or the man who draws a souvenir every inn).This discrepancy was a bit confusing at first, but it becomes natural enough after a few plays. The rule book, after reading it three or four times, didn't do a very good job explaining this, but comments from Antoine Bauza himself allowed people to figure out these basic rules. Other than that, the game is solid, and Tokaido + Crossroads is really the only right way to play Tokaido. If you like Euro games and perfect theme, GET THEM BOTH.",5.0

Not to mention the art and design of the game is gorgeous!The rules are a little challenging to understand when you read them, but after playing once, we were able to get the hang of them (you learn more by doing than reading). Especially the different characters you can play which each have their own unique abilities.

2224,B0757QD8FY,R2B19GTBBDJJQI,An Elegant Addition to Tokaido,"  I am a huge fan of Tokaido. It's a lighthearted family game with tons of theme and atmosphere; the game is as much an experience as a competition. It helps that I'm a Japanophile. The Matsuri expansion adds to the fun of the game with its Matsuri Cards, which present interesting and fun Japanese holidays. They add variety to the journey--and therefor boost game replayability--without adding complexity. The new Matsuri travelers are also fun, and don't require the Matsuri cards to play; you can play them with the base Tokaido game, or with Tokaido+Crossroads.As I said, the Matsuri cards do not significantly complicate the game. Since I really enjoy the flavor they add, but the rules only call for drawing 6 Matsuri cards and playing 3 during the journey, I use a Let's Party! house rule; draw 3 Matsuri cards and play 2 at each intermediate inn.",5.0

He thought it'd be really dumb. There's actually strategy in how to play to win. Counter to Western games which are formulaic in how-to-win (I enjoy these), Japanese board games are not as straightforward. The strategy to win changes each time - it depends on how your opponents are playing.When you play 2-player, there is a 3rd, neutral token controlled by the players in a specific fashion. This neutral token adds another layer of strategy to the game. Children can easily play and gain points, having fun, while adults can strategize for maximum score. A truly thoughtful game that can be played in either a relaxed manner or with an intensely competitive style.Buy this now. There is so much replay value.",5.0

They decide how far to move nad what to do when they land on a space.  Those choices can win them the game or lose it.

I definitely recommend this expansion to help increase the depth of play, as well as replay value. If you enjoy Tokaido, you should certainly pick up Crossroads!One minor (and surprising) disappointment: the ""punch-out"" holes on the new character tiles are visibly smaller than the ones in the core set's character tiles, and the colored disks from the core game that are designed to be inserted into said holes (to allow quick ID of ""who is who"") don't fit into them! (As in, not ""hard to fit"", but DO NOT fit).And odd manufacturing mishap that---while certainly not affecting game-play to any degree---is especially disappointing given the overall quality and aesthetic beauty of the game, and it's components. Hard to fathom how this could happen, but I really hope they correct this in future versions.",4.0

2247,B075B1WNDG,R3NRVJ5RIYV8D6,Love this game. Lengthy but enjoyable,"  Played 3 games so far, two solo and one with 2 players. I can say the games last a LONG time. Minimum 2 hours from what i've played and will more than likely last longer but that's not technically a bad thing as long as you're having a good time.Pretty easy to learn and I love how the instruction manuals are set up. 1 to learn the basics and then another for all the rule references. Lots of pictures and examples to help explain as well. The minis are very detailed and look great. There are 5 character classes to choose from and each has a different starting card which makes them all play really differently.There is a TON of variety for multiple playthroughs. Firstly there are 4 scenario cards, so 4 different all encompassing scenarios (worlds) to choose from that set up different from one another. Beyond that you have a number of hidden tiles that you mix up and place down without seeing, so each game regardless of scenario will be varied as far as which tiles you discover where. On top of that when you draw quest or encounter cards, depending on what decision you make out of the usual 3 choices on each card will determine what other quests cards you place. And there are over 150 different quest and encounter cards to choose from. Lots of branches in this tree.The leveling up aspect is very well done and fun and there is a shop to use caps to buy upgrades and status effects like getting addicted to chems or vilified plus more. These little effects will have an effect on quests as well.For the most part I really love this game however there are a few factors about it that I don't much care for. The game starts out VERY exciting as the majority of each map (scenario) is hidden so you have to explore to start uncovering tiles and locations. However once you eventually get all the tiles explored and flipped, the mystery dies a little and with it, the fun....but just a little. By this point of the game (probably an hour or more in) you will hopefully already be super deep into a quest line and have some idea on what you need to do to get those last few remaining influence points to win.Which brings me to the next downside, the win condition. To win you need to acquire a certain number of influence points throughout the game based on how many players there are. For a 2 player game it's 10. You can acquire influence mostly by completing quests but there are a few other ways to get it. Each influence card you have is worth 1 influence point but the catch is, you can only have a total of 4 influence cards in your inventory. So then it comes down to utilizing the text on the influence cards to try and maximize the amount of influence you get per card based on whatever it reads on a particular card.Most commonly this would boil down to supporting one of the two other factions that are included in the particular scenario you picked. Here's the catch, when you support the AI faction, USUALLY they will gain influence as well and if they gain enough, they can win and you lose. SO it's an interesting balance game that you need to play in order to make sure they stay on top BUT not too far on top. Basically just enough to help you win.So for me the second half of the game isn't as much fun as the first half when you are exploring. That's not to say that the second half is bad, it's just different. Which brings me to my next point, the enemies and fighting. As you travel around discovering tiles you will also unlock enemies of all kinds which you can fight to gain experience and loot, which is always a welcome thing. The thing is, the enemies never REALLY die. Once you kill one you replace the enemy tile with another facedown inactive enemy tile. So it lingers inactive till the enemy phase which activates it, which could be a few turns depending on if that enemy type is chosen.This isn't a terrible thing....until the later half of the game when you have all tiles exposed and around 15 enemies chasing you all over the board. At that point you can never linger too long in one spot as they can and will gang up on you. I can see why this mechanic is the way it is though, if you get to that point of the game and you still haven't won, more than likely one of the two factions is about win. It's like the game wants to end and ramps up the difficulty the longer you play. Of course this for me was about 3 or so hours in.My favorite thing about the game by FAR is the sheer amount of story and quest cards with so many different decisions. The flavor text on each card is amazing and when one gets drawn, the person to your right reads it and your options.....but not the consequences..........freaking awesome. So you have to go with your gut and pick what you think you would actually do......and hope it turns out to be the right choice.2/19/18 Update -- Have played many many more games with varying group sizes and this game is still very fun. The only downside I can point out would be the win condition which needs a bit of tweaking. Also posted another photo of the minis the game comes with. Note that I have painted them myself and they do not come painted.",5.0
2248,B075B1WNDG,R26YILZHN4XB9V,My First Board Game,"  Having never played a board game besides monopoly, but being a massive fallout fan, I decided to give this game a try. Took a little while to learn the rules but once I did it was an absolute blast. Provided you have a little imagination it plays just like the video game. I‚Äôve played all 4 scenerios and loved each one, I‚Äôm planning on looking what else is available for board games because apparently I‚Äôve been missing out.If you love fallout or want to try a board game that isn‚Äôt monopoly, I‚Äôd highly recommend this game.",5.0
2249,B075B1WNDG,R1TRBWQD6CMGG7,Awesome Game Play Overshadows the Horribe and Wonky Scoring System,"  It's hard for a publisher to bring a video game to life in the form of a board game, but Fantasy Flight has pulled off something wonderful with Fallout.  You still have the questing and random encounters as with the video game, albeit abstracted into encounters that you read out to one another in a choose your own adventure-like fashion.  I love how the combat system was abstracted with the dice hitting certain parts of a body, though the monsters you fight tend to be very easy or incredibly hard to hit and it can be frustrating knowing this is left up to the luck of a roll.  I've played this 4 times now with 2 and 4 players and we've all loved the experience.  It has a nice sandbox feel and everyone can kind of do their own thing without getting in each other's way too much, other than completing a quest someone else was going for.However, there is one major drawback to this game, and that's the scoring system.  It's tied to a faction system which is thematic with the video game, yet takes away from the board game.  The quests don't really make you feel like you're a part of a faction, so you have no real incentive to complete the faction quests unless you have an agenda that would push one over the edge to make you win.  Yet, you might end up with agendas that reward you for different factions, at which point the outcome is arbitrary.  Ending the game tends to be a random event and no one that has won so far felt it was due to any sort of strategy or skill, but all dumb luck in having the right agenda cards that happen to fit what everyone else was doing with the faction quests.  This is incredibly disappointing since it's the main way to end and win the game, but falls flat for everyone that plays.On the other hand, the sandbox experience, side quests, encounters, and enemy killing make up for a wonky scoring system and Fallout is still worth your time.  We love this game!",4.0
2250,B075B1WNDG,R29PUFLH8KLLB2,Very fun game. They did an amazing job capturing the ...,  Very fun game. They did an amazing job capturing the feel of the computer games in this board game. Most of the iconic stuff from the Fallout setting is here. I'm very happy with this purchase.The quest system built around a deck of cards that functions like a choose your own adventure book is great. I role played differently in each of the two sessions I played and felt like I was adequately rewarded both times. Role playing is not necessary in this game but I enjoyed it and certainly wasn't punished for it.I'm definitely looking forward to trying the game out solo a couple of times.My only complaint is that the rules booklets could use some editing and expanding. Rules questions definitely will come up and the answers can be hard to find sometimes. It wasn't until the end of my second game that I finally felt like I had a good understanding of most things. To be fair though the game was fun even while learning.I would rate this game 4.5 stars. Amazon doesn't allow half stars so I just gave it 4 here.,4.0
2251,B075B1WNDG,RE93HCALU9BEP,Not a bad game.,"  The game components are fantastic. The miniatures are very well done and detailed. The terrain tiles are very thematic and what you‚Äôd expect to see in the wasteland.The storytelling by quest deck is really interesting as well. It has many branching quests a al the video game.However, where this game shines in storytelling it lacks in overall gameplay.  I find this one to be a lot more fun solo than multiplayer.  The multiplayer is a competitive style and I think that‚Äôs why it falls short.  It should‚Äôve been more cooperative in nature.  And when you trigger end game, it just ends. So, if you‚Äôre following a quest line and are engaged in that particular story, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Game over.Overall, as a fallout fan, this game is enjoyable. But I recommend it more for solo play.  Hopefully in the future they will adjust the end game win condition or just release an entire coop variant.",3.0
2252,B075B1WNDG,R15SLS6EQM1RPJ,If you love the video game - you'll love the board game version!,"  From the first time I saw Fallout the board game on the shelf I knew I wanted it. I have been a fan of the Fallout line since the first game.  I have play almost every Fallout video game to come out and it was time to get the board game. After watching a couple videos on how to play, I was very intimidated. There seemed to be a lot of moving parts, card decks and miniatures. My fianc√© and I play a most of our games together and I was thinking this would be one that would be a little out of her comfort zone.I played through the single player game mode and enjoyed the game from the start. After the first game I knew the game was not as complicated as I thought. The game was so fun I stayed up till 3 am playing the game another 2 times. The next day I set it up for my fianc√© and I, and I wasn‚Äôt disappointed. My favorite part of the game is the questing. The flavor and the ways you go about completing the quest feel like playing a video game. This is the closet I have come, in a board game, to a video game RPG. With hundreds of quest cards, the game replay is awesome. We both enjoyed the game and can‚Äôt wait to introduce it to our play group.I play a lot of tabletop games with miniature and the piece in Fallout are top quality. Before long they will be painted and looking great on the great design of the game tiles. It really feels like you are in the wastelands. For those of you that have played the games, look forward to the quest for the Wasteland Survival Guide! All of the cards are well designed and I really like the decks are different physical sizes.  There wasn‚Äôt enough room in the box for the insert and all the cards/game pieces. And there was not enough bags for all the game pieces, packaging could have been thought out a little more. Other than that, the game is great and I am looking forward to the expansion.",5.0
2253,B075B1WNDG,RGLCLJMOGDBVT,"Enjoyable game, pathetic customer service","  If you are a fan of the Fallout Video games (more modern ones) then this game is for you.  FFG has done a good job of implementing Fallout in a board game.  The wasteland itself changes from game to game so you always get the enjoyment of exploring the unknown.  The equipment, enemies, allies and many others things have found their way into this game.  The game is relatively easy to learn and fun to play.  However, this game is actually more enjoyable as a solo experience than when played with others, in that the end-game is kinda broken when in competition with other players.Ordinarily I would give this game 4 or 5 stars.  I have chosen to only give three because recently FFG has changed their spare parts policy and will no longer provide spare parts.  If you lose a part, you cannot get another one without buying the whole game over again.  If the game is missing parts you cannot get replacements, your only remedy is to return the whole game for another copy.  Ordinarily I would recommend this game, especially for solo players, but with FFG deciding to no longer support their customers I can no longer support them and recommend not to buy this game.",3.0

And there is a lot of game management to do once you're underway.  There's a lot of depth, maybe too much, it might be better to be simpler..Gotta update this thing, I'm dropping my rating.  It is simply too complex to enjoy.  I spend all my time managing the game.  Combat is brutal and unforgiving, we had 8 battles straight where no one was able to kill anything and took huge damage.  With 4 people the game was dreadfully slow.  After 6 hours we'd only made it thru 2 and a half passes thru the action deck.

2255,B075B1WNDG,R2Q312MHP4ON8E,"Fun game for 1 to 4 players, complicated mechanics.","  Fun game to play if you like the Fallout universe. The solo mode means you can do a few runthroughs by yourself to learn the rules before having people over to try it.The game mechanics make it a pretty challenging experience, which makes it all the more fun as you're playing against the game and not against other players. So far in about 10 plays I was beaten by the game about half the time. The storyline/gamebook type quests mean replayability is high as the same campaign never plays the same and heavily relies on choices by the players and monster activation between turns.The design is pretty nice with the different figurines, enemies and objects.Be warned, it's a complicated games with a lot of different mechanics, a ton of different upgrades and evolving storylines. You'll need at least one complete playthrough with the rulebook close by to get comfortable with the way the game runs.That game also entails a lot of cleaning up after every game because of its mutiple cards, tokens, figurines and map tiles.Just too bad the game limits itself to campaigns from Fallout 3 and 4, would like a bit of love for Fallout 1 and 2.Overall pretty happy with my purchase, as a fan of the Fallout series it's been fun to play.",4.0
2256,B075B1WNDG,R22DTH0178ZOQY,Solid four-star board game,"  Fun game. It does really well making you feel like you're really exploring the maps and the different quest lines. The figurines are cool, and the mechanics that govern fighting monsters are well done.The one problem with the game is the win condition. You have hidden agenda cards through which you need to gain 10 points of ""influence"" to win the game. The cards are difficult to get, the agendas are difficult to fulfill, and none of them give you very much influence. And more cards you have, the faster the game ends so as soon as you feel like you're getting a handle on things, the game ends. To date, neither my husband nor I have gotten 10 influence.That one mechanic lets the game down, but overall the game is still worth it. You just need let it go that you probably won't win and just enjoy playing through the different quests. I think it's like a 7/10 on Board Game Geek and that feels right to me.",4.0

I recommend looking up ""Geek and Sundry"" on youtube and watching their rules explanation as it simplifies the whole thing.My wife and I picked up this game as I am a HUGE Fallout fan and wanted to check out the board game.

This is not a game you can buy, read the directions once and start playing and having fun.  The game play, for a complete beginner, was more like work than fun.

2260,B075B1WNDG,R10VK443S9FTAR,"Not the best Fantasy Flight Title, Still Fun","  Honestly, this game was so-so for me. The components are definitely the best part of the game and allow for a very immersive Fallout Feel. Fans of the series will absolutely love the components as well. The miniatures are well designed and high quality, and the hex tiles are highly quality than Catan and several other games that I have played.The instruction manual is clear though we still ran into problems that YouTube and Board Game Geek Forums were then able to solve. It was difficult to learn how to play the game still. I typically learn games fairly quickly, however this still took me two YouTube Walkthroughs and it was still slow getting started. By comparison, I learned Mansions of Madness in a single video and we had almost no hiccups.  Maybe that's just me though, and maybe this particular rule set was just hard for me to get my mind around.Combat is the worst aspect of this game by far. It is heavily luck based. In our game with 3 players, one player had trouble killing even the weakest of enemies, another had an okay time with most enemies, and one player never lost a combat encounter. However, it is still a heavily thematic combat which is still pretty cool.One complaint I have is that I was missing a single tile when I bought the game. I could have returned it, but honestly I just didn't want to wait the extra time. So instead I just did the research and found which tile was missing, and then printed it out. Not the best solution but hey, I guess I can be impatient.Overall, I would recommend this to hardcore Fallout fans who want a board game that brings you into the Fallout Universe.

We probably should have started with one of those instructional youtube videos instead.  The game is really fun and took the whole afternoon to play.  The one negative is a lack of clarity in a few situations such as when you run out of a type of monster tokens to draw from but quest cards tell you to place more on the board.

This will make an amazing gift for anyone you know that loves boards games or any of the fallout games. The game pieces are very sturdy and well made.

It's all about them re-rolls.Map tiles are cool, and quest narratives are pretty interesting.I'm a firm believer of ""making your own fun"", so you can always customize rules and such...but it shouldn't take this much effort to enjoy.",3.0

The game captures the feel of the video games, bringing in both multiple recognizable playable characters (Wastelander, Super Mutant, etc.) and baddies alike, and of course includes the never-ending array of both main and side quests.This is a game that is difficult to learn at first (and time-consuming to set up), but very enjoyable once you know how to play.

2277,B000P69H62,R120GWM62Z9W70,Ushering in the 2019 New Year with Redneck Life,"  Allow me to regale you with the colorful tale of how we ushered in the 2019 New Year with Redneck Life, and how consequently, the first words spoken in the New Year were not ""Happy New Year"".As is customary, my wife and I invite my aunt and cousin to our house to have snacks, drinks, and games while listening to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on television.  Over the years, we have collectively amassed quite a collection of board games.  For Christmas, I had bought Redneck Life as a gift for my aunt, and we played it then (the poor mule Clancy drowned in the lake...).Having enjoyed the game the first time we played it, my aunt and cousin brought it for us to possibly play again for New Years.  They arrived at 7pm, and we started the night with1. Last Word [buzzer broke mid-way through and we didn't finish]2. Clue3. Smart Ass [played 3 times]After finishing those games around 10:30pm, we then decided to play Redneck Life.  It's similar to the game of Life, and we imagined it would last us through to the new year.Throughout the night, we had been eating snacks.  As none of us have ever lost a tooth after a beer bottle rebounds while throwing it out the window of a vehicle, I wouldn't say we had drank near enough to be true rednecks.So, to really get in the redneck spirit, I grabbed two shot glasses for my cousin and I.  I opened a bottle of wine, and he opened a bottle of rum.  We decided that every time I landed on a ""Go Redneckin"" spot, I would take a shot of wine, and every two ""Go Redneckin"" spots he landed on he would take a shot of rum.Midway through the game, reaching for a ""Go Redneckin"" card, I knocked over an empty bottle of beer, which hit my full shot glass of wine, which then drenched a number of ""Go Redneckin"" cards.  Not to worry though!  Wine soaked ""Go Redneckin"" cards class up the game.As midnight approached, the game was almost complete.  Half my bottle of wine was now gone, and a quarter of my cousin's rum was gone.  We weren't inebriated enough for Rev'rend Uncle Pappy to throw a bible at us, but my lips were a little tingly.Five minutes before midnight, we took a pause in the game to open a bottle of champagne, watch the ball in Times Square in New York drop, and to toast in the New Year.The final countdown began... 10, 9, 8.  We raised our, fortunately plastic, glasses with champagne to cheer.  And as the final seconds passed, I watched in surprisingly slow motion as my cousin moved his cup to tap his mother's cup.  My cousin was holding the cup at the very top with his thumb and a finger, similar to how a bucket has a handle at the very top.  His mother, being shorter than he, aimed her cup more toward the lower end of his cup....3, 2... And as their cups came boisterously together, my cousin having perhaps been affected more by the rum than I realized, misjudged exactly where the cups would meet and overshot my aunt's cup resulting in my cousin's cup being pivoted in his hand 90 degrees.  And so, with his cup now horizontal, my cousin splashed the entire bubbly contents of his cup onto his mother drenching her in champagne....1... (fireworks explode on tv) And my aunt, in surprise, exclaims the first words of 2019 - ""Oh s**t!!!""After a moment to process what had just happened, we all burst out laughing.  Having played Redneck life for the last hour and a half, the jokes abounded...""Tha po po won't believe ya haven' not been drinkin tanight!""""I promise I haven' had anything to drink tanight occifer!""and on and on...I was laughing so much my sides hurt.  After things settled down, we finished the game, and my aunt ended up winning with 14 teeth left.New Year's 2019 will undoubtedly become one of the most memorable game nights we will ever have.  So I would recommend this game, and encourage others to channel their inner rednecks.  I'm sure it will result in a good time.",5.0

If you're looking for a hilarious, unique board game to play then this is one you shouldn't hesitate to buy!  This game will have everyone laughing the entire time you are playing with it's funny Go Redneckin' cards, all of the ways you can lose your teeth, and with the surprising amount of young 'ens you can accumulate.  It's a similar set up to the Game of Life board game so keep in mind that this does take a little while to play since you have to travel all the way around the board to complete the game.  I also highly recommend buying the Redneck Life expansion pack¬†

Redneck Life Expansion: Bustin' a Gut! Set

  .  After playing a few times without the expansion pack you end up getting familiar with the rigs and the go redneckin' cards so it's nice to switch it up a little with the different charts, rigs, and go redneckin' cards the expansion set provides.  Brings on a whole new level of fun!  Buy this game, it will not disappoint!",5.0

I whipped it out and the room went one if two ways... excited for the game or so played out if it they didnt want to see it. Being a new expansion everyone gave it a try. As soon as I got to my education I rolled a 3. I knew it was going to be bad from there. Oh man did I not know how bad.For those of you who have played.

It is exactly as it was designed to be and still the funniest, satisfyingly inappropriate game I've played with friends and family. One favorite was becoming mom to 3 red headed step children named Lyle,Lyle Lyle and Lyle Jr. Which I eventually lost due to bad parenting lol.

The first time we played with our family and tween nephews and it was hilarious: I am talking crying laughing. Aside from the laughs, hat was so interesting to us was how the learnings in the game actually impacted the boys in their realization of a few life lessons around education, getting a good job, and the high cost of cars, houses, kids and divorce! So much fun, and added bonus was seeing the light bulbs go off for the kids as they played, when they were realizing the realities of paying so much for lots of kids each paycheck, consequences of decisions etc. it‚Äôs not something we play a lot but when we do it‚Äôs always a good time:",5.0
2283,B000P69H62,R2UBTQN2KU2NBK,Fun game,"  This is a fun game, although some people might consider it politically incorrect. It's similar to the game of Life and it pokes fun at rednecks, people who don't have much money, and people who make mistakes in their lives.  At the same time, it celebrates how creative and funny they can be. You start out the game in deep debt and if you're lucky, you dig your way out, don't lose too many teeth, and don't have too many stepsons named Darryl. It's not so much a strategy game as it is a game to laugh at all the reminders of silly ways people can spend their time and money. The cars and homes you buy are pictures of real cars and homes that are a hilarious tribute to human ingenuity.",5.0

Was fun and humorous.  It took longer to play than I expected, which was actually good. You get to choose your trailer home, rat-rig vehicle.

You'll add red headed stepchildren - all of whom are named Darrell - so make sure to get one large enough.  You lose teeth throughout the game and the person with the most teeth at the end of the game wins. I would recommend this game to anyone!

There was not enough money to pay her with the money that came with the game, So I had her write her earnings on the chart provided.

2290,B000P69H62,R1GPG11R94UVOM,Very Enjoyable!,"  I first played this game at a friend's house for a Ladies Night. We all ended up getting into character by talking with twangs. Unlike the original game of Life, you do not start with money and you won't make it to college. The game has spaces where it looks like you can earn a ton of money ($2 million on one square) but you can never land on it. It is enjoyable to play with an older crowd but not exactly the little ones (since you have the opportunity to sleep with a lawyer). There are some expansion packs with new houses, vehicles, and name combinations are available and each one works with the others. The game is well thought out and absolutely hillarious but a good amount of time needs to be set aside if you want to finish the game as it takes about as long as the original game of Life.",5.0

2292,B000P69H62,R3CC9DS8H2M8DP,"Very fun, but not sure about the ending????",  A very funny game. We enjoyed it. My favorite is the car pictures. The only part that we had a challenge on is the end..... It seems to be too much of a hassle trying to figure out who won. You almost always have debt and also factor in teeth as currency. Just kinda feels too complex for a tongue and cheek board game. I think instead they could have tried another idea for the ending. Maybe an inheritance option or a lucky lotto win,4.0
2293,B000P69H62,R1HA8JIVZC4M49,You will not be able to contain yourself,"  We play this game every so often and we just cannot stop laughing...you know, the crying uncontrollably kind of laughing! It's kind of like the game of Life and Sorry put together. You start out with nothing and have to buy a vehicle and a home on credit, so you basically spend the whole game trying to get out of debt, all the while getting married and ultimately divorced, rolling the dice to determine how many young'ens you have, how many red headed stepchildren named Darryl you adopt and can force upon other players, and how many teeth you lose doing stupid things! Unlike the game of Life or even Monopoly where you can pretty much tell who is going to win by a certain point, in this game it can all change with a single roll of the dice, right up to the end. That's one of the things I like most about this game, you can't be good or bad at it...you just have to take what life gives you! If you really like this game after playing a few times, I would recommend the expansion pack!",5.0

The humor is goofy, tongue-in-cheek silliness, and although there are a couple crass gags this is almost appropriate for all ages (maybe early teens and up).  The addition of colorful pictures of various ""homes"" and ""cars"" was a hilarious addition, and the cards have some very funny material.  My only gripe would be the fixed linear nature of the board, in that every player basically gets married, gets divorces, and gets remarried and, while I see the rednecky silliness implied, that tends to be a little too fixed (in other words, everyone is moving on the board, at pretty much the same pace, and everyone hits the spot where they have to stop and get married, then move on.  Again, I get the gag but it tended to slow the pace and seem just a little contrived in that respect.)  Otherwise this was a hoot.",3.0
2299,B000P69H62,R3P60PQFX12NVF,Doesn't add much to the original game,"  Redneck Life is an inspired, hilarious game. The expansion kit doesn't really add much to it, unfortunately. You get a new sheet of rigs, some new houses, some new Go Redneckin' cards.Well, you might ask, what did you really expect? I hoped for some new humor, some new rule tweaks that would liven up the game. Instead, it's just more of the same. For instance now, when you get remarried, you roll two dice instead of one to see how many Darryls you add. The divorce lawyer costs twice as much. There's a new card to roll for random names. It's just that none of this expansion feels very inspired. Basically you're just going to drive around in a slightly different vehicle with half again as many young en's and finish with even fewer teeth.",3.0

The goal of the game is to have the most teeth left at the end! Similar to the game of Life, you start out the game and get to ""select"" a career, how much schooling that you've had, and your car.  You can lose teeth along the way by getting into accidents... you can lose your car and have to buy a new one, and you can get married and end up with a ton of young'uns and not too many teeth left at the end of your honeymoon.This is a great game, but you can't take yourself too seriously while playing it.  The only downside to this game is that eventually you will run out of the charts where you keep track of your teeth and everything else, but you can always make copies if needed.",4.0

We were all laughing and having a great time.  The new cars were a great addition.  I ended up buying the little $50 car and traded it in a mandatory trade with another player.  Basically, it worked out well.  The new expansion is great because it works with the career pathways in the new cards so that random players get bonuses or screwed.  We did miss the tattoo rule from the original when getting divorced/re-married.  But that's easy enough to add back in.  And I didn't love the new set of names as they seemed like they were trying too hard to make redneck names.  But also, an easy fix.All-in-all it is a really fun expansion.

This was a Christmas gift for my mother, who loves trivia, and the family played it a few times Christmas night. Could we answer all the questions? No, but had we been able to I think we would have been disappointed. I have to wonder if those who didn't like the game were individuals who are used to playing games like Trivial Pursuit and getting the majority of the questions correct, and therefore were disappointed when they couldn't do so with Wit's End.The board is not confusing, as stated in other reviews. With each roll of the die you can move in one of two directions, landing on either a question type or roll again. As long as you answer correctly, you continue your turn. These are pretty basic concepts for this type of game. Rather than collecting pieces of pie, you advance inward on the board, trying to get to the center, by answering a question correctly after you land on one of the squares where two levels connect. The questions are challenging‚Äîyeah, in some cases VERY challenging‚Äîbut even when you get the answer wrong you feel like you've learned something, whereas with other games you either know (or care) about the topic or don't.After each player made an attempt at his or her question, we'd then allow everyone else at the table to take a stab at it, just to see if any of us would have gotten it correct. The different questions on each card are not categories or subjects (e.g. entertainment, history, sports), but instead are different formats of questions, with the subjects being totally random. ""Teasers"" are fun rhyming riddles, ""Odd1Out"" and ""Sequence"" require you to select the one answer of the four that doesn't belong or put three items in order, respectively. ""Wildcards"" can be of any format, but we found the vast majority of the questions we had were to decide whether each of two unrelated statements is true or false. In fact, if I were to have one criticism of Wit's End it would be that there wasn't enough variety in the ""Wildcard"" space, but that could have been the luck of the draw or our perception rather than an actual problem with the game.If you're looking to show off how brilliant you are at trivia, Wit's End may bruise your ego a bit. If you like a challenge, though, and have others of a similar mind to play against, this game can be a lot of fun.",4.0
2338,B00004W60G,R2K2XM5ZZENH64,... 5 star review by saying that two of us like this game and two hate it but I really ...,"  I suppose I should qualify my 5 star review by saying that two of us like this game and two hate it but I really like it A LOT.  It is kind of like Trivial Pursuit, but there are different types of questions, which use different types of knowledge/intelligence to figure out--it's not just about knowing facts (though that's the biggest part of it).  I cannot figure out why the others don't like it and they haven't been able to articulate what they find objectionable about this game.  I think it is really fun.",5.0
2339,B00004W60G,R2WFKXDZCDWK1W,Great game,"  First of all, if your age is higher than your IQ, this game is not for you.  I can definitely say this is the most challenging board game I've ever played, but that's what makes it great.  I bought this as a gift for my brother for Christmas, and I was itching to try it out and we played with the whole family(minus the kids because there's no way kids would be able to answer these questions). It makes you think so hard sometimes that it makes you feel like you're an idiot, especially if you have to answer one of the riddles and can't seem to figure it out.  That's when the answer is something so simple, but you over think it.  Overall it's a great game that gets the neurons firing and is an awesome game if you want to prove you're smarter than your friends or family!",5.0
2340,B00004W60G,R36RTEQWMVZMJX,My favorite trivia game,"  This last summer I bought about 6 different popular trivia games and this is my personal favorite for several reasons.1) The questions are normally moderate in difficulty. Nothing extremely difficult or extremely easy.2) The questions have unique categories: ""Teaser"" which is like a riddle you have to solve, ""Odd One Out"" which is spotting the one that doesn't belong, ""Sequence"" - usually listing some events in chronological order, and ""Wild Card"" - which is usually something like True or False, or Fill in the Blank. Because of the different categories, the game doesn't get stale as fast and if you get bored with one category you can just avoid it.3) In most cases you have multiple choices between picking which category, because you can move left or right on the board.4) If you get the question right, you get to roll again.5) You must land on a space that allows you to move up a level. This sort of evens out the field because a player who gets 5 questions right can exceed a player who gets 10 questions right. Not necessarily ""fair"" but it adds a subtle element to the game other than just who gets more questions right. Some questions are difficult than others, so someone who gets more difficult questions may get less right, and still win.What some may not like about this game:The questions are a little more difficult than most trivia games. At least in my opinion. The ""Sequence"" and ""Odd One Out"" categories often refer to historical events. For example: ""Which one of these events did not take place during Ronald Reagan's presidency?"" -- and the one that doesn't may only be off by a year or two. So, if you don't know a whole lot about history it won't be for you. Younger people won't particularly get too many questions right. However, the Odd one Out and Sequence questions are multiple choice so you still have the odds of guessing the right answers.",5.0
2341,B00004W60G,R3SCMXWC9NKGGE,Fun and simple trivia,"  This is a simple game, roll dice, move in whatever direction you want, try to get to the next tear by answering questions correctly. I assume it could get boring if you play it enough and know all the answers, but that's true of all trivia games. The game play is very easy, so, this game is really about the trivia. There are some very easy questions and some challenging ones, so it shouldn't be too difficult. The questions vary from sports, to music, to theater, to geography, to history and so on; so depending on what you're into, you have an advantage or disadvantage. It's fun if you like trivia and are at least somewhat intelligent. I could see people who aren't intelligent not enjoying the game because they can only get 20% of the questions right.",5.0
2342,B00004W60G,R3M67O274S1UXE,"Awesome game, great for families","  Pros:- Great for families that don't feel comfortable with more complex games.- Good for a diverse age group.- Engaging even during other people's turns, but not so much so that you couldn't take a bathroom break quickly.- The questions are diverse, many different categories are covered. It's also nice that some of the answers can be guessed (as in pick A B C or D), whereas other ones YOU must come up with the answer for. It makes it more challenging and a deterrent to auto-winning for some people who inherently are lucky and could win the game just picking answers.- Simple to learn, very straightforward rules and game play.- The game is fairly re-playable. Each card has several different categories, so even if you go through the whole stack, the next time around you may do a different section of the card, or outright not remember the answer anyway even if it's something you had before. Hopefully they come out with an expansion though.- Shipping was fast and there were no issues with damaged box/bent cards/etc.Cons:- It could be hard or frustrating for a little kid to play. An older kid or preteen could be able to play though. The game says 16 to adult, but I'm sure a bit younger person that is used to trivia games could participate.- The board is pretty simple, it's not the prettiest game in the world.Overall:The game is fun and great for a diverse group of people from all different backgrounds/different interests. I played at Christmas with family. We sometimes have a hard time playing board games together as anything more complex than this, Scrabble, Codenames, Monopoly, or generic puzzles are not liked and too complicated for them. I am a huge board game nerd and love extremely complex games, I was afraid this would be boring but I really enjoyed it.

They usually fall short. I bought this game for my parents so that they would have another game to choose from other than pictionary, during family gatherings. I purchased this game through Amazon and began to play. the rules are simple enough to read once and set them aside. the questions however range from moderate to extremely difficult (IMHO). i especially liked the category of ""Teasers"" where you are given a clever riddle, and must come up with the answer (we allowed 20-30 seconds) for the player to answer before turning the card over. The Teaser questions were most entertaining because it would seem simple to one person and yet difficult to the others and its not always the same people who know the answer. So, it kept the game entertaining and it last for quite awhile. needless to say, none of us were ready for the style, type, or difficulty of questions so after we adjusted, the only thing left was the questions themselves. it made for an interesting evening and i would recomend this product for people who like to be challenged while playing board games.",5.0

2346,B00004W60G,R24Y8FHI8Q4GFK,The people who designed this have no idea what makes a game fun,"  The mechanics of this game are simple -- too simple. But the big problem is how the questions are designed. They are obscure facts or require guesses 95% of the time. E.g., put in chronological order the following inventions... The ones they list are all famous, but occur within 5 or 6 years of each other in the 1800s. No one is actually going to know the years. What's the point in a trivia game that you have to guess? I was able to answer most of the wildcard questions because I'm old and highly educated. My kids (teenagers and young adults) had no idea of the cultural references from (for example) the 60s. Feeling stupid because the questions mention TV shows from the 60s and 70s, books written in the 1700s, and so forth, doesn't make for a fun game for a broad spectrum of people. If you're a boomer and you have advanced degrees, you're going to like this game. Otherwise, you're going to hate it.

So I started looking for alternatives to Trivial Pursuit. I found Wits End and it is a neat new take on the Trivial Pursuit idea. Rather than simply answering trivia questions, Wits End poses the trivia questions to you in different ways (some are harder than others). Great game to play with the family or friends.",5.0

The questions are challenging but not impossible (we're no geniuses...), and they require different types of intelligence, so a person who is good at one type of thing but not another has a chance to get some right.

2367,B01IPUGYK6,RMWWTEYALQTEB,Strategy packed civilization game but maybe too complex for casual game players,"  I got this game in hopes of finding a new board game for my wife and I to play. We both enjoy strategy games and I had read a ton of good reviews about this game so I wanted to give it whirl. After owning this game for a while now, I feel ready to write a review about this game. This is not a game about dominating other players by force. The game dynamics are focused on developing your group and accomplishing your goals. You can choose from a variety of winning, so the strategies can change depending on the group you play and the people you play with. The strategy of the game is not too convoluted to teach other people, but this game does come with a ton of rules. I definitely spent a significant amount of time reading the rules and most specifically about how to take your turn. The rules are well written and make a lot of sense but there are a lot of them. The game recommends to read some of the basics and then give it a try. You can then get a feel for how it all plays out. This works however I found that my wife and I had to stop a lot of times to figure out various issues that came up. Over time we learned how to play and it was fun, however, I find that this game takes a long time and so we are not inclined to pull it out over other games. This game usually takes close to 2 hours for us to play even though we understand all of its complexities. We find that it is easier to play Dominion, Smallworld, or Carcasonne due to their quicker game play. If you are wanting a longer commitment with a good amount of strategy, this is a fun play. It works well with 2 people or more. We have played with others, but does take a long time to explain. If you want a shorter game, it might be best to look elsewhere.If this review has been helpful to you.

2368,B01IPUGYK6,R1COYSZJD9IVRM,"Behold!! Gaze in amazement, as you have stumbled upon the greatest board game, in all the ages!","  Behold!! Gaze in amazement, as you have stumbled upon the greatest board game, in all the ages!  Prepare yourself to be immersed in a glorious steam-punk reality of endless wonder! You my friend, are about to embark on the intrepid journey that is.... Scythe!!  With the expansion pack, choose from 7 different factions, and 7 different game boards to set forth on your quest of glory!  Boost your defenses, conquer your surrounding land, and take no prisoners from your enemies!I've currently played well over 100 games of scythe, which probably clocks in close to 150 hours of total game time.  I can honestly say it is THE most fun board game I've played, and I'm still not tired of it.  Many other board games I will vouch for as being amazing, and I've played them several times over, but at some point, even those games become a little stale, and the gameplay itself becomes boiled down to a science.  Such is not the case with scythe.  It's got just enough random elements to keep it fresh and new every time you play it, without making it so random that you have no control over the outcome.  It's the perfect blend.  And now with its most recent expansion ""Wind Gambits"" the game has evolved anymore.  But for newcomers, don't let the expansion intimidate you.  I highly recommend playing the base game of Scythe for all it's worth (which is a TON) before worrying about playing with the expansion.  I am an avid board gamer, and this is truly a one of a kind game that I have yet to become bored with, and I have yet to dice up into a science.  Every single game will have you attempting new strategies, and exploring new options to declare yourself the victor.  One of the most exciting parts of Scythe is that when the game ends, rarely will there ever be a distinct winner before the final points have been carefully calculated.  There is a Scythe app on iOS and Android that I highly recommend downloading for deciding factions at the beginning of the game, and tallying score at the end.Without going into game play detail (I'll leave that to the rulebook) What I can say is that Scythe is, on the surface, a very complex game, but once you get your feet wet and play it, it really isn't too terrifying to learn.  There's only so much you can do per turn, and once you run through it a few times, you begin to see the gears of the game click and turn, and you'll have a well running engine of a faction in no time!  If you're just starting out with a group of people who are also new to the game, you're going to have your questions and missteps along the way where you might find you weren't playing certain rules down to their very exact intent, but this is perfectly fine.  A lot of the fun in Scythe is discovering all the things you missed, or even may have been doing incorrectly, and changing up your game for the next time.For the most part, Scythe is an incredibly balanced game.  If you get into a rhythm of playing with a core group of people, you'll start to realize the few imbalances it has *cough* Industrial Rusviet *cough* and learn to play around them.  Again, figuring out what each faction is good at, how to make it work with your unique play mat, and formulate the best plan of attack, are just a few of the things that make Scythe such an immersive and brilliant game that will have you wanting to re-rack the game again and again.  Hour and half to two-hour sessions seem like mere minutes when you really start grasp how fun the game is.If I had one gripe about the game, it would be the amount of players  that can play.  It's nice that Scythe can include 7 players, especially if you have a lot of board-game savvy friends who all want to be included.  But be warned! 6 or 7-player games of Scythe tend to drag on, and when that happens, more often than not, one if not more people will lose interest, and thus become unenthused with the game.  And nothing kills the fun of a game, like some one who is currently playing the game and not giving a crap about it.  So if you have 6 or 7 brave souls willing to stick it out, it's best that all parties involved have a vast knowledge of the game, and indeed the actually WANT to play, knowing full well what they are signing up for.  The sweet spot for Scythe, seems to be around the 4-5 player mark.  The games are long enough that you don't feel cheated out of an epic board game experience, but short enough that the ADD in your friends doesn't start to show itself, and manifest into playing candy crush on their phones in between turns.Scythe is a massively wonderful game of strategy that I would absolutely suggest to any board game enthusiast looking to play one of the greatest games of all time.  If new to board games,  I would suggest watching several Scythe tutorials on the internet or playing with some one who has played before and has a good concept of the game.  Again, it's complex, but not so much that I would say anyone wanting to learn the game, wouldn't be able to, regardless of their prior knowledge of board games.  If you're willing to invest a little time to learn this game, you won't be disappointed!!",5.0
2369,B01IPUGYK6,R9C4KRTKRIWGL,Replay Value: 10/10,"  My wife and I bought this game about a month and a half ago, and we've already played it over 10 times now with friends, family, and just between the two of us. Usually, games of this caliber require more players to make it fun, but we have a blast with this just playing two players. There is a great balance of the ""threat"" of battle (actual combat seems designed to be limited, but it's always a possibility) along side of economy building. It has some elements of 7 Wonders and Settlers of Catan in it as you are trying to upgrade your player mat with special abilities as you build resources and conquer the beautiful map.The biggest downsides I can think of is that it's a long game (with two players, we average about 2:15), and if you're trying to teach friends to play, better factor in an additional hour. Besides that, I would say everyone has got to play it at some point. While the instructions and rules are dense, it never felt overwhelming and plays surprisingly smoothly from turn to turn. Haven't had a friend yet who didn't like.My only recommendation is for one person to sit down with the rules and really learn it, because most of the rules can be taught as you progress through the game. Otherwise, it's a beautifully designed game with little to no ""luck"" involved and you feel like the game designer really had a good idea of what this game would feel like when he made it.",5.0
2370,B01IPUGYK6,R2VR73EMMVS20E,It is all about the Structure Bonus tiles,"  Scythe Modular Board is an expansion for Scythe the board game. This expansion comes with a modular board that allows for unique setup for resources (4 hex tiles), home base tiles (7), and Structure Bonus tiles (8).A random side of the board will be chosen before the four hex tiles are randomly placed in their designated areas. The only rule is a lake cannot be placed next to a home base. Following this will have the seven home base tiles randomly distributed around the board with one of the seven tiles being an inactive location. Then a random player mat will be dealt to the players playing. The player will the highest numbered player mat will choose their faction first before proceeding in an descending order. Then afterwards the first player will be the player with the lowest numbered player mat.This expansion gives wonderful variation to the game as players will be able to change the game, and their strategy, with the placement of the modular hex tiles. This variety breathes new life into the game as it really does change strategies and benefits that a player will experience. A flaw in the random distribution of resources can be that a player has a slight edge, or hindrance. For those that have not played scythe enough, or they prefer playing the base map, this expansion also gives eight new Structure Bonus tiles. This is great as it gives variety to the goals players are trying to accomplish in their game. This adds more to the game than the hex tiles as players will be able to add these Structure Bonus tiles to the base game, and The Rise of Fenris expansion. Another small flaws of this expansion is having to play on a smaller board if players had purchased the bigger board for their game. Also, this map cannot fit in the Scythe Legendary box with the Broken Token Insert. So players will either have to carry it separately, or just make the conscious choice of just bringing the modular board. Scythe is a great game and having the choice of changing the board is great, but it was all about the additional Structure Bonus tiles that really made this a worthwhile expansion.",4.0

Tons of replayability.","  If you are a fan of anything in the vein of Catan, or even computer games such as Age of Empires, you owe it to yourself to give Scythe a try. I purchased this on a whim mainly because of the artwork and because I liked the theme of a steampunk 1920s.The game is all about managing workers and resources to build and upgrade your faction. You will build structures, enlist recruits which give you added benefits, and deploy mechs, which, in addition to acting as troops in combat also provide special unique benefits to your faction. While the threat of combat will almost always be looming, it is not a huge part of the game as there are pathways to victory for even the most pacifistic contestants.The board, player mats, and pieces are all of excellent quality. Play time averages about 2 hours. The learning curve is steep at first and the number of pieces can be overwhelming, but after your second playthrough you will understand the mechanics well enough to start focusing on strategy.",5.0
2372,B01IPUGYK6,R1PG5E5OFTCTXZ,Easily one of my new favorite games,"  I was introduced to Scythe about 6 months ago when a friend brought it over for game night for the first time. I was instantly impressed with the board and characters/mechs. I can't remember a board game I've played that is as balanced as this game. There are no dice to role, no luck involved other than choosing your faction and player mat. This game rewards you for efficient moves. If you can get bottom row actions early you'll do well. Each faction has a unique set of abilities and there is not a faction that stands out as ""over powered."" Each faction simply has their own strength and weaknesses.There is a ton of replay value with this game since there are so many different combinations, each game is different. Our group usually plays with 4 people and my wife and I play together and it is still just as fun with 2 people. There is even a single player mode that we haven't tried yet.Fast forward to now, our friend moved away for a little bit so I had to buy my own copy of Scythe because its become a staple game in our house. I would definitely recommend giving this game a try. It reminds me of Settlers on steroids because there is so much more to it. Oh and the pieces are pretty well done, they aren't extremely detailed but they do look very nice. I'd consider painting these at some point.Have fun!!",5.0
2373,B01IPUGYK6,R3UAY0PHIVV3H6,"So far, so good","  Posting a review before I get too busy.The good:Components are good, board is big. Art is pretty.The replay value is strong.The gameplay is quick once you've done a practice round.The solo mode (unfortunately, the only way I've played so far) is challenging and works pretty well. I've lost to it 3 times as I ran through some quick games to learn the rules.The upgrade/build/recruit options are fun and new to me. Almost like they took an RTS PC game and translated it to the board. Each action produces multiple results and keeps you making important decisions.There are tons of choices to make in the game. Almost too many...You'll be constantly challenged to make good decisions so you can't just sit back and coast. I think that, over time, I'll develop a better feel for which methods of generating Coins (victory points) are the most efficient.Good amount of randomness, good amount of player control, no chance for a player to runaway and get too powerful,The not so good:One little wooden heart had an odd edge to it. Kind of ugly but not something I'm going to try to get a replacement for. Especially since it was only that one piece.Only two little plastic component containers. I would have preferred 4 (one for each resource). There are abotut 10,000 tiny plastic bags for holding stuff. I ended up throwing most of them away.Combat is a little bit disappointing considering how awesome the mechs look. I understand why it is the way it is, but you'll have to approach it differently. The mechs aren't actually your military power. They just allow you to USE the power you develop. As a miniature enthusiast, it was a bit of a letdown that such cool miniatures end up playing a less pronounced role in the game.Solo mode is difficult to use at first since you learn all the basic rules, and then have to learn another set of rules on how to interact/run the AI. I think it works best for testing new strategies or getting to know the game. It will get boring eventually as the AI's plan is essentially the same every time: spread out, accumulate military strength then start attacking enemy units. The simplicity is offset by the AI's speed in accomplishing these things. Again, like a PC RTS, you can't let the computer run free or you'll be sorry in the late game.In short. I think it is a great game. I have minor complaints but even with those it is easily one of the most balanced and challenging games I've ever played. It is a bit pricey but it seems that is the going rate for decent board games these days.",5.0
2374,B01IPUGYK6,ROSIOLD3AK4Y3,My girlfriend loves this game so much. She's the one who wrote this review.,"  This game is amazing. I watched so many YouTube videos when I was deciding whether or not to get it. The mechanics and the components are really what caught my interest. Some people might find all the different little components overwhelming but for my taste, it's exactly why I like it. I like feeling physically involved in the games I play. Vs just receiving a card that says I have an upgrade. Instead I have to activate upgrades and move the little cube from one spot to another. The little details are what set this game apart from other board games.As for shipping, I ordered it 8pm Saturday night, received it 11am Sunday morning with amazon prime. The box came with no wear and tear. All the pieces were there and intact. It's a little heavy but it's filled to the brim with goodies. I have no complaints. Except that now I need to buy a bigger table.This is the retail version with wooden resources and cardboard coins. I bought those upgrades separately on amazon as well. A1!",5.0
2375,B01IPUGYK6,R3MT2097SFIIO3,This game is like those paintings,"  You know those thrifted paintings you keep seeing on the internet that someone painted AT-ATs into? This game is like those paintings. It's a rural environment somewhere around WWI, but then there are all of these giant robots walking around.It's honestly a much better game than I thought it would be. My first glance at this game had me thinking that this was another war game, which I'm not a huge fan of. There is war in this game, but you don't necessarily have to fight anybody. There are other ways to win. In some ways, this game reminds of Inis. Both games are about area control, but you don't necessarily have to fight any wars to control those areas. It's refreshing, honestly, not to have to do a bunch of pretend fighting over some pretend, or not pretend, land on a map.It's sort of like economics/worker placement/war/victory points/robots.The artwork is just beautiful and that's coming from a person who doesn't like robots or Animes about people who get into mechanical suits and fight. I don't give one flying flip about Gundam, but I do like the artwork in this game.",5.0
2376,B01IPUGYK6,R3MT139ZTXZS7D,Fun game that benefits from strategy without being too heavy,"  Scythe has been on my list to play for a while, and after getting to try it out it quickly moved to the top of my purchase list.  It has enough strategy to be engaging, but isn't so heavy or complicated which means our whole family can play it.  My 8 and 10 year old enjoyed playing it, but their mom and I definitely had the upper hand for being able to think about longer term goals when choosing moves.Once you understand the mechanics, it is really a simple game and the instruction manual covers almost all of the odd edge-case scenarios and is very well written.  The quality of the pieces and artwork is above average.  Despite being one of the more expensive board games we own, it is probably one of the better values as far as quality and entertainment.I wouldn't go with this if you are new to board games, but if you are looking to expand a new collection this is a great game!",5.0
2377,B01IPUGYK6,RKOPC4DEHS9XR,Essentially a single-player game,"  The production quality of the cards, figures etc. is great, but the fundamental design of the game mechanics is a total failure in my opinion, as there is close to zero interaction between players. I see playing board games as a social event, and this game has hardly any interaction between players other than combat, and the way combat is designed makes engaging in it fairly unfavorable for almost everyone.",3.0
2378,B01IPUGYK6,R2LTQXVCF93MXH,Gorgeous and Exceptional Game: A Worthy Pursuit.,"  Scythe is an incredible board game of economic engine management and territory control. The components are top-notch and the art is absolutely gorgeous. It is an immersive, lengthy game with a rather steep learning curve for casual games. It is suitable for patient adults and advanced adolescents. Expect to spend about four hours familiarizing yourself with the rules and the board, and playing your first game. It may be difficult to play with a large group if your friends and family aren't fully committed to learning a fairly exhaustive (though not particularly intimidating) rulebook. ""Replayability"" is uncommonly high, as well, due to Scythe's rich assortment of ""factions"" and unpredictability. I can imagine nearly infinite ways a game could unfold.Scythe pits factions of power-hungry individuals against each other in an imaginary, post-WWI world of nearly dystopian scarcity. Players assume the roles of characters that represent different nation-states, all of which are vying for resources and territory following a period of sociopolitical unrest. Players can control character movement, select actions to increase resource production, maximize efficiency to gain power an influence, and conquer territories. Your global achievements in these arenas contribute to your final score and the game ends after a player completes six specific objectives. Played poorly, one could conceivably end the game by completing these achievements AND lose.Scythe is unique because skill is valued more than chance. On that note, luck's role is Scythe is kept to a bare minimum compared to other games in similar genres. Resource management, move/turn prioritization, and skillful board mastery are rewarded more handsomely than rote combat, of which there is surprisingly little. Combat interactions are performed using power modifiers that are mostly the result of judicious play. Mine, harvest, trade, bribe, build, conquer, pillage: Scythe has it all in spades.Of note, the ""Automa"" deck - a group of cards and rules designed to simulate a human opponent for solo play - is a world-class production. Its moves are intuitive, and its actions never feel random nor arbitrary. Automa feels like a living, sentient, rational opponent that is always one step ahead of you. Automa's difficultly level is also adjustable from ""easy"" (a loose interpretation of the word) to extraordinarily challenging, and you can buy expansion packs to play against multiple simulated players. It's a great way to spend an evening.If you're up for a completely immersive, steampunk-inspired game that values efficient choices and skill above dice rolling (not a die to be found), I highly recommend giving Scythe a try. It is a complex game of beauty that will soon be heralded amongst the best board games ever created. Very, very well done, Stonemaier Games.",5.0
2379,B01IPUGYK6,R3M7D7EWDISN67,Fantastic game!,"  The game itself is fantastic. Requires a lot of strategy and no luck. Very steep learning curve for new beginners. I absolutely love this game. However, I had to return it twice now because either pieces were missing or damaged. So product quality itself has been disappointing. Hoping this third game has no issues.",1.0
2380,B01IPUGYK6,R1Z3BB3X34X6SM,What's the big hype for?,"  I wanted to like this game, and thought I actually would. The hype around it was crazy and I'm an avid board game lover (the more complex the better!). But to me, it was just too many pieces and rule while at the heart of it was a really simple engine of moving tiny toy characters around. The solo variant was very unique and impressive, but again the actual gameplay left me wanting more.",3.0
2381,B01IPUGYK6,R2EZN0PAX7SE7B,Looks busier then it is. Great game and worth a play,"  This game looks busy, so many little pieces, so many little actions.  However, it's not as it seems.  I don't like overcomplicated games with convoluted rules.  If I buy a game then I expect to learn it and play it, not spending time a college course equivalent of reading through and learning the rules.  For the longest time, I avoided this game because of how busy it looks. Eventually, after hearing the praises by others and a 30 dollar price drop I decided to buy it.  I was surprised to find a very engaging game with an efficient rule set.The system is what makes it work.  If you have played enough games over the years one thing you will notice is how a few of the mechanics are borrowed.  Little bits of other working games fitted in just right, like a recipe for a good meal.  With that in mind, I would describe this game as a two-course meal.  The action mats like the appetizer with the actions playing out on the game board like the main course.  During the game, you will primarily interact with these two mechanics.First the action boards.  They are laminated cardboard, unlike whole pieces, this makes them feel heavier and longer-lasting.  Most of your bits and bobs fit into these mats.  The small squares, most of the figures and buildings start or stay on this matt.  As you play you only be interacting with parts of this mat making things much more easier to manage.  Each section is just two actions so you will never have to deal with more than these two actions.  The main  actions on the top will either give resources or allow you to perform an action on the game board while the bottom the optional action will always cost something but will upgrade something, making things easier later or allowing you to deploy something.  The player mats are mainly for reference and will be interacted with only when needed, like deploying a mech or using an inlist action giving a quick bonus or stat upgrades.The game board, this sucker is huge. Not only that but they have a larger board on the bottom that you can add to.  On the game board, there are resources, tunnels, lakes and even a central factory.  Using your action board you interact with the game board.  Choose a move action and move a piece, choose a deploy action and deploy a worker.  Using a secondary action to build/place a mech. Moving your workers onto a resource allows you to use the produce action to create resources that you can use any time to pay for costs on your action board.  Doing this creates a cycle of production and paying costs to improve your possibilities. You're never doing more than one normal interaction with the game board at any one given time unless you start combat. By moving your character or mechs into spaces with your opponent's pieces starts combat.  In this case, worker pieces will flee and or you fight your opponent's characters and mechs using combat cards and the combat dial.  During gameplay, you will draw cards with numbers bonuses and gain power with the bolster action.  Combat is easy, spend power using your dial and add power cards to add bonuses to it.  Each player has the dial and cards face down, reveals them and the highest numbers win.  That simple.  The loser takes their peace and places them at the home base.  The cost is though if you force workers to flee you will lose popularity, apparently, the people of your employer don't like seeing you bully unarmed people.  Lastly on the game board are encounters.  These are represented by tokens and if your player peace runs into one you draw an encounter card.  These are great.  Each one has three choices that are tied into one another and will put you in the situation to gain something and lose something depending on what you do.  They represent great extra flavor and things that can mix things up.Combat vs peace.  Despite using mechs the game is only one part combat.  The other two parts being production and popularity.  Combat can be useful but it's not the endgame method.  The game is balanced nicely to make it so that no one player can dominate in any one given area, instead of its all about taking what you can do to push past your opponents.  In this way, combat is more of a tool used only when you really need to instead of an end-all solution.  A player can initiate combat just with the idea of placing a star on the victory track or just when you really need to push out an opponent from a strategic spot.  The same goes for resources, you can't win just doing what an econobox does.  You will need to fight sooner or later and worrying about resources gives no direct advantage.Popularity, the final component is how popular your character becomes, despite seemingly small, this is the last third of the game.  In this case the more your people like you the more bonuses you get at the end of the game.  The end goal is to end up the richest among your peers.  You will earn some gold during the game but most of it will come from the popularity track.  The multipliers on this track is a make it or break it, mechanic.  Being down just one tier on this track can break a win.  So popularity is very important and you need to keep in mind throughout the entire game.One thing I want to bring up though is how the game is balanced so it's very difficult for any player to truly know if they are winning.  No single player during this game will be able to say they are absolutely winning.  Only at the final moments of calculations will anyone truly know.  In the manual, it is stated that this is done on purpose.  This is great because it makes for an enjoyable experience throughout the whole game.  It makes it harder for those power gamers of the world to create bad situations and makes it easier for new players to enjoy themselves.  There is a rule in the game that states that at no time should any player attempt to take their turn calculating the other players.  If any player takes more than 30 seconds gauging the other players they automatically lose 10 popularity.  A very large penalty considering that's more than half possible.Overall I have really enjoyed this game despite my previous fears and recommend the base game for any player.  For people who end up a fan than buying the expansions is definitely worth it.  I got this game for 60, a great buy for a game you can easily spend 90 to 100 for at your local shop. The components despite being cardboard, plastic and wood are well made. The components even play into the rules a little to help smooth certain things over.  This game is best for serious board game players but definitely accessible for people who are more casual.  So give it a try and play on.",5.0
2382,B01IPUGYK6,R2AA0RBLIV0S5N,Just buy the digital version on Steam,"  Pros: A 4X Board game, the digital version and community is outstanding, incredible art direction, the turn phases being laid out on player cards is well done.Cons:Poor balance between different factions: two factions have amended rules to decrease their power, but two other factions that are notoriously weak have had no rule modifications to make them on par with the others.There are several turn phases that are easily forgettable that the digital version reminds you of, like passive income from enlistments, bottom row income, etc.Board Hexes are not large enough to contain the a usual number of pieces, (Character, Mechs, Workers, and Commodities take up too much space).There are many, pieces to lose without any spares whatsoever.Room for two additional factions is on the board, but requires an overly priced expansion pack for the value. Further, those factions incorporate very different mechanics further throwing game balance off.There does not seem to be any ongoing effort to create a ""balancing pack"" or 2nd version to address all of the games weaknesses, but instead more after-the-fact rules will probably continue to be implemented.After a steep learning curve, we have been successful playing with other adults. However, the intention of getting the game was to play with high-school students and getting them all up to speed on the rules, with seven players, is just not practical in comparison with similar games.",1.0
2383,B01IPUGYK6,RU6LUDBMJ7SMX,Awesome game!!!,"  Played this game for the first time last weekend.  I had 9 other friends over and we were all new to the game.  After the first ""learning"" game we were  all ready to play for real.  Everyone was thoroughly entertained.  I had to immediately buy it for myself plus expansions and start a Scythe night to keep the fun going.  The game has several different ways to win which helps for the different types of gamers.  Resource management, strategy, aggressive combat, alliances, etc..  Since each one of the factions plays a little bit different and on top of that you have different player resource management mats so can have different experiences each game even playing the same faction.  It has beautiful plastic pieces unique for each faction and even the wooden meeples are nicely done.  I'd really suggests getting the resin/zinc realistic resource package just for the added artisticness of it.",5.0
2384,B01IPUGYK6,R3INTRRQDK7WF7,It's a blast.,"  This is one of the best games I own. The artwork for one is just incredible. The gameplay is quick and balanced. It's hard for any 1 player to really dominate, so expect a close finish.  It also plays close to what they say, i think usually an hour and a half, which is nice for a game night that doesn't take up the whole night.  The biggest issue is a steep learning curve, it's hard to teach people all the intricacies. Also, the combat system I would rate as 7/10.  There is not nearly as much combat as you'd expect, and ironically in a multi player game combat can actually really hurt you more, even winning, as it allows other players to build strength while you possible weaken yours. I actually wish combat played a bigger role than strategy, because the mechs are very well done and you spend a lot of time adding them to the board.  But really a great game with what I consider minor annoyances/setbacks. If you have the money, add it to your collection.",5.0
2385,B01IPUGYK6,R3FPCDCX3WNQE4,One of the best boardgames ever made -> A lot of fun to play,"  TLDR:  Great game, long play time, high learning curve, a lot of fun to playLearning Curve:  It is steep, and it is not punishing.  If you play through the game not understanding all the rules it still functions and feels good to play.  For me it took about 3 full games to completely get all the rules.  Each game we'd learn something we had done incorrectly that changed the gameplay slightly, but never once did we feel like it took away from the games we had finished prior.Time to Play:  This is definitely every bit of 1.5-2 hours.  Longer for the first couple plays I'd say.Gameplay:  Can vary quite a bit based on faction, and each faction breaks the games rules in one way or another.  They did that on purpose to help remind people of the rules, and it makes the game quite a bit of fun.  That said, it is less combat than you'd think unless you are trying to win with combat!  There are many ways and strategies to take as you play.  I cannot speak for single player, as I'd recommend this with other people only.  Don't get it for the single player experience IMO.",5.0
2386,B01IPUGYK6,R3SENSW2Y28KLU,"Very fun, immersive game. One of the best I have ever played!","  Scythe is an excellent game. I could just stop there, because it is that simple. This game has a little bit for almost any kind of gamer. There is strategy, with just enough luck thrown in to make the game fresh and new with every replay. The game is a resource management game, but it also has a war game element that will be fun for war-gamers and non-war gamers alike. The game engines you build and get going for you are so rewarding and fun to develop. The component quality is top shelf as all Stonemeir games are. The game also has a solo player mode that is a lot of fun. The game is immersive and challenging, and will be played again and again. Your first game or two will could take up to 3 hours. They will be a fun 3 hours though, as you begin to see the depth of the game and how many choices you have for game play. Once you know the game, it will take 90-120 minutes to play. More if you play with the full 5 players (or 7 with the expansion).While there is a lot to the game, the instructions are clear, and once you begin to play it just starts to click. The game is not cheap, and yet it is a good value for the quality, fun and reward the game provides.We are full time RVers, and so for us there is a downside, and that is size. The board is massive. Importantly, however, we still to choose to have this game with us because it is just that much fun. We stay in plenty of RV parks that have clubhouses were we can play on big tables. And if we work at it we can manage to play in our RV, or even outside on nice days. It should also be noted with relation to this, the first two expansions fit into the original box, so they do not take up more space.I highly recommend this for anyone who likes board games. Really. Doesn't matter what kind you like, the odds are really good that you will love this.",5.0
2387,B01IPUGYK6,R15N8S0BEMM22S,My New Favorite Board Game,"  This has now become my new favorite board game, supplanting even a game called Agricola from its 3+ year reign as favorite.  My wife and I have played the two player version 4 nights in a row now because it is so fun, and each game is totally unique.  To start the game you randomly draw a faction mat, and a player board (there are five of each and they are all different).  This means there are 25 different combinations of factions and player mats that you could play as.  I love many things about this game from it's compelling alternate history storyline, to the incredible artwork and detail put into every element, and especially the unique game play.  It is a turn-based game of strategy where you take actions on your turn that allow you to do many different things.  There are no dice to roll, so that terrible feeling of being able to do nothing on your turn if the right numbers don't roll (i.e. Settlers) will never happen.  As you play you can upgrade both your playing board and your faction's abilities.  You can choose to stay busy in your own little world or you can attack your opponent.  But the cost of attacking is high enough that the most battles my wife and I have ever had in a single game so far has been three.  I can't wait to bring this game to my next family reunion and play with all 5 players.  I'm already starting to think pretty seriously about purchasing some of the expansions too.  This game is totally worth the $$$ we spent on it and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys strategy board games that don't use the luck of dice to determine whether you win or lose.",5.0
2388,B01IPUGYK6,RHO5Z9X5OZDZI,Watch a YouTube video,"  My wife and I watched a YouTube video before buying that helped us grasp most of the concepts to decide that we wanted to buy it. Once we got it in, we read the rules, played a few times, and for the most part the rulebook will tell you everything you need to know.The game is highly complex looking, but once you learn it, it really seems a lot more simple. There is still a lot to the game.There are a lot of reviews you can read that go in depth. I will just say that if you like a game that every time you play your play style will be different based on the faction you start with, the resources you have available, or the tile you draw (bottom row actions for you character), then you will prob enjoy this game.The board itself has great artwork, the figures are really nice. Already we have hand painted two of the Character figures ourselves.",5.0
2389,B01IPUGYK6,RHU7LBAZ2AVOF,"Great game, but, not for everyone","  My 16 year old son and I love this game. We love the complexity, the game-play, board, cards, everything about the game. But, we know it's not a family game because  my wife and daughter can't be convinced its worth their time. They tried once and didn't finish, never to join us again. We play lots of board games, ticket to ride, Monopoly, Catan, to name a few. But, we can only play Scythe as a family, my daughter and wife don't want to invest the time to learn the game. We usually play two play games which is just as much fun. Occasionally we we have games night party with dozens of friends when we can squeeze in a 5 player game which I found to be even more fun and engaging.If you like complex games with great cards and game pieces, this is worth it. Just don't expect everyone to like it. It's an expensive game to sit on the shelf.",5.0
2390,B01IPUGYK6,R1P3XJ701WF25K,it's an amazing game. I found it more fun just to ...,"  Kinda steep learning curve starting out but once you get it, it's an amazing game. I found it more fun just to play and not worry about actually winning than anything else. For this game it's all about the journey, not the destination.I have now played 7 games. 4 of them the 1 player automata variation and 3 of them with 5 or less people. I can say the game plays just as good with 5 people as it does with 2 or 3. Also the 1 player game is really fun! It changes the way the game is played a little bit for the opposing automa and is really clever.One downside that I have found after playing numerous games. It seems that you really should put more focus into your popularity over everything else in the game. Since popularity has a strong dictation towards final score you are more likely to end up winning over the guy who has completely ignored popularity. That being said the endgame counting up points is by far my least favorite part of the game. I love the resource management and game play and honestly don't care if I win or lose because the fun I have with the game is more than enough for me.Each of the 5 included factions plays differently enough to create replayability in that fashion and there are a variety of game boards to place all of your tokens that change up the way you play as well. This game is all about managing. You have to be aware of your money, resources, military strength, popularity, zone control and a few other random things that change with each game...........I think that is why my wife beats me every.single.time. I go in all playing and just doing stuff willy nilly whereas she really takes her time contemplating what she wants to do. Either way I have a blast losing.The game by itself is strong but I HIGHLY recommend picking up the 2 expansions that are currently out as well for a more diverse play. One of which adds two more factions with very unique skills and the other adds really fun flying ships and different ending mechanics.",5.0

2392,B01IPUGYK6,R2GJUI3VYMBDWL,"Great game, better for two players and large map size leads to rare interaction.","  Great economic game. It seems daunting opening up the box but after a quick read-through of the rulebook the game is pretty simple. My only problem was that adding more people to the game didn't seem to change it much. I played a four player game and because of the large size of the map and lack of incentive and no creation of a disadvantage for opponents upon victory, combat was rare as well as player interaction. Ultimately the game just felt longer instead of like I was playing against multiple friends and battling over resources. The factory can lead to lots of combat but with how easy it is to bolster yourself in combat, there wasn't a huge advantage to owning the factory for the full game as to not get worn down. It was slightly beneficial to own at the end but most of the time I felt my mechs were better suited transporting troops to control more land. Still a great game, just much better suited for two players in my opinion or multiple experienced players that try and take land.",4.0
2393,B01IPUGYK6,R11NX0BYEION8F,Absolutely Stunned and Amazed,"  I purchased this game to play primarily with a group of friends.  The games played typically weren't that advanced (coup, the resistance).  I wanted to delve into something deeper and more strategic.  I looked into game of thrones but that looked a little too complicated.I ordered Scythe based on reviews and learned to play it via Youtube.  This made the game very easy for me to learn and then teach.The game starts out slow when you're teaching people how to play.  However, it picks up and goes faster the second time you play it.  It helps that players can take overlapping turns.The only complaint I've had from friends was ""There isn't enough combat"".  But I disagree and point out that there is more to this game than combat.I was so impressed with this game I have now ordered all 3 expansions.  They were equally amazing!  I also ordered the metal coins and realistic resources.  The pieces of this game are such high quality.Very sad to find out that the final expansion came out so since I'm a latecomer to the game.  I now don't have future expansions to look forward to.",5.0
2394,B01IPUGYK6,R2TC8CJB0N14Y1,game is super interesting and worth 5/5 stars,"  It has all these cool mechanics and ideas and concepts, but at the end of the day it almost feels like everyone is asking how to play it to make sure they'e not breaking the rules.  Yo need like  a whole game under your belt to lean it and by then the game owner (me in this case) is prob going to get kinda bored with this game. There's not even really any fighting considering you only benefit from it twice, so the game is ""solved"" insofar as there's n fighting, but then it does go into play? But not so much because you're not allowed to harass workers off of land unless you hurt yourself (which ends up hurting more than the inconvenience to the other player).I've been told this isn't a real game until you get 5-7 people, but :L",5.0
2395,B01IPUGYK6,R383JJ1KI6MI0W,What a great game!,"  What a great game!! Lots of things to learn, but fairly easy to keep track of because of the player mat, which divides your costs, actions, and benefits logically so you know what's first, second, and sometimes third (fourth and fifth). I like the fact that the game includes combat, but it isn't a major part of the activity, and sometimes doesn't happen at all. Sometimes you just move into a territory with your mechanical war machine and drive out the workers and take the resources. A clever consequence of that is that you lose popularity points by doing so, which is important in the end game. Lose too many popularity points, and it costs you more than you gain by taking the resources.There is also a solo game function (called Automa) with a set of cards that you play against that pretty much guarantees you will be involved in combat. Stock up on military power and combat cards.Did I mention the artwork? Wow. Just wow.",5.0
2396,B01IPUGYK6,R34YC0IB76N27H,"my favorite boardgame, like computer rts style","  Best long strategy boardgame I played. A group of 4 of us played this game, 3 for the first time and the host played it once or twice. So it took like 5hrs to finish. The 2 top players were first time players.What I like about this game is there are many ways of going about. Lot of games if you under stand the mechanic you can win or be very good, plus luck. There isn't much luck in term of dice rolling here, but not all factions are equal, so you got to understand the faction power. I also like PC RTS games like Age of Empire and Heros of Might and Magic so this resource gathering, area conquering and battling is my cup of tea, is it your then that is up to you.What I don't like is some people have AP and can take forever and this is turn base game like most. Not as bad as Duke of Burgundy's AP where you have to put a timer on people.This is my favorite boardgame of right now. Good varies of option play styles, good concept and overall it moves well. It is complex enough but not over whelming.",5.0

This is a great game to play with the kids.For the all reviews of people saying parts don‚Äôt line up, or cheaply made... they are putting the game together wrong... or letting their nostalgia of this game go on a much higher level than it really was!

I'm an engineer and found it appalling at the lack of precision that these cheap plastic parts were made.  This is nothing like the old classic Mouse Trap game you played as a child where things actually worked and pieces were made of thick sturdy plastic!  This whole game is built around things fitting together crisply to make the game work.  One bent or poorly molded plastic piece and the game is essentially junk.  My recommendation is to look for an older used version on eBay.  This was junk and returned the same day I received it...where the part labeled ""thing a ma jig"" snapped onto a post that was angled instead of straight, making the second marble not fall properly.  Junk, junk. junk.",1.0
2399,B00000DMFD,R1LCJ3JF81UX0R,Everyone enjoys watching the mouse trap do its magic.,"  The Amazon exclusive version of Mousetrap is the game we all know and love. Mouse Trap¬†pits 2-4 players against each other as mice trying to navigate through a complex mousetrap. As They build the mousetrap by moving their mice across the board. They also try to collect cheese cards, which allow them to move other mice to cheese wheels which is the bait for the trap. Once the mouse trap has been completely constructed, players can attempt to capture each others' mice in it by setting off. the trap if the trap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game. The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped. The mouse trap Parts are highly detailed and good sturdy quality. Box and game board are good quality.",5.0
2400,B00000DMFD,R3CK1PQEZLPWSP,Rube Goldberg also wrote the instructions.,  Fun game to play at least once or twice but doesn't lend it self to much repeat play with older kids.  However It is fun to play with the mouse trap pieces for a few times.  Instructions are as complicated as the mouse trap but generally straight forward.  Although game is for 2-4 people we successfully played it with 5 by adding an extra piece.  Game is definitely  more fun when players  that have mixed level of mechanical ability.  Game relies on  functional assembly of the trap and  malfunctions add some excitement to game play.  It is not a game to just hand over to small kids as there are many small parts.  It is better to have an older game runner (adult or teen) that can interpret the rules and instructions when playing with younger children.,3.0
2401,B00000DMFD,R34HNE5AE05LE0,Great buy if you wish to re-live the frustration of your childhood!,"  Well, this is still the most frustrating game ever made! Congrats Hasbro for successfully selling the worst game ever made, a second time around!!!I purchased it for my son (in hopes the game would be better this time) and after finally getting it set up, it failed, and failed, and continued to fail. The course will not successfuly work!!! The marble at the top of the course will not roll forward no matter what we try. We even tried various tricks found on YouTube to make it work (tape over the marble hole, adjusting the ""helping hand"") and it has continued to fail and frustrate.So, if you want to re-live the most frustrating game of your own childhood, and pass this painful memory onto your children, go ahead and spend the money!I'm give 2 stars instead of 1 only for the fact that I was able to spend well over an hour of quality time with my son before it turned into a crying, frustrated meltdown...my son was pretty upset too!",2.0
2402,B00000DMFD,R3LYX2LFHH47AH,"Every bit as good, well-made and fun as the original",  The plastic pieces haven't changed since I was a kid (with the exception of the mice). This is extremely well made and the board accommodates the plastic trap pieces very snugly. Treat this gently and it should last for years. Our boys are 10 and 5 and both enjoy it very much. Family night favorite. Who can resist setting up this trap and setting it off?,5.0

If your child is a builder, I would get them this game - they will rate it at 5 stars, which is why I gave it 5 stars!",5.0
2404,B00000DMFD,R3T3CZQNQ0YJED,Sold with broken pieces,"  When I purchased this game, I was not aware that it was used. I have purchased used items before, but the seller was always upfront. I would not have been as upset if it were not for the fact that one piece was broken off inside of another piece. The game would have been completely useless if it were not for the creativity and expert troubleshooting of the entire family. We were able to remove the broken piece, used a Dremmel tool to drill into the two pieces, insert a piece of metal from a paper clip and gorilla glue them together. My 7 year old grand daughter would have been devastated if we had not been able to play the game. In the future do not sell games with broken pieces. Another family might not have been fortunate.",2.0
2405,B00000DMFD,R2FS1N0J9KXPUT,Nostalgic,"  I remember playing this game when I was a child and when I saw it again I just knew I HAD to have it, and let me tell you, it is every bit as awesome as I remember it being! <3For me, everything about this game is a fantastic thrill-ride! I have a blast setting up the contraption every time I open up this box and even more-so when we get to playing and see all the pieces working one after the other.If you've never played this game or have ever considered it (whether as a kid, for kids or just to relive those nostalgic times), I would definitely recommend this game. And actually, when it comes down to it, this is also a pretty educational game since it teaches kids to follow instructions as well as what it takes and how it feels to construct something themselves. Although, just make sure they are supervised during play since there are plenty of tiny pieces that could become hazardous in the wrong hands >_<",5.0

We did break a small peg on the bottom of the slide the very first time she took it apart but it still works so I didn't exchange or anything. We've playing 20 or more times since with no issues so I'm hoping it will hold up to wear.Update: A year later....We now have too many pieces broken to play the game which is unfortunate because it was their favorite.

2407,B00000DMFD,R35QTAU7YAW1OL,HUGE WIN,"  I have a very active 7-year-old boy and wanted to find family games that might keep him interested. Santa brought us this one and oh. my. word. It is perfect.My older sister had this game when we were growing up, but I didn't actually remember much of the actual gameplay. I didn't read the game instructions at all first. We popped open the box, dug out the assembly instructions, and pieced the whole game together first. I think it took 30 minutes or so. Then, I read the instructions and saw that you're supposed to build as you play the game. Oops. However, in hindsight, I'm actually really glad I made that mistake because by the time we actually played, we understood where everything went and were sure we had all the pieces. Plus, it really built up excitement for my son. He got how the game worked, and so he put up with the actual gameplay purely because he loved building and setting off the trap repeatedly.Therein lies my only gripe. He insists on setting off the trap every. single. time. one of us lands on the space to set it off, even if nobody is on the space to get caught, and it takes a couple minutes to put it all back together. For him, this is the absolute highlight. He delights in setting it off. For me, and my mom brain... it was initially just more work. But, again, I have never seen him so happy and so engaged in a board game in my life, so I kind of learned to delight in those moments too. He and his 10-year-old sister have now happily slaughtered me repeatedly.Other reviews mention the quality... we didn't have any issues and the pieces are as I remember them.  This will be in our collection for quite some time.",5.0
2408,B00000DMFD,R3MJU2AQXFPBB5,Fun game! Set up is Finicky.,"  This game is so much fun! Just like I remembered from my childhood except for the colors of the board. Overall the contraption works, the only problems I had was with the stairs and the slide (the ball would get caught between the stairs and slide and you had to push it to continue on). I think the placement of the stairs and slide was a little off. The slide also wouldn‚Äôt stay all the way in the piece it connects to either. Also be warned The blue piece that the ball hits has to sit just right on the ledge or it won‚Äôt work.So it does really work but Is a bit finicky. I would not give this game to any child who gets frustrated easily.",4.0
2409,B00000DMFD,R1YEMUQ1SFM37T,So flimsy,"  I loved this game as a child.  As an adult with two children, I'm extremely disappointed in the quality of this game.  The ball rarely makes it through without help.  The pieces don't line up right and there are parts that the ball never actually trips (the upward hand for example).  The kicking foot you can't install the parts exactly or it misses the cup.  You have to slightly twist the way they're sitting in order for the foot to make contact.  It's a real bummer when you are trying to show a  6 year old how to put things together then explain that they can't really put them together ""correctly""There seems to be different versions of mousetrap out there, the parts look different.  This particular one, I'd steer clear of.",2.0
2410,B00000DMFD,R1MUA5Z5MGCLB2,Not worth it at all!,"  I rarely give low ratings, but this game deserves it. I bought this for my children with some old memories of playing when I was a child .. was disappointed right from opening the box that everything was plastic, and clearly of the cheaper mass-produced type. As we struggled through the first game, our enthusiasm kept going down .. from looking unsuccessfully for the rubber band that was supposed to be in the box, to scrambling to find another piece that we finally discovered in the garbage as it looked exactly like the throwaway plastic pieces that held the other cheap plastic parts.When we finally got to the point in the game when the mouse trap was built and someone finally hand to turn the crank ... nothing. The plastic parts had shifted on the board. So, reassembly and then I held the board down on the floor as my daughter turned the crank .. to watch the metal ball careen down the too-short track and in 2 seconds trip the trap.We put the game away, and went back to Monopoly.",1.0
2411,B00000DMFD,R2RX3DCBE8DLSL,3D games are fun.,  Really like the game. Just 1 gripe... The turn crank board spot... It's unclear on how this is played. Do you spam cheese on 1 turn or use 1 cheese once per turn or are you forced to move from that spot once you don't spend any cheese. The directions for this spot are horrendous.But other then that... The game is well made. I had no problems with any of the pieces and worked 100% of the time (15 trap triggers).,5.0

We all like to play it together.  The only thing that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that the part of the trap that is shaped like a hand on a pole and is meant to knock the ball further down the track does not work very well.

2413,B00000DMFD,R22PJNES53AOPJ,Lousy quality,  Why are board games made with such lousy quality today?!?!  I feel like all board games are cheap and have gone down hill in this age.  Do manufacturers not realize KIDS play with board games so should at least be made with some durability for a game that is supposed to be played over and over again?

I bought it and it showed up and it was time to have fun. But you have to build the whole thing. Halfway through I realized why this was my favorite as a kid but why my parents never wanted to play.

2457,1988884047,R1JRQHAGD4F9S0,Best game in my collection,"  Brass Birmingham absolutely lives up to expectations. Let me first talk about the art. The main board and player boards are probably my most favorite components. Whether you choose to play the light or dark side, I feel the look really brings this one to shine on your table. The buildings, cards, and resource components are all top notch. I love the beer barrels especially.But where the game really shines is in the play. This one really challenges you to build the best economic engine. You have an incredible number of options on your turn. For this reason, I could see this being a challenge for new players. But as you learn the game, the choices become more clear. The choice of which cards to play from your hand, and when, is absolutely amazing. You are constantly fighting over locations, routes, and resources with the other players.Planning is critical, as you realize that halfway through the game you will lose your level 1 buildings and your canals. What you do in the canal era will dictate how you will fare in the rail era. The players who plan best will start the 2nd half of the game on a strong foot. It's a great game for those who enjoy looking ahead and putting themselves into a position to succeed.While some may complain at the length of the game (it can take 2-3 hours with 4p), I find the game never tires and will always have a place at my table. This board game will NEVER leave my collection!",5.0
2458,1988884047,R3RLXSQ19IC9FD,"Remarkable, deep game (with the added bonus of excellent customer service)","  We are a family of board gamers, and this is easily the best in our collection. It seemed daunting at first, as there are a lot of what *look* like fiddly little rules. (E.g., if you need beer to complete a certain transaction, you need to have an appropriate rail or canal connection to it *if* it belongs to an opponent, but not if it belongs to you.) But once we played through, these rules not only started to make sense in a way that made them easy to remember, but also gave the game strategic depths that it is going to take *many* playthroughs to plumb. There is an exquisite balance between making decisions that will grow and enrich your own little industrial empire vs moves that will sabotage your opponents' efforts. And thanks to the random element provided by the card deck, no two games are alike. It's a bit like Catan, taken to 11 (though as good as Catan is, the comparison doesn't really to B:B justice).Finally, Roxley's customer service is *excellent*. We lost two of the game pieces in short order. (It doesn't help that we have two dogs who view things-that-fall-on-the-floor as treats, pretty much regardless of their nutritional value.) I wrote to Roxley asking if we could buy a ""backup"" set just of the game pieces ‚Äì and they just went ahead and sent us one for free!

2475,1988884047,RQZQZVUYNDN8Y,Manage your industries to maximum potential!,"  Disclaimer ‚Äì Skip to the end for the ‚ÄúFinal Thoughts‚Äù to get a snapshot version of this review2-4 players, CompetitiveOverview-This game is all about properly managing your economy. You will be building up various factories, breweries etc. and trading those goods to specific border cities on the game board to try to achieve the most victory points possible. It‚Äôs all about finding the best and most efficient way to do this to maximize your points.Win Condition /Length-To win this one you just need to have the most VP‚Äôs (Victory Points) at the end of the game. To achieve this you will need to be very strategic and efficient during your actions, which I‚Äôll explain more later. This game can be played with 2 players which took us a little over an hour and a half but as you start adding more players up to the maximum of 4 the game will take longer as each player has his/her own player board to contend with. There can be a bit of analysis paralysis for those that like to really think about their move; however your hand of cards does limit that to some degree.Components ‚ÄìExcellent quality components here. The cards all feel nice and the tokens are of a good quality with some wooden squares for the iron and coal tokens and some wooden beer barrels that are shaped like little barrels. The cardboard stock they use for the player board tokens are thick and feel very sturdy.Setup/Takedown ‚ÄìThe setup takes quite a while for this one. The card setup is rather fast as you just lay down the wild cards in their respective parts, shuffle the main deck and deal cards to each player and place the rest face down in its spot. The MEAT of the time it takes to set up are the individual player boards. Each player gets a board and on these boards you have to place all the industry tokens that you will use throughout the game. There are 29 different spots for these tokes and 4 or so of each specific token goes per spot, in a specific numbered order. So you can imagine that dumping out a bag full of these tokens will take you a bit to find and sort them out to put them in the correct place. Once you are finished with that you are pretty much ready to go!The takedown of the game is much quicker depending on how you have the game sorted. You can go the route of individual bags for each player‚Äôs tokens (there are 4) or you can opt to try and sort out each individual industry token by type (there are 6). The latter will make the setup quicker but at the same time will increase the time of takedown. As an aside there are 3d printed storage trays people have created that hold all these tokens perfectly and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if something like this hit mass market eventually. But as far as the game comes, you will have to deal with baggies.Box/Storage ‚ÄìThe box is on the small size and honestly nothing really stands out about it. Also since you will more than likely be storing most tokens in plastic bags you don‚Äôt really have to worry about stuff getting mixed up.Visual Appeal /Theme‚ÄìI REALLY love the visual aspect of this game. The board looks amazing with the style and artwork. Not only that but the main game board and all the player boards are double sided. One side has the darker artwork of nighttime complete with painted on lit lanterns and the other has the day time look and feel to it. This doesn‚Äôt change the gameplay at all but it‚Äôs these little things like this that really stand out to me with games. The theme is really great as well, taking place during the industrial age of England with various city names adorned on the game board and the surrounding landscape painted in-between with the railroad and canals painted to connect the cities. The outer edges of the board have very elaborate drawings for the VP track and everything just looks‚Ä¶.fancy. This is a very beautiful game indeed.Rulebook ‚ÄìThis game is deep, no doubt about that. Luckily the rulebook does a great job of explaining it! It is fleshed out with pictures and good easy to read descriptions. As with most games you will more than likely need to grab it and search for specific rules of things as you play the first couple times but everything is easy to find with areas bolded for ease. Also included are directions for an introductory game for your first time playing to make it a little easier on you and a section of ‚ÄúBeginner Tips‚Äù which is awesome.Table Presence/Game Board ‚ÄìI talked about the game board a bit above and how great it looks and it just looks even cooler once you start playing and getting your industries set up along with your networks. As you build out the game you will remove those tokens from your player board and place them on various spots on the main game board. This will create your network for your economy. The board is a pretty good size and when combined with the players‚Äô boards it does take up a decent amount of space on a table and that‚Äôs not including the space you need for the money tokens and other iron and coal chits.Table Talk/Fun Factor ‚ÄìI loved playing this and found it to be extremely deep. This might turn off some players who prefer a more simple straightforward game but the turns were easy and fun and honestly this game is only as complex as you make it. That may sound kinda weird but you can go in and just have a ball of a time building up your industries however you want based on what city cards you have in your hand OR you can really get down into it and plot out strategies to REALLY maximize those cards to their fullest potential and monitor what the other players are doing as well. I played with my wife who is a freaking master of strategy games (who also figured out a clever strategy about halfway in) and at the end of it she only ended up winning by 8 VP‚Äôs which is a very narrow margin as we both lapped the full VP track once already.And even though you are playing your own player board you do end up having much discussion around the events happening on the board between other players. I went into this game thinking I wouldn‚Äôt be doing much table talk but as it turns out this one creates all kinds of interesting discussions based around other players‚Äô actions.Optimal Player Count ‚ÄìThis is one of those rare games that I think any player count is optimal and here‚Äôs why. At 2 players the game is scaled back a bit as you cannot use the full game board or the full amount of cards. This is done to create that sense of interaction/competition with the other player. When you go to 3 players another section of the main board opens up as well as more cards added to the deck to draw from. And finally at 4 players the full board is open as well as all the cards to draw from. Personally I think you will get the same experience from the game no matter which player count you go with, with the only big difference being the game length. The more players, the longer the game.Final Thoughts ‚ÄìI‚Äôve said it before that I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of VP‚Äôs and those styles of victories in games. But this one really stands out, and honestly it actually quite a bit of fun just playing the game and not having to worry about VP‚Äôs until the end. And then the excitement when you tally up everything and see who came out on top. I really love that tension it creates. The artwork is just amazing and the theme and feel of the game is great. Thus far this is my favorite strategic economy board game I have played.",5.0
2476,1988884047,RNZ5YCZV4UY1Z,Brass: Birmingham: Brilliant!,"  Brass: Birmingham is a brilliant, beautiful strategy game.It's the sequel to Brass: Lancashire, but you don't need any familiarity with the first game to enjoy this one. You just need to be ready for intense economic strategy. Everyone I've introduced to the game has said they want to play again. The gorgeous art and quality components make it a pleasure to see and touch.The box says it takes 1 - 2 hours, but when people play for the first time, I've found it takes around four hours, plus another half hour or so to teach.Building and improving industries, building canals and railroads, taking loans -- every turn has fascinating choices. Demand for commodities depends on what other players are doing, so you have to pay attention to what's happening during everyone's turn.Randomized market demand means every game plays out differently. The game scales elegantly for two, three, or four players.For players wanting some complex, crunchy fun, I can't recommend it highly enough.",5.0
2477,1988884047,RUIF1L604KKLT,Making it Big in the Industrial Revolution - Board or Bust Review,"  In Brass: Birmingham players are budding entrepreneurs competing with each other to make the best business decisions. Over two eras (1770-1870), you must build travel routes, start enterprises, and sell goods to meet market demands. In the end, whoever scores the most points will be considered a business man/woman for the ages. Will it be you?Number of Players: 2-4Play Time: 60-120 Minutes-Setup-To setup the game, you first have to make the HUGE decision of the day side or the night side of the board. This makes no gameplay difference but it is what you will be staring at for the next 2 hours so choose wisely. Then you shuffle the deck of cards (using specific cards for your player count) and lay out the merchant tiles. Finally, you have to take all the buildings in your player color and sort them onto your player board. Everyone draws 8 cards and you are good to go!-Gameplay-Every round, except the first, you will take 2 actions on your turn. To take any action you must first discard a card out of your hand. The cards will show either an industry or a city. What is on the card is only important for the build action.On your turn, your choices are:Build - Discard a industry card to build in any city with space for that industry as long as it is in your network or discard a City card to build in any of the spaces for that city regardless of it is in your network or not.Network - Discard any card to add a canal or rail link to expand your network.Develop - Discard any card and some iron to remove industry tiles from your player board.Sell - Discard any card to sell cotton, manufactured goods, and pottery.Loan - Discard any card to take a ¬£30 loan and reduce your income by 3 fields.Scout - Discard any 3 cards to take a wild industry AND wild location card.At the end of your turn you draw back up to 8 cards. When every player has taken their turn the round is over. New player order is determined by who spent the lowest amount of money and then you take income.The game is played over 2 eras (canal and rail). When the draw deck and players hands are empty the era ends. At the end of the first era will be a scoring. After scoring you remove all canal network links and all Level 1 industries and then you start all over in the rail era. When the rail era ends you score one more time and whoever has the most points wins.-Components-Full Disclaimer: I have the Deluxe Edition of Brass Birmingham so my Components may be different.In the box there are: 76 Cards, 48 cubes representing coal and iron, 15 beer barrels, 180 industry tiles, and 70 poker chips. In my opinion this really is a deluxe edition. The cards are thick and have a linen finish. The board is double sided with gorgeous artwork. The poker chips for the money is a nice touch but also completely unnecessary.-Final Thoughts-Brass: Birmingham is a tough economic game. It is an open sandbox and doesn't hold your hand by giving you any directions. It is completely up to you to figure out how to make the cards, board layout, and other players actions work for you. This is a heavy game in my opinion and not for the light-hearted. I love the art direction in this game but I can't figure out why they would make the score track and the income track the same track. That means with 4 players you have 8 different tokens on the track around the board and it can be quite confusing. Another con could be that this game will lead to long bouts of AP for some players. As for player county scaling, I mainly play at 2 (My wife and I) and it works but the board is more dynamic with 3-4 players. This is a great game but is not something I would want to play all the time and I'm not sure how long it will stick around in my collection.I would give Brass Birmingham 3 top hats out of 5.Board or Bust Scale:1 - I would never play this again. I would not give this away as a gift.2 - I would play this game if someone else had a copy but I would not buy it for myself.3 - I would ask to play this game on occasion. Would be happy to receive as a gift or in a trade.4 - I would purchase this game for myself. I can see this getting to the table a few times a year. Always enjoy myself when playing.5 - This is exactly what I want out of a board game. Would never turn down a game and would ask to play regularly. Hard to imagine ever getting rid of this game.",3.0

2487,B00628K9BY,R37L87KXI16HQV,Finally! Thank You Olive Films!,"  I tell you what, man, back in 2006 Fox announced that the seventh season of KOTH would be coming out on dvd soon. 2007 came and went, no dvds. Fox announced that they scrapped their plans to release any more seasons of KOTH. Dang it, man, Dang it! The fans went crazy and petitioned Fox to please release KOTH but we just got ignored. That is just bad business Fox, dirty pool, Fox, dirty pool. Now listen up Fox, at Strickland the customer comes first. That is right, the customer comes first.

2488,B00628K9BY,R3TV1NS6OSY9X0,Olive Films Cons,"  If you didn't already know, King of the Hill DVD releases from Fox ceased after season six, and years later the rest of the show was released by Olive Films. While it is nice to be able to own the whole series, Olive Films season seven set has some minor differences that I'm sure fans who own seasons 1-6 would like to be aware of. First off, while the discs are single-sided and don't require flipping like the previous sets, there is a slight loss in picture quality as a result. I watch the show on a 65"" 4K television, so those with lesser displays may not notice, but on my end the picture is not as clear, there are a lot of noticeable jagged lines, and there are quick instances of visible interlacing. These are not issues I had with the previous sets, and they don't warrant skipping out on this release, but they are worth noting. Also, there is no longer a chapter break after the opening theme song, so while I could hit ""Skip"" to bypass the intro on previous sets, I cannot on the Olive Films season seven release because it will bring you to the mid-mark of the episode. Instead one must manually fast-forward if they don't want to see the theme song before every episode.",4.0

I'm not a big fan of digital distribution so when I herd they were being released on DVD a few months ago I instantly  pre-ordered.Both season 7 and 8 feature nice packaging in the style of normal size cases with a swing flap that I personally prefer over the older style fold outs or slim cases. The artwork is nice and colorful. The cases are clear and an episode list is printed on the reverse side of the art work.I was happy to see that the three discs are single sided and not flippers. They house about eight episodes a disc. The only small drawback for me is that there are no bonus features at all. I am still extremely happy with everything else.

I'm clinging on to the hope that the remaining three seasons will see release on DVD before the end of the year.

The horses are made from very cheap plastic where as our friends game board had heavier quality, almost metal feeling horses. At least 4 of the gold metal things in the holes are bent and the horses won't sit in the hole correctly. The game board labels are bubbled up in several places and are lifting on the edges. Our friends game board was of much higher quality. When you spend $90 on a slab of wood you expect the details and gets pieces to be top notch!!!!",1.0

I waited to get this as a birthday present for myself with the gift cards I received. The quality is there but it is a little disappointing for this price how some corners were cut. For example, the horse numbers are not painted on, they are decals that you need to put on yourself and some of the labeling on the board is a pre-applied decal instead of paint which would add a ""heirloom"" quality to it.But the gameplay itself and the fun had while playing is great. We have played with just my family of 3, and we have played with a party of 10. All ages get into it. Everyone is shouting or groaning at the roll of the dice and when the 12 horse comes out of nowhere to win it is exhilarating or crushing depending on who holds the Queens.I would recommend having a set of poker chips available or A LOT of coin change on hand (nickels, dimes, and quarters) especially for larger groups.",5.0

Really a lot of fun once you get going and the more players you have the better. Easy to play, everyone gets involved and by the time the winning horse crosses the finish line, people are cheering like you're at the real races!  So, my complaint is with the cheap plastic horses. Such a contrast to the super nice, real wood playing board. A few (like 4 or 5) of the horses we received had pegs that didn't fit correctly in the metal lined holes on the board. Some fit so tight that you couldn't pull them out. I imagine that the metal sleeves are all made with more exacting dimensions. I had to shave the peg on one the horses just to get it to work - of course now it's too loose...but playable. Other than the sticky fit of the plastic horse pegs, this game is worth getting.",3.0

I was a little shocked by the price,  but we wanted to own one ourselves to play with friends and family. I splurged for the Walnut and it‚Äôs beautiful. My only complaint would be the horses. I wish they were metal instead of plastic. A few of them fit tightly into the grommets which makes them hard to remove and chips away at the plastic a little. We just try not to push those pieces in as far. If you like this game and are on the fence about spending the money, it is worth it. I looked online for a cheaper version, and well, you get what you pay for. I had to return it for defective pieces and poor construction. You won‚Äôt be disappointed with this set.",5.0

2548,B074YN5CKM,R1ZF7ZS7V2LF4E,Captures the Essence of the Video Game Perfectly in a Streamlined Board Game,"  Absolutely fantastic! It really delivers that classic civilization video game experience in the format of a board game. Obviously, there have to be major differences to allow this format change but it capture's the games essence very well. Like the video game, it's complex with endless choices and possibilities, yet also streamlined and very easy to play after the first play-through/learning game.Pros: - Very fun, games typically take around 2-3 hours which is not too long, but long enough to feel like the world/game actually evolves - Captures the video game's essence very well - Endless choices and possibilities - Map creation element generates countless random maps for a different setup every game - Turns can happen fairly rapidly, so you don't need to sit around waiting for other players too longCons: - Tons of pieces/tokens and the box doesn't come with anything to store them and keep them separated - Setup takes quite a while (at least 15 minutes) - Wish the game supported up to 6 people (hopefully there will be expansions!) - Wish there were more victory scenario options - Rule-book is a little more complex than it needed to be",5.0
2549,B074YN5CKM,RATJLD3I019EK,So many pieces,"  Very involved, steep learning curve, all the pieces! Many things to keep in mind while playing, many ways to win, never the same game twice, very versatile game board, many different leaders and wonders that give handicaps or benefits that change even more aspects. All of these features mean you have to keep in mind a lot of details and make this game something you'll play with the same people over and over, it's not a quick board game for a party. They did a fairly good job of keeping a lot of classic civilization functions in a board game format. Good quality materials, pieces function well, but you may want to purchase a lot of little zip lock bags or some sort of organizer to help with game set up. There is one red wonder that seems to put the win in the bag for the player who gets it first. This one allows any card's action to be played a second time if you originally played it in the fifth slot - this basically means you play twice every turn if you set it up right and gives a major advantage that does seem unevenly overpowered compared to other wonders. No regrets in buying this though.",5.0
2550,B074YN5CKM,R23ABCNKD7FSK8,"Streamlined, but still sluggish","  The good:* A fast-paced strategy game that captures the ""feel"" of playing Civilization on the computer while taking less than 2 hours.The bad:* Looooong setup (30+ minutes), even if you're sticking to the ""For Your First Game"" map in the rulebook.* Lots of easy-to-forget rules. Even after several play-throughs, I have to look things up constantly. For example, how much defense does a target have? If it's a barbarian or a token, it's the terrain value. If it's a city, it's double the terrain value, unless it's a city-state, in which case it's 8 (?). The backs of the leader cards provide a quick-reference for the victory conditions; for everything else, you have to break out the manual.* Combat feels like an accounting exercise. You each roll a die, and then you add all your bonuses: ""I have 4 from my tech, 2 from this wonder, 2 from this city-state,"" ""I have 3 adjacent reinforced tiles, 2 from this wonder,"" etc.I was excited for this game at first, but after a few plays it doesn't feel worth the effort.

I was really surprised by the pace of the game and how smoothly it moved along. Combat was a bit too simple for my tastes, but there was still plenty of strategy involved in gameplay. An earlier reviewer commented on the amount of pieces (there are A LOT), and while I solved the organization problems by sorting them into sandwich baggies, there were a lot of sandwich baggies. Hopefully this helps speed up setup, as I put the pieces for each player in it's own bag. In spite of the volume of pieces, during play they weren't encumbering in any way, which made everything a breeze. Really had a great time playing with my teenagers, and I hope you do too.",5.0

I‚Äôve played both the console and PC versions of Civ and it keeps that same feel and excitement. I would highly recommend for Civ lovers looking for some offscreen time.

2560,B074YN5CKM,R1GPUCIAZOX47,"Lots of fun, complex without being overwhelming","  What a great game! Setup takes some time but moves much faster once you get the hang of it. The learning curve is based mostly around the cards, which detail the actions you can take each turn. Knowing what they do and how to upgrade them throughout the game takes a lot of time during your first few games, so plan on 3+ hours, possibly 5+ if you have four players all learning together.I'm really disappointed with their support, though. Two of the ""Tech III"" cards have a printing error, switching the military art and title with the Industry art and title. I reached out and they flat out refused to fix it, and they aren't fixing it for future prints either. If you buy this, prepare to be disappointed in the inaccuracy.I'm also assuming that expansions are out of the question, which is really unfortunate.

There is a little more substance than Catan or 7 wonders, however, it is not as heavy or complicated as it‚Äôs predecessor.  For best enjoyment, do not attempt to compare it to the 2010 Civilization Board Game. Each is very different, each takes a different approach to capture the Sid Meier‚Äôs Civilization theme. I would recommend both to your collection. Civilization a New Dawn is a great game if you want a reasonable quick civilization building game.

There are sooooo many pieces. None of us play video games but we all love strategy board games. Skip this one.

I was expecting lots of gross foods--but I was surprised at the inappropriate cards--eyeball, human burger, blood salsa, and fresh brains.  Those are not foods that typical people find in their refrigerators.  We do not practice cannibalism.  She was very upset when I suggested that we just take out those cards.  I seriously wonder who thinks that those cards are appropriate for kids.  The rest of the game is funny, but I wish I would have looked through the cards before I gave it to her.",1.0
2654,B07JZTBV9C,R1AD4QP6UZKZK3,"Quick and easy, great for families; see NOTE for box lid opening hack","  Taco vs Burrito plays a lot like Uno, but with funnier cards.  Much like Uno, you can sabotage your opponents, or be nice; whatever suits your playstyle.  You can totally play with only 2 players, but more people means more opportunities for mischief and mayhem!Pros:- easy to learn how to play (each Action card tells you how to use it)- setup and teardown are super simple (no dice or color-coded gamepieces to lose and step on later)- gameplay is quick and easy (10 min/game; no Monopoly marathons here!)- amusing food ingredients (creative/gross foods will give you a chuckle)- once you master the basic game, there are many variations that keep the game interesting- my 7-year-old does enjoy this game a lot, and I don't mind playing 1-on-1 (it's more strategic and exciting with more people)Cons:- the game box is ridiculously hard to open, for some reason.  See NOTE below for a quick hack fix.- I feel like there should be more ingredient cards. Perhaps that is what is in the expansion pack?- you choose to build either a taco or a burrito, but the choice does not affect gameplay *at all*. I feel like it should, though. If I think up a game variation that does, I'll post it here on a later edit.- considering you're basically just getting a pack of funny cards, I feel that $20 is a little expensive. I would have been fine with paying $15 or so.Bottom line: This game is easy to learn and fun to play. It's great for when you want to play one or a few quick games with family or friends. It would make a good gift, especially if you can get it on sale.NOTE: The game box lid creates a vacuum or something that makes the box really hard to open. So what I did was take  a square of clean aluminum foil (about 1 foot x 1 foot) and fold it over itself several times to make a strong strip roughly 1 foot long and 2 inches wide. Then place the strip horizontally *underneath the plastic tray* in the box (please see the attached photo). Tuck the leftover ends under the box bottom to hide the aluminum strip when the box is closed and in storage.When you want to open the box, just untuck the ends, balance the box on your leg (or have the other person hold it), and pull *downwards* on both of the ends of the aluminum strip *equally*. This downward motion will push the plastic tray upwards, and the lid will magically float up and pop off. You don't need to use a lot of force! Alternatively, you could just open the box normally, as the aluminum strip breaks the vacuum seal and makes it much easier, but where's the fun in that? :)If you found this review to be helpful, please click on the 'Helpful' button below so more people like you can find it.

2655,B07JZTBV9C,R3UYSE5OJHJ98K,I laughed myself into an asthma attack!,"  Ok, this game is legitimately hilarious, and devious enough to bring out people's competitive nature! It says a round is roughly 15 minutes, but we kept reshuffling the trash pile, so the round wound up being closer to 45.It's SUPER easy to play -- you literally deal the cards and start playing because instructions are written on the cards themselves. We had a few scenarios where we had to adapt as the game went on, namely with the ""Food Fight"" action card. The deck has so many action cards that it was hard to draw ingredient cards for the Food Fight, so we decided that action cards are just Null rather than to keep drawing until you hit an ingredient. Simple adjustment.The game itself is perfect for family night since it's easy to play and the gross ingredients appeal to a kid's sense of humor. But my friends and I are all mid-30s and we still had a blast! After the third time getting ""Health Inspector,"" one friend started cursing. Our other friend, who is a notorious trash-talker when she plays spades, called me a ""heifer"" when I smacked her, once again, with Tummy Ache. Did I mention this was a faith-based group for graduate students? LOLI've already bought the expansion pack and we're looking forward to playing again at our next monthly potluck. I might filter out a few of the action cards to help balance the deck with the Food Fight issue, but that's my only potential ""negative"" from the entire game.",5.0

I‚Äôm not gonna lie IÔ∏è did No have high expectations for this to be a game for adult but IÔ∏è was Sooooo wrong!!!!!!

Lol. Loads of fun I recommend it.",5.0
2661,B07JZTBV9C,R1FM7J4R7NOBDH,Poorly written rules,"  First of all, the game is cute. Good ideas from a creative kid, I'm happy to say that. However, it's not the kid's job to make sure that this game works as a game. This game's rules are so poorly written that we have to create our own rules just to play it. A good rulebook would address all possibilities and this one barely addresses any.First of all, the Food Fight card is incredibly confusing. Players compete in a fast-paced showdown and draw cards until they draw points cards, then compete to see who gets the highest point value card. But it's the details that matter. What happens when you draw an action card? According to the game rules, you can choose to play the action card immediately. But what about the point values? Do we keep drawing? Do we stop after drawing an action card? What happens if the action card is dependent on other things? What happens if we never draw a point value card? One time I got 12 action cards in a row and that literally wiped the whole deck. Is a Food Fight card supposed to basically end the game?And there's the fact that the entire purpose of the game, Taco vs Burrito, is completely pointless. There is no game mechanic that actually cares about whether you choose Taco or Burrito. It's aesthetic only. Why is the name of the game literally an aesthetic feature?To make it worse, there are even contradicting rules. The quick rules cards say that you can only put cards into your own burrito. But the full rulebook says you can put cards into OTHER peoples' burritos as well. Which one is it???? Makes a pretty big difference.This game is good if you're playing with children who don't understand board games much, and just want some dumb silly gross food fun. But if you're literally ANYBODY except a child, avoid this game until they clean up their rulebook.",2.0

2663,B07JZTBV9C,R1N3WIC4LVN8WO,As much fun for adults as kids!,"  My granddaughters aged 5 and 8 love this game! The best thing about it is the adults have as much fun as the kids. The ""No Bueno"" cards are similar to the ""Nope"" cards in Exploding Kittens but the other action cards are original and perhaps even more fun. It is super-quick to learn and kids don't really have to read to play; it only takes them one round to know what all the cards do. My 5 year old beat the pants off us and we were hysterical with all the twists and turns. My only complaint is that I wish more could play, especially as $19.95 is a lot for a card game. When you have a game all ages can play, you need 6-8 people to be able to join in. We'll simply buy a second. Hopefully it goes on lightening deal again soon.",5.0
2664,B07JZTBV9C,R30Z6K27V5PHEA,Fun but the game is not fully fleshed out,"  The game is fun, my complaint (sort of) is their are basically no rules.  Basic gameplay instructions but no fleshed out details.  My family and I had to make up our own ""house rules"" for almost everything.  Actually, that was in some ways fun and creative for us to do, but what will happen if we ever play with anyone else who has the game?  We will have to negotiate and argue over each others rules (not fun).  I'll give an example: A player plays a minus card and the other plays a no bueno card.  What happens?  The game does not inform you.  Is it just a block and we can both keep our cards? we decided no.  Does it mean the player who blocks loses their no bueno card? Does the player who tried to play the minus just return it to their hand? do they still get to play something else? Or, does the attempted play count as their turn? Still what about the minus card? Is it considered played and discarded in the discard pile? Same question for the no bueno block card.  We decided that both cards are considered played and placed in the discard pile and the attempted play of the minus card counts as the players turn.  My point in writing this, is you will have to decided about things like this for quiet a bit until you figure out for yourselves all the different scenarios and card plays.  Really, all these things should be written out in a real rule book.I'll add one last thing, we find the game is fun played in a pre-determined number of rounds with the dealing passing around from player to player to keep it balanced.  You add up the scores of each round to determine a winner.  Adds a nice additional strategy level to each round game play.Still fun game.  Interesting strategy game.",4.0
2665,B07JZTBV9C,R23FECBNWEY8MZ,Doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype,"  This game is exactly as much fun as you would expect a game designed by a seven year old to be.  It has some novelty value, as the cards have silly names, but even for other seven year olds it‚Äôs not very fun.  There are very few tactics, the lead shifts around according to chance, and a lot of the moves are zero-sum.  I can‚Äôt believe I paid $20 for this; we played it once and doubt we will bother again.  Save your money!",2.0

2667,B07JZTBV9C,R1YQMHVIQKVOEG,Needs improvement,"  I played this with my children, ages 8-12. They like and are good at card games so I gifted one of them this game.Cons: Instructions not clear as instructions on sheet and quick instructions on cards differ with amount of information. Too much confusion on what to do with cards in hand when game ends.No clear directions how to ‚Äútally‚Äù cards at end of game. Example, if you take ‚Äú+cards‚Äù and the subtract ‚Äú-card‚Äù then multiply ‚ÄúX2‚Äù card you will get different result then if you take ‚Äú+card‚Äù then x2 then -cards. In one game it make a difference of one winner or two people tie.No instruction on game ending in tie.My kids didn‚Äôt really want to play again. Suggestion: Skip this card game and get Exploding Kittens",2.0

2670,B07JZTBV9C,R5N5A4JVIUG2M,Some strategy but probably more fun with a younger group.,"  This is another game we tried today. Created by a 7 year old. It has some strategy but not nearly as fun as deck 10 for our family. Better for younger kids like 4/5-10ish maybe. They will like the silly food combinations. And it‚Äôs a fast game because it‚Äôs a small deck. And parents who play with them will like the bit of strategy in it. My youngest is 13. I don‚Äôt feel it was worth $20. I‚Äôd say more $10. But still a clever game. It would make a great gift.  The directions could be a little more clear on things like do you look at cards before you steal, and that your original 5 cards start in your hand not your taco. But it worked out as we played.",3.0

I can group 4 students who do not get along for a game of Taco Vs. Burrito and they will be giggling together within minutes.

2673,B07JZTBV9C,ROSDK7CHEBNWX,Not that fun,"  I was hoping for a fun, easy to learn game.  There isn't much to this game and it gets boring quickly.  There is a ""Health Inspector"" card which is basically a ""you lose"" card and the 2 games my family played was won by the 1 person who did not get the Health Inspector card.  Spend your money on somethng else.  The Sushi Go game is a little more complicated but more fun.",2.0
2674,B07JZTBV9C,R1SZ3U8J4W8HB0,Fun for all ages,"  In this house we have a 10 year old, 26 year old, and two 50 year old members.  We all enjoy this game.  It reminds me a little of UNO, but the object before you go out of cards is to fill your taco/burrito with point cards.  We had to watch a youtube video on how to play, because the written instructions were slightly confusing on how the game ended.  The first time we played we turned over the discard pile and kept going, but as far as we can tell that is incorrect.  Once the draw pile is gone, the play continues until someone is out of cards from their hand.  Most points collected wins.  Lots of fun with cards that let you rob from other players, the discard pile, and change hands at the last minute with someone who was winning.  Hope this helps.",5.0

We finally opened the game tonight and spent about 2 hours playing this game (which if you have a 6/7 year old you know it‚Äôs a LONG time). It‚Äôs not a long game, that‚Äôs just how long we played before it was bedtime. We had to take a break and he ran for a notepad and left me this note. Great game.",5.0

The instructions are a tad confusing, but we figured it out. Received it in the mail today, and after playing, we ordered the expansion pack.

I got this for my youngest daughter (10) for Christmas but we never ended up playing it before our older daughters went back to college. It's set up like apples to apples so you should have at least 4 to play. This weekend one of our girls came home for spring break and we took advantage of having 4 people at home and I'm really glad we did. We laughed for hours and played 6 games in a row, which is a miracle for us. We have all girls and they loved this but I can see how this would be an even bigger hit with boys. Lots of bodily functions mentioned on the answer cards with plenty of hilarious questions to take full advantage. The only thing I would say is that your family has to have some appreciation for bathroom humor or you won't enjoy this game. Its not a game you bring out and play with other people unless you know them well.",5.0
2688,B01M3UZGD9,R2Q6X51Q4YTUZ5,Okay for ages 6-10 yo,"  I bought this as a gift for my sister, BIL and their four kids for Christmas. I wanted something fun and easy to play with a large family on game night. My nieces and nephews are 10, 12, 14, & 16 yo. While the youngest seemed to like it, the older ones got bored with its attempts of gross humor quickly. While it aims at being appropriately inappropriate, it just seems cheesy. - like the cards try too hard. I wish I would have picked something else.Most appropriately inappropriate for kids age 6-10yo who still find this potty humor funny.",3.0
2689,B01M3UZGD9,R38BLOMQ3WA1Q9,Laugh So Hard You Cry,"  Got this to play with the family over Thanksgiving because I have enjoyed playing Cards Against Humanity with adults before. The group consisted of two adults (one early 30's, one late 30's) and two kids (boy 11, girl 9). It was clear to see the difference in humor between the adults and kids, but that did not stop any of us from laughing our heads off. We must have played for a few hours, honestly I am not sure because we just kept going and going, laughing more and more. There were small giggles, loud laughs, unstoppable laughs, and literally tear induced laughs. This is a definite keeper for our family gatherings. Can't wait to play it again!",5.0

If Apples to Apples is too tame and Cards Against Humanity is too much for your family this is a great middle ground. As with CAH, you may want to review the cards prior to play to determine whether you think they are appropriate for your family and friends considering your personal opinions, age of players, etc. Simple game to pickup (especially if you've played either of the others mentioned). Can be played rather quickly or for quite some time if you want to make a night of it and not get bored. No expansion packs that I've seen but I'm sure if you wanted to you could mix in cards from other games or even make your own. Lots of fun!",4.0

She described it as Cards Against Humanity for kids, which I also saw in the reviews, so probably a good description.",5.0
2697,B01M3UZGD9,RW55M98YLWVRD,Disgustingly Fun,"  Yes, this is a rip-off of cards against humanity, but one that works for and appeals to kids.

I wanted a game to play with the entire family during thanksgiving. I was looking for something somewhat clean, and silly, but not too silly that the adults would hate it. EVERYONE loved it!  By the end of the night, my 8 yr old nephew loved it so much he was begging his parents to buy one for him.  And the next day, my 4.5 year old son was asking to play it again at breakfast.  It‚Äôs definitely a keeper and I highly recommend it to anyone with kids. The big cheese dance is genius.

2700,B01M3UZGD9,RDFGCX9Z83LY1,Great for young kids,"  My 7 year old loves this game. She does need help playing it, since her reading isn‚Äôt on the same level as some of the cards. It gets lots of laughs and is very PG. The potty humor answers always get the biggest giggles. If you are an adult this game isn‚Äôt as hilarious or entertaining as Cards Against Humanity but this game is a good clean version.

A lot of the answer cards don‚Äôt match well with the fill in the blanks. You have to alter the answer for it to make sense. There are blank cards for writing your own answer, which I guess helps with this situations but you don‚Äôt always have a blank card in your hand.

Head to head battle cards are a heated competition in our house. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that you go through the 200 movie cards pretty fast.

2807,B07FDYS8ZV,R27H5PPB6W7B8S,very expensive for what it offers !!,"  I think it is Much over priced for what it containsFirst : very small box , with (folded and crumpled low quality map) from paper which even cannot be flat on ground by itself , we need some objects on the corners , the map has just numbers on it , no names or any geographical beneficial information , so it is a waste by itself , imagine a geographical game with bad MAP ?!!Second : most of the facts are useless and non important , what the benefit to you to know how many neighbor countries with Bhutan ? why you will Know how many meters is the highest point in Marshall islands ?!! why any one will learn such nonsense ?!!these are non beneficial facts , instead of giving informations about economy or touristic attractions , or famous people  or main language spoken or any thing useful , they give you ( highest point elevations , area ...?!!) just solid dumb facts that you can find better in google and never needs to memorize them or know them at allthe game itself contains some good points and some silly pointsthe main good thing about it , that it contains almost all countries !! and that's itSo if you want  flashcards about the world countries ( flag , capital , area ‚Ä¶.etc ) , then here we go , you have it for such high price !!",1.0
2808,B07FDYS8ZV,R27S4OFTW75IFE,Everyone wins from what they learn.,"  For first game with an 8 and 11 year old, I took out only the 22 North America cards.  We played with 7 cards each.Before starting, I did a quick overview - how many continents are there?  Can you name them (Oceania was less well known than Australia as continent name) ?  How many countries (wow - LOTS)?  Then looked at the 4 facts on each card, pointing out what M (million) and K (thousand) meant.  Looked over the map.  They were ready for the entire set by the end of the first small game.  We briefly looked at a map of the world that showed the names of all the countries.  Biggest take away for 8 year old - how really tiny countries can have enormous populations.  If I move to using the challenge facts, I'll start small again - beginning with North America.Their mother told me that night they couldn't stop talking about the game.  Everyone wins from what they learn.",5.0
2809,B07FDYS8ZV,R4MAGY61RXX0R,"Good, fun learning tool -- just add your own tweaks!","  Our family recently purchased The World Game. This review reflects us (three adults) having played it several times.We'd say it's fun in a learning-is-fun kind of way. The cards are well made, and included with the set is a map of the world of good, sturdy paper.One of the nice things about the game is that you can modify play in a variety of ways. The rules as provided, while fine, need not limit how you want to approach learning about other countries. For instance, we initially began playing with a mix of cards representing countries from all over the globe...pretty challenging unless you're already good at geography, which we are not (yet)!So instead, we'll work on countries one continent at a time.But that's just one example of how you can do your own thing.Also, we've noticed that the game's creator listens to suggestions from players. He fulfilled the wish of one online commenter by sending a pdf of countries in alphabetical order with their corresponding numerical designation on the game's map. We got that list when we purchased the game. And actually, we made our own list too, arranging the countries in numerical order so we can immediately find the name of any country on the map. Another addition we intend to make on our spreadsheet is primary languages spoken (data we will obtain through our own research).So, obviously, there are lots of ways you can expand on The World Game if you like. It is a cool little learning tool.",5.0
2810,B07FDYS8ZV,R1BEAKSD4V002E,The geography flashcard set I was looking for,"  First, the product is solid. Great design, well-crafted, and sturdy. The cards themselves are durable and high quality, and the foldable map insert is designed well.Second, the game itself is fun and made such that you can play a 5 minute game or for hours. I've played it with my 9-year old nephew and my parents. You can make it as competitive as you want.But as a geography trivia nut, you don't need anyone else to play the game to enjoy it. The flash cards are just fun to flip through and quiz yourself. It's a great learning device and fits the bill as exactly what I was looking for.",5.0
2811,B07FDYS8ZV,R1N0P3DFSUUS0P,Fun learning tool,"  I‚Äôm a huge geography nerd and wanted to try this game out to see if it could challenge me, and I absolutely loved it! It‚Äôs a great study and learning tool if you really want to refine your geography skill. The game itself is quite fun and I loved that you could play with pretty much anyone regardless of how good they were at geography with the use of game styles that can be altered per person, for example my gf is not good at geography so I would only ask her what continent the country was at, inversely I‚Äôm good at countries but am not so good at capital cities. Like this we had a very fair game where I was beat. Liked it a lot and would recommend it especially as a learning tool for geography teachers and professors. I would also say that they should have an expansion pack for physical geography and such, which would make the game even more challenging!",5.0
2812,B07FDYS8ZV,R1TNPYQKI8TMUN,Helpful supplement and fun for kids,"  I bought this game to supplement my middle schooler's understanding of geography and the larger world. She loves the Top Trumps card games so this was an easy sell even though it's ""educational"" and not just for fun. There are different ways to use the cards to help give your child a better sense of the world and geography. I've found the game to be a great jumping off point for conversations. She asks to play it so that's a good sign! I gave it four stars instead of five because it'd be nice if there was a bit more information about the nations on the cards. There were also a couple of errors with the numbering and the nation's they match up to on the world map.",4.0
2813,B07FDYS8ZV,R18N73FIQ19PYT,What a great way to learn about the world,"  I bought this game for my 8 year old grandson.  He loves it!  I had to buy another copy for myself so that I can study and be able to play with him (and perhaps reawaken a few old brain cells).  We visited Temple Square in Salt Lake City, UT, where the young missionaries serving as guides all have a flag on their name tags showing where they are from.  My grandson was able to recognize all the flags...even Siberia!...and amazed us all.  Upon returning home I ordered a second set for myself.",5.0
2814,B07FDYS8ZV,REUHAU3XW1GSC,Fun and informative,  Our family has found this to be a very informative game. I like the quality of the cards and map that comes with it. I recommend splitting up the continents first with younger children to not overwhelm them.,5.0
2815,B07FDYS8ZV,RM3SCP9NW01F,Fun Learning Geography,"  My 9 year old is hooked on geography. He loves these cards and its games. Cards of good quality. There are at least several ways to use these cards one of which is plain old flash card method. Each card shows flag of country, country name, capital city and country facts. Card info corresponds to a map included with purhcase. The games offered vary from a sort of ""war card game"" where a player chooses a fact they think will trump other player's cards to idenitifying country by flag, continent, etc.We paid 25 bucks, which is a bit steep in my book, but everything seems to be getting more expensive these days. As mentioned, product is of good quality and its hard to put a price tag on stirring a child's fascination to learn. In this respect, priceless.Highly recommend",5.0
2816,B07FDYS8ZV,R2NV48K93MQOPY,Fun and Educational,  If you want to introduce a level of entertainment to your household while actually learning something then I recommend this.

2817,B07FDYS8ZV,R3473UWFK6BFNR,Decent game for teaching basic geography to kids,"  Simple game with cards representing all the world's countries. Definitely don't need to know tons about geography as you will learn as you go.

Not sure it will hold most adults' attention for long.",3.0
2818,B07FDYS8ZV,RETDLOWS8PM8X,Disappointed,"  Not enough built in aspects to make this game truly a learning experience. You can easily play a whole game without ever looking at the map.

2819,B07FDYS8ZV,R1PYT3PP4HLDUF,Perfect game for all ages,"  This is one of the best educational board game!  I have bought it to my 11 years old son, to extend his geography knowledge and sense of the world. It really helps him to orientate on the map and have better understanding of countries location.It also gives knowledge about population of every country and flags. After playing a couple of times he can name the good number of countries by their flags.It is very good for adults too - you will refresh your internal geography  database and even learn something new.Pros:Very good polygraphic quality of every piece - cards, map, box.  The box is very solid - you won't break it even if you step on it. Every picture is very colorful and bright. Cards are thick and also look sturdy.The game itself is very interesting and enjoying. You gonna learn a lot playing any variant of the game.194 cards with flags, capitals, population, highest point and number of neighboring countries.Detailed, well marked colorful map for easier navigation.Cons:Nothing come up to my mind",5.0
2820,B07FDYS8ZV,R2SGQP7HFAAXMH,Great learning game for any age!,"  This game is Awesome!  Basic game is like the game 'war' played with real cards, but the information on the cards makes it a challenge and takes strategy to learn the countries in play and how they relate to each other.  My daughter (10th grade) and I are in a race to see who can memorize the capitals and flags faster (194 of each).  I think she would have enjoyed this at any age because there is enough chance in who gets what cards so no ones' feelings are hurt, but enough strategy that there are possibilities for increasing the odds of winning.",5.0
2821,B07FDYS8ZV,RZR3QM8Y8YY3T,"learn country names, location, flag","  This is not a game we bought for kids. My spouse and I bought it to complement our collection of other board and card games, for something different for us to do sometimes.  If you want an occasional 5 - 10 minute distraction and learn or be reminded of country names, location, and flag then this could be fun for you too.  When we see a country in the cards we hadn't thought of much before then sometimes we follow up and look up on wikipedia to see what other generally interesting things we could learn about the country.",4.0
2822,B07FDYS8ZV,R32ADDOQBYP2ZC,World card game is very versatile,"  We played the world card game with kids and found it very easy to adapt it to  8 and 11 year old children.

2823,B07FDYS8ZV,RJ6RM59WXG1VC,Overpriced deck of playing cards,"  It‚Äôs basically a small deck of cards with (4) facts like area, population, highest point and the total amount of neighboring countries.  It doesn‚Äôt even list the neighboring countries.  The cards do show a flag and the capital.  I wish I realized it was a deck of cards and not a ‚Äúboard game‚Äù as advertised in the title.  For the cost, I would have expected more of a Trivial Pursuit type board game and not a deck of playing cards for the most part.  It‚Äôs certainly not worth $30.  I honestly wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $10 for the cards.",2.0
2824,B07FDYS8ZV,R216CXJD2APYPV,Nice item!,"  Haven‚Äôt really played it as a game per say,  but my son LOVES these cards! Somehow I received 2 of these (and was charged for both-which was Very expensive!)- but I returned one and they sent me a refund w/o problems. It was worth the hassle to see my son learning so much about the different countries. There is quite a bit of extra info on the cards-( not just flags!).",5.0
2825,B07FDYS8ZV,RR8PKBFQH7YED,Fun for all!,"  I bought this game because I really like geography and I saw that this was a fun way of practicing and learning facts about all the countries in the world. The cards are very informative; stating facts about every country. In addiction, they include a map where are the countries are clearly labeled which could form part of the game if you decide so. I‚Äôve played this game with my friends and every time I keep learning more and more about flags, capitals, and locations of all the countries all around the world. If you want to start to learning about the countries in the world, or just like geography in general, this is one of the few games that make geography really fun. I highly recommend it!",5.0
2826,B07FDYS8ZV,R2WI88U0B3DBFG,Great game for learning,"  A great game for geography enthusiasts, or to help kids develop and interest in geography. My son loves this game, but when his cousins play it with him we modify it slightly so that he doesn't just give them the flag challenge all of the time (because that would give him the advantage). It increased his cousin's interest in geography and they had a great time playing the game. When I play, I learn something each time. You really can't help but learn! I love this game and am glad we purchased it.",5.0
2827,B07FDYS8ZV,R2IL6KLCH74LI3,Needs just a little work,"  Not the sellers fault at all, my only complaint would be that there are no multiple choice questions for those not completely familiar with world geography.

All in all a great game but could use this one improvement",4.0

2830,B07FDYS8ZV,R3I7DXB0IKII42,"Good game, my kids have learned a lot","  This is a good game but it has a few major flaws. There are some countries that can never win the challenges because they are smaller, have small populations, and low elevation. I think this game would be better if it also came with a dice that had high/low/ least/greatest or something to even the playing field for the smaller countries.",4.0

I carry the cards around with me and study them when I have a moment or two. So much of my geography memory has gone missing and I need to recapture it.I bought a set for my father too.

2899,0975277324,R15BHD0DM0LRHX,Hours of fun!  Recommended!,"  I bought this game to introduce my parents and younger nephews to Board games and to summarize the experience, it was a huge success!Ticket to ride is a light strategy game where the aim is to connect routes with the chain of trains you have and get points.  The person with the highest number of points wins!  It is a nice game for kids and elders alike.  As this is a beginner strategy game, I would not recommend this game for seasoned strategists, but rather for folks who are just getting into strategy gamesBuild: 9 on 10The build of the game was really good.  The quality of trains was sturdy and the look and feel of the board was professional.  I did not need a sleeve for the cards as they did not bend and were nice and flat.  They also have a nice touch and feel.  While one of my trains was damaged,  they had provided plenty of spare trains which made it worthwhile.Packaging: 10 on10The package was received on time.  The product itself comes in nice professional box and has dedicated locations to store each item from the game.  It was quite easy to unwrap the product and start using it.Overall: 9 on 10Overall, having played many many strategy games, this still ends up as one of my favorite ‚Äòlight‚Äô strategy games.I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item. I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I can‚Äôt hold or touch the products before buying them. So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item I‚Äôm thinking about purchasing. I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others ‚Äì to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). If you have found this review helpful, I‚Äôd love if you‚Äôd indicate that below.",5.0
2900,0975277324,RPOA22ZRNCUGC,choo choo get on board but also one quick thing about the actual board,"  So here's the deal this game is super fun just like everybody says so don't think my less than 5 star review indicates anything but that.  We play it as a family and both the parents and the kids get really into it. High play and replay-ability, quick to learn but a LIFETIME TO MASTER and all that stuff like you'd expect based on everyone raving about it.Observations / suggestions / etc: - Requires a fairly big surface area given lots of cards and lots of pieces are part of this game - Gameplay is super fast, you can get around the horn very quickly (4 players can play in 30 seconds total if they all just draw cards), so don't think you're going to be getting up to get a drink after your turn or anything.  Or checking phones seriously just put them away.  Good to agree on a set ""break time"" or something - Total game time is also pretty fast but not silly fast.  An hour or 90 minutes or so. - If you play with people who are sneaky you should think about wearing sunglasses so they can't see where you are looking on the board because it might give away your strategy if they could tell where you are focusing - If you're playing against people who don't wear sunglasses try and watch their eyes so you can see where they are looking, it may give away their strategy and you can swoop in and take their routes and win the game that'll teach them - The spot labeled Duluth is clearly in Minneapolis/St Paul and *everyone* who you play with from Minnesota will point it out - I recommend some sort of ""card holder"" thing if you play with younger kids and/or people with smaller hands.  We have some wooden boards with slots cut in them to hold cards and they help a ton in this game (and others). I put a picture of that up.My only real critique of this game - and the reason it's 4 not 5 stars - is the board doesn't sit especially flat.  You can see in the pictures I attached.  At times you have what seems like a million little trains on the board and just having the board not sit flat makes it seem a bit cheap. This is all about MANUFACTURING quality however, not about GAMEPLAY quality.",4.0

2902,0975277324,R7KDRSFUM0V9K,Disappointment / Buy a different version than this one,"  I love the game Ticket to Ride. I own the 10th-anniversary edition and the Boats and Trains edition. This 15th-anniversary edition is not nearly the quality. The only thing that denotes this as special is the sleeve that slides over the box. They have down-sized the game. The board is smaller which is ok. But, they have made all the cards Mini-Sized. They are too hard to shuffle and hold. It would have been ok to have the ticket smaller but not the playing cards. The New Millenium Monopoly had better translucent pieces than these trains.In the 10th-anniversary edition, each train is a different kind of train car. This one they are all the same train just different colors. I do not like this version.My suggestion, if you are wanting to buy this game, get an older version.",1.0
2903,0975277324,RVCTP5HO851S3,It is a favorite game now in our family,"  Having played this game multiple times with all ages 8-65 years old, we have made a few modifications. At the beginning of the game, we deal out six train cards instead of four. We also can draw cards and play trains in a single turn. I agree with other reviews that 2-4 is the ideal number. It is a favorite game now in our family. Last January on a no school day, we had three games going and then a championship game and a consolation game. The kids, aged 8-12, only played one game but enjoyed playing and were competitive players. The championship game was game on and very competitive!",5.0
2904,0975277324,R1DK4S8CPBXQ6C,Favorite family game!,"  We LOVE this game! At first the instructions seemed a little daunting to us, but after a quick google search we stumbled upon an extremely helpful video done by the actor, Wil Wheaton. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHmf1bau9xQ  Once we learned how to play, we were able to quickly and simply explain the rules to our 9 year old daughter in minutes. We originally bought the game for her. But to be honest, my husband and I have enjoyed playing it so much that I think we've played it 4x as much as she has. It's a very basic strategy game - Your goal is to have the most points at the end of the game. You gain points by claiming routes and completing destination tickets. We've tried playing the game with a couple of different strategies and no two games are ever really the same. It's a fantastic family game for up to 5 players, great for children and/or adults. Highly recommend it to be added to anyone's game collection.",5.0
2905,0975277324,RXVVTF7OYPG2U,Ticket to Ride- It has quickly become my go-to game for family game nights,"  I'm in my 30's and have been looking for games to play while visiting my parents or with my roommate and his kids, and ""Ticket to Ride"" has quickly become a favorite.  I first heard about it online about a year and half back, on a gaming show hosted by Wil Wheaton, and immediately ordered a copy.  It's a game that's simple enough that a child can grasp it, (I'd say 10 years old would be a good starting age, though it is advertised as being for ages 8+)  but also complex enough to be entertaining for teens and adults.It's essentially a card collection game, as you try to draw matching colors in order to trade them in and build trains between cities on a map of the US.  (With each line needing a specific color and number of cards.)  In addition, each player must also complete specific routes or ""tickets"" between key cities (often at different ends of the map), and can also work on other tasks like trying to build the longest singular train path, which gives you and end-game score-boost.As I said, it's very simple to grasp.  But there's quite a bit of complexity, as most of the tasks can be completed multiple ways, and players can actively try to block one-another's routes and strategies by getting to certain areas first.  With dozens of locations on the map and numerous ""tickets"" to play, it makes each new playthrough fun and unique.  There's near-endless replay value, and with various expansions and ""sequels"" having been released, there's even more potential for players who master this original edition.Playtime usually lasts between 40-80 minutes, depending on the number of players and their experience, and it's very quickly paced once everyone gets their hands on the cards they need.The materials include a rather large gameboard (make sure you have a sizable table to play on, as it's roughly twice the size of most standard tabletop game-boards), wooden score-keeping pieces, over 100 cards and plastic trains in about a half-dozen colors.  If I were to nitpick, I would definitely say the cards are oddly small and thus can be hard to shuffle and handle- especially at the start of each game, when you'll end up spending 15 minutes just trying to mix them up as much as possible.  But it's a small price to pay for such a fun game.Overall, Ticket to Ride has quickly become a family favorite, and it is definitely one I'd highly recommend!  A 5 out of 5!",5.0
2906,0975277324,R20KUJ8J6WKCDD,5 out of 5 of my clan agree!,"  It's rare to find a game that everyone in the family loves.  This is that game.With most games, we get one of 3 scenarios in my household.  1) my boys like it.  They're a little older and we play a lot of strategy games.  My daughter (who is the youngest) doesn't win these often and either tires of them quickly or doesn't like them at all.  2) My daughter likes it.  These tend to be games steered more towards chance where strategy is not so important.  The boys generally only tolerate these because I make them play (gotta keep it fair, you know)  Or 3) a few games are somewhere in the middle that none of us loves but none of us hates either.  The compromise game.But with Ticket to Ride, we have a real winner.  There's enough strategy in it that you can make or break your game on your own merits, but there's also enough element of chance in it (and the strategy isn't typically too deep) that younger kids will enjoy it too (as long as they're old enough to grasp the game mechanics in the first place).  Light-hearted, fairly fast-paced, and - excuse the cliche but seriously - fun for the whole family!",5.0

Our mistake was to play the first time with 5 people. It took forever with that many people and figuring out how to play. It is not a difficult game but you do have to learn how to play it.

Our game seemed to be of good quality and had all its pieces. It was much bigger than I had anticipated and we had to play at the kitchen table rather than our usual card table. It took me several times to read the directions and figure out how to play to teach my daughter but we did manage to get a game going finally and learn how it all worked. About halfway through the game she looked at me and said, ""Can I go do something else now?"" At first I was a little hurt that she'd want to leave halfway through a game with me, but then I realized I was thinking the same thing. It just wasn't fun to us. We've decided to re-home the game and stick to chess and monopoly.",3.0
2915,0975277324,R1NCZ2D1WHB56N,Good family game,"  Ticket to Ride is one of those games that I've always heard about but never actually tried, so I bought it for me and my 9 year old to play. We loved the Alexa set up and guided play. The only problem is that at one point Alexa says something like ""If you need help just say Alexa.."" but her own voice triggered her and we got stuck in a loop for a few minutes. (When she says her name, just yell TICKETS or something loudly enough that it doesn't directly trigger her listening). The background train noises were pretty cool, and it was nice to not have to worry about keeping track of points. Now I wish other games also had a vocal app tie -in.The game itself was easy enough that we got right into playing (although the first time Alexa does guide you thru the rules) and I think when my husband plays with us we'll be able to just explain it to him fairly quickly. The two player variant left a lot of room for routes but you can definitely see that 3 or more players will have you thinking a little more strategically about how to chose your routes. We were able to play this game together and have a conversation, so even though the game is pretty much what you see it has pretty good replayable value since we can do it while we discuss things or talk about our day, etc.",5.0
2916,0975277324,RL9HYHLS3MSU1,Great game!,"  We LOVE this game so much that we have purchased other versions (though they're not as good as the original IMO). It's good for a variety of age groups. There is a bit of strategy involved and it's competitive without being cutthroat.Basically you draw route cards and you complete as many as you can using the little trains (using colored train cards to complete the necessary length of track) until someone gets low on train pieces. Longer routes are worth more points and if you're lucky your routes will overlap. Your pawn moves around the perimeter of the board as you lay down trains on the tracks according to the size of track and add in all your completed route points at the end of the game (or deduct for incomplete routes). Whoever is further on the count is the winner. I'd say it takes about a half hour per game.CONSThe pieces are a bit small so if you're arthritic or VERY young, you may find it challenging. My mom has a hard time reading the city names. I would LOVE to see a deluxe version with indents in the board for the pieces to stay where you put them (Heaven forbid you bump the board), and flags for the cities so they can be read easily from all sides of the table.",4.0

He is hard to shop for but he likes trains and both my parents likes games.  We played it this afternoon.  Some other reviewers describe getting poor quality counterfeits, but the copy I received is either real, or a very good fake, since it had all the pieces and seems solid.  It Is a fun game but I already knew that.  I hope my parents will play it again.I am already thinking up house rules to simplify it for my mom, who is an avid game player and really wants to play, but is suffering some memory loss issues.1.  I am going to suggest we let each player both pick cards AND play routes, each turn.  Having to do one or the other is a strategy element in the game, but my mom found it unintuive we had to explain it again every time it was her turn.  Memory loss has made her impatient, so she was always placing routes when a better strategist would have waited for more cards.  She's not going to learn to wait, so having everyone pick their cards and also play a route if possible, each turn, will make it fairer to her.2.  And I am going to suggest we let players pick up two cards each time regardless if they are wildcards.  This will lean it a little more to luck instead of skill because they'll get snatched up as soon as they come up, but at least we can stop reminding her that she can't have two cards if she takes the wildcard.Both of these will also move the game along more quickly, which also will make her happier.",5.0

My sister visits us every summer and normally we play cards, cribbage or euchre or something, with an occasional board game or two. This year, we mostly played this game. It is good if you are playing with 2 players or all 5 players. It can be fun to make up some of your own house rules too and change it up a bit. Every game is different but with the same goal. The games don't go on forever like in a game like Monopoly. Most games last between 1/2 to an hour. Usually we ended up playing about 2-4 times before we were done for the day. After she got home, she bought the European model for at home and when I visit. I think this is a MUST HAVE game in everyone's collection, moreso than the classics out there. I love playing this game and it is good for families. I would say kids down to about 5 or so would be able to grasp this game fine but some on the younger end might be a little bit frustrated or slow at some of the things that need to be done during the game. I also think it is funny that Duluth shows up on the map where Minneapolis and other locations similar. Just some liberties needed for pieces to fit right.

Classic table top that kinda hooks anyone that plays it. Simple and fun while involving strategy for personal agenda.

2922,0975277324,R3T9QI0CDXE119,Great game - mediocre manufacturing,"  The game itself is great - pretty easy to learn but hard to master. There is a lot of room for developing a strategy and gaining on your family. :) A full 5 stars for the concept and rules of the game, etc. However, as many others have noted, the quality of the board, cards and train cars leaves something to be desired. For around $45, this is a fairly pricey board game but it feels like a lot of corners were cut in the design. The board does not lay flat unless you leave it out overnight with some heavy books on it before you play the next day. The cards are much too small and therefore hard to shuffle and stack. They should be normal playing card size. The train car pieces are small and lightweight and easily get knocked around the board by mistake. I'd love to see a board with some texturing that could prevent this. I'd still buy the game again because we have a lot of fun with it. My husband enjoys it as much as my 7yo. However, I probably wouldn't give it to another family because I feel like the physical game causes a lot of unnecessary frustration.

I gave 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons:1 - There is only 5 players maximum. The board could accomodate 1 more player. I know that does not seem like a big difference, but in the play and flow of the game, having 1 more player could make this game even tighter and more competetive, forcing players to have more strategy in picking their routes.2 - The instructons for this game are very long and repetetive, and even somewhat confusing. It all makes sense after you get through a few rounds of turns, but at first the instructions leave players looking for a simpler bullet list of ""how to"".Other than this, the game is near perfection.",4.0

It is very simple for new players to learn yet allows for advanced play and strategy for veteran players.  Every game is different due to the randomization of the tickets.  My 10 year old loves playing it with me.  I've taken the game to family gatherings and it is an easy to get everyone to play because it is so easy for new players to pick up yet has plenty to offer for experienced players.I was concerned ordering online and having the game delivered due to complaints of damaged boxes and the like.  I'm very protective of my stuff and want to keep it in mint condition.  My game arrived if flawless condition.  It shipped in an over-sized box with ample packaging materials.While I think the game is great there are a few minor things that prevent me from giving it 5 stars.The board doesn't lay completely flat.  It appears as if the board seams are too tight preventing it from laying flat.  I'm hoping over time it will flatten out more.I may be spoiled from playing my friends 10th Anniversary Edition of Ticket To Ride but the color and ticket cards are just too small.  They are hard to hold onto and even harder to shuffle.  The 10 Anniversary Edition has full-sized playing cards which are much easier to handle.  The card storage in the box also doesn't make sense to me.  The way the plastic box insert is molded all of the colored cards can't be stacked together.  You must separate part of them and put them into the same stack with the ticket cards.  This seems like a minor thing but it would have been so simple for them to fix it by making one of the stack spots a bit deeper in the plastic insert.,4.0

Figure it a cross between chess and monopoly.The idea is to connect railroad lines to get from one point to another. The possibilities are almost infinite, but the cards to earn certain lines are not.... frustrating.We played several games, it took the better part of a day to do so... There are a lot of details to track, things to accomplish, others to block (chess) and lots of cards and resources to track (monopoly). It requires lots of people to play. I doubt it would be fun with only two people (monopoly).I would recommend the game as a gift.

2935,B075YGB112,R3MJPJ0RJQTBX5,Excuuuse Me! This is still a good season!!!!,"  I don't understand why the person above me thinks this is the season where it goes downhill.  Did people notice that Friends was not so funny after its 6th season?  And that in its 10th season, it was really just scraping the bottom of the barrel?  W&G, in its 7th season, may have lost some of its ""HO-MOJO"", but altogether, still pulled off some great writing.The show peaks from seasons 1 to 6, but bounces back with an even stronger 8th season, which, I am hoping gets released soon.I have never watched a television show more times.  The cast is unbelievably talented and they all seem to have grown more naturally and maturely towards portraying their characters as the show progressed.  None of them ever ""acted"".It is arguable that most of the time, Jack and Karen were the ones that were funniest, but without the balance and sanity that Will & Grace  provided, the whole thing would have been a vain and ludicrous showcase of a flamboyantly gay satire.As a gay man, I find this show doubly appealing.  Not only is it hugely entertaining, but it also conveys several positive messages: that Homosexuals a)can be successful and productive members of society; b)are just like everybody else in that they value friendships and relationships; c)are people too and that they should NOT BE TOLERATED but EMBRACED; d)are truly members of the superior race because they enjoy the best of both worlds, are hilarious and great to live with, and, have impeccable taste!!!Finally, one of the most touching scenes (season 8/A Little Christmas Queer) was when Will asked his mother why she cheered on her 9 yr. old gay nephew's christmas show while she ruined every one of his productions when he was a child by being so uncomfortable and unsupportive.  She replied, ""because back then, I didn't know the kind of person you would turn out to be.""Will & Grace will always be remembered as a show that mattered and broke ground because not only did it make us laugh and cry with delight, but it also made us think about how we are all wonderfully unique, and how, at the same time, we are also still one and the same: HUMAN.",4.0

2987,B00D4NJSBW,R137CXJ21CBL0T,Great game but a few issues with this edition,"  I'm writing a review of this edition of Taboo, not the game in general, which is great!There are a few issues with this edition of Taboo, which likely have been covered thoroughly in other reviews, so I'll just go over them briefly.- The squeaker: it doesn't have the same impact of the traditional buzzer and isn't as fun to use. Also, dogs will seriously think it's a toy for them as it sounds exactly like a dog squeaky toy.- No card holder: In a game in which you flip through cards under a time limit, it was nice to have the old holder so you can easily flip through cards. Now you just hold a loose stack of cards and place the used ones on the table or floor - just a bit messy and disorganized. I tried getting a holder from one of the old games, but these cards are a tiny bit too big to fit, so it doesn't work.- Text size: Compared to the old cards (see picture for comparison), these ones have smaller text, and a different word on top and bottom of each side of the card (so total of 4 words). This makes the text of the ""taboo"" words just a bit on the small side, so if you're watching to make sure your opponent isn't saying the words, you may have to lean in a little to read them. Of course there are twice as many words for a given amount of cards, but I liked the simplicity of having one word per card side.Great, fun game to play with friends but I would look for an older edition for a better playing experience. You might just have to explain a few words like Y2K to some of your younger friends.",3.0
2988,B00D4NJSBW,RPUNWZU0YDSK5,"An all-time favorite, even with 2 or 3 players","  Taboo has been one of my all-time favorite games.- It's a super simple game to understand.- It's hilarious to see how people act under pressure. I've been in tears laughing while playing this game. People can say the funniest things, especially since the game is designed in a way that makes you speak in strange ways since you're permitted from use certain words.- It's a great party game, as it requires little explanation, and you can easily pick it up and put it down whenever you're tired of playing.- You don't always need to keep score. Taboo is a game that's fun to just play without worrying about score.- Great for families, kids, or friends.PLAYING WITH 2 OR 3 PLAYERS:While Taboo is technically for 4+ players, I've had a lot of fun playing it with 2 and 3 players. With 3 players, you each take turns giving clues while the other two players guess. The person who guesses correctly gets 1 point, and the clue giver also gets one point, so everyone is incentivized to guess correctly. 2 players isn't as fun, since one player can easily prevent the other from scoring, but if you're less worried about score, this game can still be a lot of fun with just 2 people. One person guesses while the other gives clues. The clue giver is the only one who can score, so each player must make an honest effort when guessing.",5.0
2989,B00D4NJSBW,R3DY08WXUD09HE,Customizable to include those under age 13,"  This is our family's favorite game - kids and grandparents included.  We have an 11 year old so we don't play by all the rules (we don't use the dice) but use everything else including the timer. He loves this game and most of all has improved immensely in the past year that we are now going to try playing with all the rules.  The game requires at least 2 teams of two players.  One player will be given a card and will have to explain the word 'Horse' for example to their teammate without using a list of Taboo words such as animal, mane, hay etc.  No actions or noises allowed.  It forces you to get creative with your words and explanations.  Highly recommend!",5.0
2990,B00D4NJSBW,R13A3QWJGET170,"Excellent game for parties, dinners, etc. Highly recommend!","  After 35+ years of playing games of various sorts, this still remains one of our family favorites! Well thought out and loads of fun to play! One of my favorite memories of teen years was playing this with a neighbor's family. They were at our house, and the dad was an attorney. He and my dad teamed up, and each of them literally said ONE WORD to the other one, and the other one would guess the correct word!! I wish I had video taped it, as it was a classic episode of game playing - they were totally in sync and it showed how fabulous this game can be and how fast paced it can move! It was always lots of fun to watch the women play too, because women have the gift of gab so could usually come up with clues for long enough to get a correct answer from even the slowest of brains!",5.0
2991,B00D4NJSBW,R3UQDNDGH2LNYL,Fun game,  I had played this about 10 years ago at a party after everyone had a few cocktails and remembered how fun it was.

2992,B00D4NJSBW,R3MQN4056RTE2M,"Consistently fun, for a wide range of players","  Always fun to play. Has been a hit with different groups of people, including most recently (somewhat to my surprise) my mom and sister who love Scrabble but have never liked any of the popular party board games. I almost took off a star because this latest version of the game seems significantly easier than older editions - our teams of two people almost always figured out the mystery word, whereas in the past a lot of words went unguessed. Despite this, everyone had a good time and wanted to play again which IMO is what counts most.",5.0
2993,B00D4NJSBW,R17LIQN4TF0NEU,My Family‚Äôs Favorite Game,"  This game is my family‚Äôs all-time favorite game.  As another reviewer wrote, however, there are a few minor issues with this specific edition:- The squeaker: It‚Äôs not a traditional buzzer like previous versions, and as result, is not as much fun.  Also, dogs will honestly think it's a toy for them as it sounds exactly like a dog squeaky toy.- No card holder: In a game in which you flip through cards under a time limit, it was nice to have the old holder so you can easily flip through cards.  Now you just hold a loose stack of cards and try to figure out where to put them.- Text size: The font on each card is super small.  I hope you‚Äôre not near-sighted like me!",5.0
2994,B00D4NJSBW,RGF1572IB7X8F,Fun and Funny,"  Why I chose this game:-I bought this game because I had played it a few times and was VERY good at it. I wanted something I could challenge my friends to, and then blow them out of the water.-I also bought this game to play with my father when he visits. We don't have a lot in common, so it's often difficult to find things for us to do together for ""quality time"". Board games are usually a universal way to bring people together.PROS:-You'll definitely get some laughs with this game.-It's easy to play, and those who have never played can learn the game rules and be playing in probably under 3 minutes.-It's a game I would play with my parent, so that should tell you that it's not too risque of a game despite its name.CONS:-I did notice the timer thing is a bit funny, like other reviewers have said. I didn't mind this though, as I like to use the timer on my phone anyway as it is easier to control.Ultimately, I would recommend this game to any of my friends with glowing reviews.",5.0
2995,B00D4NJSBW,R3S9X9ZPN56QFT,Used it as an expansion,"  We play Taboo so much that we started to repeat the same cards over and over. We basically bought this edition just to use it as an expansion to the 2010 edition with the battery operated ""uhoh"" buzzer. The cards fit in/on the holder, and for that reason I'm pleased with it. If I bought this as a standalone game, I'd be a little disappointed because:1. The squeaker is a dog toy. Let's not pretend.2. There is no holder like previous editions.This edition is worth it as an expansion though. I might even buy the Midnight edition in the future for the same reason.",4.0
2996,B00D4NJSBW,R2JCLVQ12P7UII,Great addition to game night!,"  I bought this as an addition to our monthly game night. It brings out the competitive side to everyone. The clicker is a little different from other versions of taboo. My older game has a button for the beep, whereas this one comes with a rubber noise maker you squeeze. Still does the trick but maybe that could be a turn off to some. It comes with plenty of cards with words on both sides and a choice of 4 different lists. The die is something to mention as it's different from normal taboo. There's I believe 8 different sides to the die and each side of the die means a different thing.  From play the normal way to each team can participate. It's a good game to test your brain power and fast thinking skills. It's also kid friendly which is a plus.",5.0
2997,B00D4NJSBW,R18YX8DSKB73R2,Cheap product,"  I have been playing Taboo for years and boy was I very disappointed when I opened this game.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is still fun to play.  I have owned several versions of the game and here are the differences.  In this version the cards are paper thin, where other versions, the cards were laminated.  I will say you get more clues because four come on a card.  There is no holder for the cards so it is hard to keep turn the cards and pass the cards from player to player especially if you are playing with a large group.  It gets messy.  The buzzer is a rubber squeak toy.  I had to substitute with spoons and bowls because it was driving my dog crazy because he thought it was his toy.  I am keeping the game because I have an older version where I can use the holder and the buzzer.  Otherwise it is cheap.  I would have been willing to pay the extra money to have a better made game.",2.0
2998,B00D4NJSBW,R6D3QVJFBME3N,Fun Game,"  My daughter wanted this for Christmas. I've played the game before, but we have never owned it. I was telling her about the buzzer feature and was surprised to learn that there is no buzzer. Instead, there is a plastic vinyl squeezable squeaker instead. We were playing it at a friend's house and their dog was very interested in the squeezer. It's very similar to a dog squeeze toy. So we had to be careful with it and put it away when not in use. The game play was pretty much how I remembered it. It's a fun game for groups.",5.0
2999,B00D4NJSBW,R1NCBAWRQ9ZKSA,Great for entertainment,"  I've had this game before.  It was actually ""stolen"" 3x lol It's that entertaining!! lolActually, every time I go to my friends/family's place, I'd always bring Taboo, but bc everyone wants to play it every time, I just end up leaving the game there. Hence, my 4th time buying this.It's perfect for all demographics, friends, family, or strangers events. It makes a great gift.The game is very easy to play; you just gotta be a quick thinker and a million dollar vocab helps, too.Each card is has a set of words (taboo words) and the word to be guessed at the top.  The person whose turn it is must describe the word to his or her teammate without saying the taboo words.",5.0
3000,B00D4NJSBW,RYFTTKYRE0FUE,Where's the Buzzer?!?!,"  Who doesn't like taboo? It's a fun party game, BUT sometime between the first few I bought for myself and gifts, they changed a classic feature. Now, instead of the electronic buzzer, Hasbro replaced it with what is essentially a handheld whoopy cushion. It's lame. The BUZZER kind of made the game. The new handheld squeaker thing feels cheap and everyone who had played before longed for the days with the buzzer. If you're thinking of buying this game, I highly recommend finding an older version with the buzzer. You'll be glad you did. I promise it makes a difference.",3.0
3001,B00D4NJSBW,R2XOUUH26U8XZ5,The old version is better!,"  I LOVE Taboo- who doesn't!? I was very excited to open this brand new set with a group of friends recently. However, opening this version of the game was such a letdown! It's designed for ants! Here are the top three reasons this version stinks:1. There are no card holders. What the heck! You either have to hold the cards in your hand as you flip them, or use what I think is a makeshift card holder built into the box. The cardholder is a central piece of the game. HOW in the world could they have eliminated this?!2. The cards are tiny (therefore, font is tiny) and are about as thin as copy paper. They feel cheap and unimportant in your hand. Nothing like real playing cards!3. The ""buzzer"" is pathetic. It is not even a buzzer, it is basically a plastic dog toy and the sound it makes is a shy, airy squeak.",3.0
3002,B00D4NJSBW,R3HC1AW25YJU3J,Game arrived in good condition with all parts,"  Game arrived in good condition with all parts. My only qualm is that the original buzzer has been replaced by a squeaker and I have a dog that has been trained to viciously rip these out of toys she gets on the regular. I opened the game with excitement, testing everything out. While fiddling with the squeaker (it is not easy to squeek) I finally managed to create noise and to my horror, my dog dropped the ball she was actively playing with, with my father-in-law and directed all attention to the Taboo squeaker. I spent 5 minutes explaining to the dog that the squeaker was mine but already in play mode, my dog did not want to hear it and incessantly stared into my soul for the one thing in the world she knew was for sure hers from the damn noise. I put the game back in the box and she sniffed and stared for another 5 minutes before moving on with her life.I will likely give her the squeaker next time the box is opened as I am not strong of will. We will be forced to verbally abused those who mess up to ensure they know they have made a mistake.If you have a dog, I would recommend a different version of the game or practice making buzzer noises. There's probably an app for that.",4.0
3003,B00D4NJSBW,R1P66OYVOHX893,"Excellent game, too much packaging","  We love this game and think it's the perfect night-cap when we have family and friends over. Here are my findings:1. I got this game for a family game night on vacation. Our vacation was on a sailboat for a week, so we had to be careful with our packing--the boat only had limited storage space--as did our luggage. So, I took all of the items out of this box and they fit into a small Ziploc bag...way too much packaging!2. This particular game comes with a squeeze buzzer, rather than the battery-powered buzzer that the older version comes with. That means that we have to put my dog in the garage when we play because he gets to excited about the squeeze noise.3. The box comes with a pad to keep score for only two teams per sheet. We played with three teams, so we had to modify the pad. It's a tiny pad, so it was a little difficult to see our tiny little hashes when it was time to tally the score. Also, there was no pencil with the box, so we had to look through bags on the boat to find one.I love this game and would buy it over and over.",5.0
3004,B00D4NJSBW,R35OO1LKD2BL7M,Very Satisfied - Why ??? Read On !!!,"  I always like games promote communication. Taboo is one of many. Avalon is a better one !!!I am a light to medium strategy gamer, so I rarely touch the ""Mass Market Board Games"" but I have a weak spot for Taboo and Password because I consider myself is a awesome clue giver ~ ~ ~Components:- Very high quality squeaker, people here are complaining about they switch from the electronic buzzer to a squeaker, come on, simple is better, and no batter is needed.- Sand timer is good and the die is heavy for its size and very good quality.- I like it how they are 4 words per card now, so you get 162 cards in the game which means you are getting 648 words per game. This increase the replayability of the game ~Game play:- House rule. I bought this game with the intention to play with international students, and regular Taboo is already hard for most native English speakers, therefore to house rule it, you can play it backward, all you can say is the 5 words listed below the word you are trying to get people to guess. Try it and see what happened ~Full Disclosure:- One other thing makes me like this game is I bought it for $6.99 + tax here on Amazon with FREE Shipping !!! What a Deal ~",5.0
3005,B00D4NJSBW,R3E8O6HK9SX0S2,Great game that forces you to think quickly,"  I love to play this game with friends, family, and my high school students. I love the fact that this game forces you to think on your feet as well as explain something to another person in a roundabout way. It's always great fun. I would recommend not playing this game with young children due to the difficulty level.I don't like the new ""buzzer,"" as before it was a battery operated buzzer that made this great, loud, obnoxious sound when your opponent said a forbidden word. This one is battery free, which is nice, but it sounds more like an annoying dog toy.",4.0
3006,B00D4NJSBW,R3M7STZE2VOXWW,Good but the Original is Better.,"  The original game is much easier and more fun to play so if you do not have that, I recommend buying that one instead. This is a decent game for anyone who has never played before or who has played the original version so many times that they need a refresh version. This game has a squeaker instead of a buzzer as in the original. It also does not have a card holder, which made game play more erratic as it puts pressure on the ""caller"" to make sure they don't set it down so everyone can see, or wave it around- or a many variety of other accidental mistakes we kept running into.",3.0
3007,B00D4NJSBW,R34QPCIZFVH14G,Great game,"  It's a very fun game and a lot of people can play it at the same time. The game is played in teams. You get a word and your teammates have to guess what the word is by the clues you give them. It gets a little difficult because some words you are not allowed to use, which are the obvious clues to the answer. The person next to you holds a buzzer and buzzes when you use one of the clues on the do not use list. When you get buzzed, you lost that round and the point goes to the opposing team. It can get rowdy and it really liven up the party. My kids as young as eight were able to play it although some they wouldn't be able to answer. Adults in their 60s were playing it as well. Great game.",5.0

3010,B00D4NJSBW,R169TQHVU4O5UF,Boring Cards,"  This version is a serious downgrade from the original game. I love Taboo and had a lot of fun playing it. My dislike of this game is mainly because the cards are very simple. This is supposed to be updated and modernized, but there are more cards that say basic things like Zebra, Spy, Tickle, Brown, or Jedi. The older version of the game has more creative cards with celebrity names, movie titles, places, etc. You can easily download (free) better versions of this game on your phones app store.If you mainly play this with children or tweens, this might not be a bad choice. If you are more of a Cards Against Humanity player... don't purchase this game.",1.0

Super fun to see what you'll have to describe without saying the words listed on the card! Definitely not a game you can play in the car since there are so many cards and you‚Äôll need to be able to see and hear your partner(s) well to be able to guess.

I wanted a game for casual players, as having guests at home that do not play it often, so must be simple enough to learn its dynamic in the first 30 minutes instead of multiple game sessions, and it is what I looked for.

3015,B00D4NJSBW,R1MO57BETUVU1E,Newer version is cheaper than original,"  My parents had Taboo when I was growing up, and we used to love to play it (especially in large groups). I recently got married and purchased this for our own game collection. I was a little disappointed at the new game style. Instead of a buzzer, there is now an annoying little squeaker. There is no card holder like in the older version, so there is no easy way of keeping the cards together while you play. I looked into returning this and purchasing an older version; however, the older version is much more expensive, since it is considered vintage now. We decided just to keep this one.

Whenever we have Family Game Night at church, this is the game everyone wants to play!  Younger children may not know a lot of the words to be able to play, but it's fun for them to try.  It really helps with your vocabulary and you need to be very creative to get your team to say the word without you saying the TABOO word!",5.0
3017,B07L437XBJ,R3H7F8IQMXYO9J,Best game! Don‚Äôt let it intimidate you!,"  One of the best games ever! Don‚Äôt let the amount of pieces in the box scare you. If you‚Äôre not good with following directions on paper, watch some YouTube videos on how to play. Once you get the concept, you‚Äôll want to keep playing again and again. The expansions are so much fun once you play a few rounds of the standard game. I strongly suggest playing a few rounds without the expansion so you can grasp the concept of the game before adding in new rules. It will be much less complicated that way. This game is great regardless if it‚Äôs 2 players or 5...the more players, the longer the game play. Everyone in our group has different strategies and everyone has won at least once...so what works for one, may not work for another or what worked for someone during one game, may not work in another game. This is one of our top games, though, and we‚Äôve played a LOT during our game nights with friends.",5.0
3018,B07L437XBJ,R22DVYAA25WSR7,The expansions are worth it.,"  I played this game without expansions at a friend's house for the first time.  I had previewed it online and discounted it as too simple and boring.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  The game is high in strategy, easy to learn or teach, and high replayability.  The expansions aren't necessary but are well worth the price for the big box.  With a random layout and using  zero, one, or both expansions, it's never the same game twice.  It plays extremely well with all player counts.All of the components are very good quality with one exception.  The cardboard money doesn't seem to hold up really well.  I recommend just getting metal coins.  This is such a minor flaw that it still gets 5 stars in my book.In short this has become one of my favorite games, and gets to the table more often than just about any other game I own.",5.0
3019,B07L437XBJ,R18NMHVKV3ZXA3,Great Deal!,"  Looks more complicated than it is.  Plays smoothly. It's a light, collect and deliver type game with a unique movement aspect.  Personally, it feels comparable to Genoa without the bidding. Standard, decent quality components.  The board with all expansions takes some space and set up the first few times can take some time.  My husband and I recently bought a bunch of board games that can play well with just 2 people but also sometimes three or more and I'd say this fit the bill.  Chose this one because the expansions come with it.  Great deal!",5.0
3020,B07L437XBJ,R1MHK96SLKRQE8,A regular at the table,"  If you plan on buying at least one expansion, the Big Box is a better value.

The replacement was better, but after our first play and we were putting things back into the box, we realised that the box edge was damaged.

3039,B0084M8UEE,R2B5MX5TPKKAWP,One of our favorite co-op games!,"  Flash Point Fire Rescue is a cooperative board game for 1-6 players. The game comes with two ‚Äúmodes‚Äù, a basic game and an advanced mode. The advanced mode almost reminds me more of an included expansion. This review will focus primarily on the beginner mode, but we will discuss the advanced mode later.In both games the goal is basically the same, save 7-10 victims of the fire. Along the way, you will have to deal with smoke, fire, explosions, wall collapses, and in the more advanced game, hazmat and hotspot areas. My play experience with this game is limited to two players. This makes the more advanced game a little too cumbersome if you want to take advantage of all the various characters. In the basic mode, each character has the exact same abilities.In the basic game, each player receives a generic firefighter with basic abilities. You get four points (called Action Points or APs) to use each turn. Various actions, such as walking, putting out a fire, changing a fire to smoke, putting out smoke, chopping down walls (be careful with this), and carrying victims costs so many points. If you have points at the end of your turn, you can bank them by taking tokens. You can also share your extra points with another player.How to Win: Rescue the correct number of victims depending on the mode of play (basic mode is 7).How to lose: There are two ways you can lose in Flash Point Fire Rescue.1. If you allow four victims to die (get caught in an explosion or fire) you lose. It should be noted that your firefighter does not die when caught in a fire/explosion, but is blown all the way to the nearest parking spot. He must then re-enter the building either through a main door or collapsed wall.2. You can also lose if the building collapses from too much damage to walls (using black cubes to track).My Review This is one of the go to games for my wife and I. As mentioned before, we primarily play the basic game. It provides enough challenge to prevent us from winning each time, but still makes winning both achievable and challenging at the same time.The instruction book was clear and easy to read, though early on, we seemed to refer to it frequently, especially with regards to explosions and how damaged walls and open doors can affect the game.The components are pretty solid and the two sided board does allow for even more variety. I suppose my biggest complaint is that the firefighters are different colors, but other than that are identical. It would have been nice to have had more unique characters, especially for the advanced mode.Update: (Dec 2017) - My wife and I played this game as a four player beginner game and found this a bit cumbersome. It seems it is probably best with 3 as it always seemed like one player didn't really know what to do. Overall ratings not affected, but I would hesitate to put four in the game unless you are playing the expert variant. Overall Ratings:Instructions: 8/10Ease of Play: Basic Mode: 8/10Components: 7/10Replay Value: 10/10 (If you roll for where to place the fire/victims at the start instead of using the standard setup.)Overall Rating: 8.25",4.0
3040,B0084M8UEE,R2VTGUJMNOHF5P,"Excellent value for an accessible, enjoyable game","  Finally, a co-op game that doesn't suffer from the ""Alpha Gamer"" problem, of one gamer having to quarterback everyone else's moves for them! My experience with co-op games hasn't been great. Pandemic, Spirit Island, Ghost Stories, all left me flat. With Flash Point, however, you get a game that's as ""thinky"" as you want it to be, but without the punishing nature of one bad move ruining the whole game.On top of that, it's incredibly easy to grasp. I brought this on a business trip to play with colleagues after-hours. Most of them non-gamer types, were able to grasp it in a few minutes and we were able to pull of a 75% win-rate using the ""experienced"" rules on the lowest difficulty...and had a great time doing it! Granted, there is a strong dice-rolling element in this, so randomness can either help or hinder you, but a well played game can, but wont always, mitigate some of that.The components are great quality, you get a double sided game-board for different experiences and different difficulties, and there are so many expansions for this that take the game in many different directions. For the price, this is a great value. When you compare the price per hour to things like movies, you'll get your money's worth out of just a handful of plays.",5.0
3041,B0084M8UEE,R10R9GIH74Q0VJ,Easier to win but no less fun than other co-op games,"  I supervise an after-school game group for teens (mostly boys), and they're pretty good board gamers.  (I played the 'Lord of the Rings' co-op game with them and we actually won.  If you've tried it, you might know how difficult that is.)  We jumped right into the advanced rules of Flash Point (Recruit Level) and it was pretty easy for us, but the boys immediately wanted to play it again at a higher difficulty level, which speaks volumes to me about the fun-factor and replay value of 'Flash Point.'Like most cooperative games, each player has a specific role within the group based on their skill or character.  Flash Point is unique in that players can actually change their specializations during the game, so you don't get stuck the entire time with a skill that becomes useless or redundant at some point.  I think the player specializations in 'Flash Point' are more thematic than in any other cooperative game.  In 'Shadows Over Camelot' (my other favorite) for example, character skills allow you to do things like pass cards between players or look at the top card of a deck - helpful, but artificial.  In 'Flash Point,' your skills might allow you to treat wounded victims, dispose of hazmat, or use the truck to spray a large area - things real firefighters actually DO.Most co-operative games follow the formula of ""take your actions and then something bad usually happens"" on each player's turn.  Players then must talk and decide how to utilize each of their skills to slow down the bad stuff while working toward their shared objectives.  Nothing new in that area here, but again it's the way the design incorporates things like chain explosions and structural damage to create tension and a sense of urgency that fit the theme of firefighting so well.Currently there are still only a handful of cooperative board games on the market, and they vary in degree of difficulty.  I've played nearly all of them, and they're pretty good.  'Forbidden Island' and 'Castle Panic' are great for younger kids because they set up and play quickly and are easier to win.  'Shadows Over Camelot' and 'Lord of the Rings' can be extremely trying even for the experienced, but deeply satisfying.  I'd put 'Flash Point' and 'Pandemic' in the middle.  I prefer 'Flash Point' primarily for the variety of firefighter specializations, and the greater sense of thematic tension that comes from trying to rescue everyone as fire and explosions tear through the building.",5.0
3042,B0084M8UEE,R6F0PHE0YB9N9,My great cooperative game that everyone will love,"  Super fun game! A good coop game. I've had many friends over to play and everyone (ranging from those who do not really like strategy games, to those who love them) has enjoyed it. I've liked it so much that sometimes I play it by myself. It isn't overly complicated so new players can quickly learn the rules and have meaningful opinions.It is coop, so everyone wins or everyone looses. This means that people who don't like strategy games will not feel like they are being dominated by those who do. Everything is important. Every character role is worth playing. You will regret ignoring hazardous material. Ignoring how much damage the house is taking will lead to its collapse.I personally think that this is slightly more fun than Pandemic (and I really like Pandemic). It feels more exciting.",5.0
3043,B0084M8UEE,RBP2RYJ0WCLJ,Easy to Learn Hard to Win,"  This is possibly one of my favorite coop games of all time.  The mechanics and rules(Basic Rules) are fairly simple, yet it does give you the feeling of being a firefighter.  You're wandering through a burning house, searching for victims and things are exploding all around you.  Then, you are almost out of the  house and a fire flares up right on top of you and you're knocked down and you've lost a victim.  It really is  an ingenious game and quite a lot of fun.  I've not played with all the player counts, but for even two players it is fun. I think it would do well at gaming conventions, also.  I will probably run it at the next one I attend.  Now, I've not played with any of the ""advanced rules"", but I have read them over.  At first, it seemed they had a potential for adding a lot of complexity to  the game, but I think if you, as the designer suggested, add in a few new rules at a time until you get used to them, there shouldn't be any problem.  Some see these new rules and player abilities as ""pigeon-holing"" them to certain roles and that might be true to a certain extent, every player still has the capability to enter the house and rescue victims.  The hot spots do give the potential for really spreading the fire fast, but with the ability to  shower down water from above, I believe it balances out.  All in all, a great, fun game with lots of replayability and with the expansions you have a lot of options for new game boards and new scenarios. Top notch game.",5.0
3044,B0084M8UEE,R6G7TENCGH28O,One Of The Best CO-OP Games Around and Really Fun For Children.,"  One of the best co-op games I've played and I've played a lot of them. My biggest problem with a lot of co-op games is that it's really easy for one experienced player to sort of ""dominate"" the game and it becomes little more than one player doing everything while everyone else sort of sits there and watches. This can happen without the person ""quarterbacking"" even realizing they're doing it. While it can happen in Flash Point it's not as common. The game is set up in a way that each player can make their own decisions and regardless of natural strategic abilities still be effective. This is also a terrific game to play with children. While it may be slightly dark in tone (having a victim burn up if you're team is unable to save them on time) the art is abstract enough that it's not overly so.",5.0
3045,B0084M8UEE,RBXJ92QDY0WUS,A simple but instantly engrossing struggle against ever-worsening odds that has depth (and a bunch of nice details).,"  One of the most enjoyable games I know that can be played in less than an hour, Flash Point Fire Rescue is a superior, more detailed variation of a dire situation game like Pandemic. Instead of dealing with abstractions in a distant global setting, FPFR puts the players (or player) in a burning house where collapsing walls, exploding hazmats, and imperiled victims compete for every precious action point while the second hand of destruction moves forward.A good combination of luck and skill, this game is a fun and exciting losing battle in which players must make life saving and life ending decisions every turn and hope that the courses chosen and the courses neglected result in the most saved people.The character skills also mix things up nicely, though maybe the Imaging Technician's special skill of identifying Points of Interest is too powerful (choosing that character really improved my success rate right away), but the game is smart, exciting, and the deployment of the vehicles is an especially fun variable. Behold the deck guns!Unlike Agricola (which is clever but has far too much piece relocation/counting for my taste), Pandemic (which is fairly decent but kind of annoying and very abstract), and Catan (which I thought was quite dull), Flash Point Fire Rescue is a good gateway game that fires my gamer imagination and can show off the merits of modern board games to curious non-gamers as well. A simple but instantly engrossing struggle against ever worsening odds with depth and a bunch of nice details.",4.0
3046,B0084M8UEE,R2P3MUWUXWWCOU,Fun but very based on luck,"  It's pretty fun. I really enjoy it. It's just kind of luck-based...my husband and I have played 4 times now. 1 game was tough, we nearly lost, but the other 3 games it felt like we got really lucky and won easily. So I think it's more luck-based than I was expecting. It makes sense when half the game is based on dice rolls, but I just didn't realize it would affect the game so much.Don't get me wrong, it's fun and a great length--a game usually takes us 30-45 minutes, which is perfect when you only have a little bit of time and don't want to get into a giant complicated fantasy game or something. I don't regret buying it.",4.0
3047,B0084M8UEE,R2ZMZMZFD81RA2,A modern co-op classic.,"  If you like cooperative board games like Pandemic, Flashpoint should be added to your collection as well. While it's a little more fiddly than Pandemic, once you learn the rules it's no less fun and frantic. I can't think of much else to say because it's a great players-vs-game experience with plenty of strategy and well-balanced difficulty so you probably won't win every time. A family variant is included in the rulebook to simplify things for younger players as well. The firefighter theme is also great, it's a nice break from the constant fantasy and sci-fi themed board games out there.If you like games like Pandemic or prefer to cooperate instead of compete, Flashpoint is an easy recommendation.",5.0
3048,B0084M8UEE,R1TQU8AK60HT67,"So great I imeadiately bought the add-ons! Like, ALL the add-ons.","  This game is fantastic!I'm a big fan of co-op board games, and this one is not only incredible to play again and again, but also easy to teach to beginners.What really sets this game apart is the tiered difficulty levels. Have someone who's never played? Start with the base setup and walk it through. Have some regulars who want a bit more of a challenge? Ramp it up with the modifiers and add the job system!I loved it so much I went right out to Kickstarter and supported the add-on pack he was trying to create- and donated enough to the cause to get all the other add-ons, too!There's a reason all of his games fund as well as they do on Kickstarter; they're addicting, adaptable, and extremely re-playable!Highly recommend for your board game shelf. You... DO have a board game shelf, don't you?",5.0
3049,B0084M8UEE,R2ON35Q3W6XO9T,Super family game with many different level of difficulty,"  This game is a great family game.  I'd say ages 8 and up based on ability to concentrate. This game has so many options you can add into play.  You start very basic to learn the rules, and the first game will be slow and challenging and you questions things, look up answers in the instructions and play it through...but then you are hooked and you'll want to play again and again.PARENTS- a word of caution, you may want to play the first game on your own or with older children because the first game is slow and will quickly lose the interest of a younger child. But by the time you play it the 2nd and definitely by the 3rd time...you've got it figured out and it plays smoothly and with excitement.After you figure out the basic rules, you can add in all sorts of different levels of difficulty.  The back of the board has a different floor plan for more advanced play as well as many, many options.  The great thing is you pick and choose what you want in each game you play.  The game is built to be flexible and it's like having 30 different levels of a game all in one.  AWESOME!",5.0
3050,B0084M8UEE,R3M3SM2A0KKDGY,Top Notch fun and customizable cooperative game,"  I bought this for a family of adults to enjoy on game night. So far we've played it at 'Family' level (basic game) and enjoyed it. My son-in-law, who is a paramedic, found it mostly realistic, which is rare in a board game. My son and I have played it at 'Recruit' level, omitting some of the additional rules. That's a great feature of the game: the rules are well balanced so that you can pick and choose which ones you want to play without skewing the game. We like that you can change roles so you don't get stuck with an obsolete role. And, if there's only two of you, you can each control a couple of fire fighters. Although there is a certain amount of luck involved, real fires are unpredictable too. We were within one space of winning the game (just had to get the last victim out the door) when the building collapsed on us. The way in which the game handles fires, explosions, damage, flashover, shockwave, etc, give a degree of realism and suspense to the game. The rules are clearly written and logically laid out, so if you follow them step by step, it makes perfect sense. (I hate games where the rules are so poorly written you spend longer trying to figure them out than playing the game). Flash Point also includes two different maps with one being more challenging than the other. In short, it's enjoyable, realistic, and replayable.Update: We've now played the game at all difficulties levels and I've played it solo a number of times. I'm even more impressed. The game scales well and is flexible enough that if you're creative, you can make up your own hazards, specialists, and victory conditions. This now my absolute favorite board game. I like it better than Pandemic, to which is is often compared, because Pandemic is too abstract for me. (In Pandemic, you're pushing little plastic cubes around the map.) Flash Point is realistic enough that I find myself immersed in the world of the game, almost like a roleplaying game.",5.0
3051,B0084M8UEE,R1AJC8JVQ1VGYG,Everyone I played this with loved it,"  I was looking for a new cooperative game and came across this on a Youtube channel.  I play with my girlfriend and friends Castle Panic and we all love it so I was excited to give this one a shot.  I played this with both a friend of mine who is into more comprehensive games and 2 others who are into more mild and tame games and all of them loved it.  The game has a decent amount to it, and there is quite a bit you have to remember, but once you play through it, it is not complex or difficult.  It is a lot of fun and we were getting really into it. I liked how the board has two sides with 2 different house layouts so it adds some change in the game, as well as the fact you can basically set the game up however you want by just choosing how many fires to start with and rolling to see where they go.  One thing I found was the game has a ""quick start guide"" and then advanced rules, where, actually, strangely enough, the advanced rules actually make the game easier as each firefighter gets certain abilities.  We just stick to the basic rules and have a blast.  There are also expansions for this game which is nice as well!  If you like cooperative games, I highly recommend this for any type of gamer.",5.0
3052,B0084M8UEE,R27NI4PKV0NA4P,Big Damn Heroes!,"  Every time you go back into a building that is about to collapse to save one more survivor, or keep fighting the fire to give the rest of the team a few more seconds, you really feel the risk.  When one of your team can't make it out in time, it can be crushing.  And even when you all make it out, it can really feel like failure if you know you can't rescue everyone inside, even when you have rescued enough to 'win'.  So when you do get everyone safely out, and the crew has all survived, you feel like big damn heroes.  [a Firefly reference]",5.0
3053,B0084M8UEE,R306Y1XR4QEBGR,Go to cooperative game for family and middle school kids,"  So glad we found this game after looking for more cooperative games to enjoy with middle school teens. We've played it several times already with our boys, one of whom rarely wants to play games, especially more than once! He actually likes this one. We are going to use it for a teen game club soon also. My empath heart does get sad if we lose someone to the fire, but it also prompts good discussion about it being worth trying - even if/when we sometimes fail at things in real life - for the times when we succeed.  Glad to have an alternative theme like this in a cooperative game that isn't all about fighting something, even as a team! Money well spent for this one. Game component quality also good. This one has us looking for more like it.",5.0
3054,B0084M8UEE,R137RVMZZ57XT4,A Wonderful Chance,"  This was a chance purchase. I didn't know what this game was about but it looked interesting so I got it. What a wonderful surprise! I've found that most people that I introduce this to love playing it. Even ones that are scared of thinking games like this one.What I love of this game is that it is a cooperative game. Everybody wins or everybody dies.There are quite a bit of rules but if you take it one step at a time it isn't hard and many people pick it up quickly. If you can read and follow rules then you can play. There is a set of easier family set of rules and game play that is easier for beginners and there are advanced rules that add more dynamics to the game. The advanced game play adds characters with special jobs that help or hinder you. The advanced game play also adds hazardous material that could explode and it also adds the use of the firetruck.  Flashpoint has very high replay value. Every game is different.My family has mostly played the Family set of rules because we seem to introduce this to many different people and so those are easier to start out with.  One family that was introduced want to play it again because they think of new strategies to play.There are two sides to the board so there are two house layouts. One side is way harder than the other side because there are less doors that lead to outside. This game really makes you think about your own house layout and if it is safe and what should we do in case of a fire.It really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you get to save one of the victims in the house. It can make someone tense and even sad if we lose one of the victims. We really get into the game. It makes us think that we should be grateful that we aren't really in this situation for real and also makes us have deeper respect for real firefighters.The game pieces are nice; the art is amazing. But there wasn't any way to keep them neat after you pop them out of the cardboard they came in. So we have been putting them back into the cardboard holder that they came in. It is a puzzle game after the game to fit them in the correct spot. So that is fine but I don't know what we are going to do when they get too loose to be securely held in place.We always have good fun playing this with varying age groups. My family laughs at me every time because I'm now known as the one that wants to break down the walls. We actually died at least once because I chopped down a wall and the house collapsed on us. Not in that order; there were just too many explosions.Funny tidbit: One time I went to save one of the victims and I turn over the piece to see if it was a victim or not and I wondered, ""Why are we saving the coffee pot?""  The picture was upside down and it was actually the dog.",5.0
3055,B0084M8UEE,R2VKQ9M6QWSXCP,Great cooperative game for families and gamers,"  My family and I love this game. This game helped us realize that cooperative games are best for our family- otherwise the kids (8 and 13 yo) get too competitive with one another and game night turns ugly. (Pandemic was also a success)Flash Point is a cooperative (team) game for 2-6 players that plays in about 30 minutes. We've played the Family level 4-5 times so far and won each time - but only barely. the last time we played we did add a bunch of rules from the Expert level, but now we are ready to make it even tougher. I introduced this to my adult game group last week and they all enjoyed it, too. i haven't tried any of the expansions yet because I think we have a lot more plays to come from the base game still. There is definitely a level of randomness to the game (advancing fire), but the game still plays very well for us.",5.0
3056,B0084M8UEE,R3II7BY2N71ABJ,The whole family was engrossed!!,"  Saturday, January 26th. Played with my wife Anna, and three of my children, Patience, Charity and Gentry. Super fun game, but there never was any danger of us losing so if we play again then we‚Äôll have to make it harder. It was still really fun. We played with the special ability cards which might have been what made it too easy for us. We never even encountered an explosion. Cassandra managed a double rescue in one turn which was really cool, and Patience was able to put out an incredible amount of fires with her character.

I built up the excitement by watching YouTube videos and when I finally got it I played it 3 times in a row.  And it is hard, even on easy.  We won 1/3 games.  The mechanics of gameplay can take some time to learn because there is a lot going on but once everyone is on the same page the strategy and co-op really comes to life as you're racing to save victims, choosing between rescuing someone who is fairly safe, putting out a blazing fire that's destroying the house or removing hazardous material that's going to explode and kill a victim.  It gets crazy.  10/10 for sure and I'm super excited about the expansions.",5.0
3058,B0084M8UEE,R21VKFT9HTB9CV,"By far the best, most reliable Co-Op board game I've played. Tons of replay value.","  I am a heavy duty board game fan and have played many co-ops. This is my ""go to"" game for a co-op. What is a co-op board game? It is a game where the players work as a team to beat the board game. The game has several expansions which really expand on the playability of the game and they are reasonably priced, but the base game is replayable enough as it is. It has a double sided map (one more difficult than the other) and the game has three or four difficulty settings (family, rookie, veteran, etc.) as well, so if you find yourself beating the rookie level, maybe it is time for the veteran level.  Whenever I bring this game to my gaming group, there is a 90%that it gets to the table. That should tell you something.",5.0
3059,B0084M8UEE,R38M2MOG8RI09L,This is a great game. There is definitely a learning curve and ...,"  This is a great game. There is definitely a learning curve and we found out that we were playing it ""wrong"" the first time. We had to watch some video tutorials online to get the hang of it. We've only played the easier family version, but it was fun and challenging. Our 8 year old was able to play with us as well.This game can get pretty intense! There's a lot of strategy and higher thinking involved. We really like the cooperative aspect as we don't always agree which is the best way for a player to take their turn. There's some compromising that needs to be done.We can't wait to try the harder level and buy some expansions.I highly recommend this game!",5.0
3060,B0084M8UEE,R2XAEQAE70AN9V,Different Game every time.,"  I've played with 3 different groups and solitaire mode so far.  Very flexible game, even without expansion packs.  Easy to learn basic game play and rules expand and change when your group is ready.  It is a very different game every time it is played because chance influences the fire much more than the players.  There are strategies that in general work better than others but a couple of bad rolls can lead to a collapsed building and a couple of lucky ones can lead to an easy win.  Lots of fun.",5.0
3061,B0084M8UEE,R3L93CT16EZ9O7,My five year old can't get enough,"  We played this as a family today for the first time. Since our son is five, we gave ourselves 8 Action Points per turn instead of four to ensure he felt like he could make some progress. It's still very challenging, and we are loving it. He is playing with the board and pieces and using them to tell stories and go on adventures. We love it, and I love that it will grow with him and that we can still enjoy the more challenging adult rules.",5.0
3062,B0084M8UEE,R2I7OBTQP7UDSF,I enjoy playing this game,"  I'm fan of co-operative games, so that will bias my review some. I enjoy playing this game, but there is a lot to do and the rules are a little complex when playing with all of them. The game first recommends the ""family version"", that strips out a lot of the more detailed rules. This worked well for my seven year old daughter and I at the time. We used the recommendation in the back of the manual for slowly adding in a few more of the rules each time we played. My now-eight year old enjoys this game still, but not as much as others because of the extra complexity. She much prefers Forbidden Island over this one, but we still play this now and then.Playing with all rules on the normal difficulty on side A of the board was actually easy. We never lost one of those games and often decided to keep playing until we completely put the fire out. The last time we played we switched sides and bumped the difficulty up and we lost that game. I think that is the mode we will try to play on a few more times to see if it has the right challenge level.Maybe due to the extra complexity or due to it being a co-operative game and I only know competitive players, I have not managed to convince anyone else to play this game with me (and my daughter) yet.",4.0
3063,B0084M8UEE,R1Q2CF6R09RZZO,great game for family and friends,"  We got this game about 1-2 weeks ago and we love it!The game is exciting and fun for everyone. In case you didn't read the description, it's a cooperative board game about firefighters saving people from a burning building. Cooperative means everyone is on the same team playing against the fire. This game involves a lot of teamwork, strategizing and collaboration. To add to the strategy, players can choose a firefighter specialty.One of the nice things in this game is that it offers 4 difficulty levels, so you can start off easy and try for a challenge when you feel up to it. The easiest is the ""family"" version, then there's rookie, veteran and hero.I will say that the full rules seem a little intimidating at first, but we found progressively adding the advanced rules instead of jumping straight into it made it easier. We played the ""family"" version the first couple times, then the next time we played with the randomized set up for the advanced game and the rules from the ""family"" version, next game we added the Specialists and Hazmats, then finally we tried a game with all the rules. I definitely recommend following a similar progression, it gave me a chance to get familiar with a few rules at a time instead of all at once. Now I feel comfortable explaining the full rules to a new group of players.One note about this game's kid friendliness: My 5 year old can't quite grasp the strategies involved, but he loves the firefighter figures that come with the game. I'd say this game is good for ages 7 and up.Overall, I like this game because it offers a great mix of strategy and excitement. No one we've played it with so far has said anything bad about it. After playing through 6 times, the only thing I can think to complain about is that there are a lot of different pieces to keep sorted. For now I've put everything in ziploc bags, but I'm thinking about buying a small, clear plastic tacklebox to keep it all sorted.A nice bonus that surprised me is that the board is actually double-sided, you can play on either side.",5.0
3064,B0084M8UEE,R2OJTB4RZTCNEF,Fun board game.,"  Update after many months of owning this game: This game is still going strong in my house. We don't always play this game on our family nights but it does get played regularly in our rotation of games. We've moved on to more advanced rules and don't always win. I also like to throw in an exercise for my 9 year old niece by saying ""okay, you are in charge of this firefighting operation - what is the plan this round?"" It's an easy leadership exercise for her that she just loves. All in all, I am still glad I purchased this game.ONE WORD OF ADVICE FOR GAMING EXPERTS: If you play board games regularly and consider yourself a board gaming pro then I'd recommend skipping family rules. They won't challenge you. I'd recommend you skip straight to veteran difficulty.Original Week 1 review:I just got this two days ago, so this game still has that honeymoon period going for it, I'll try and come back after a month and update this review to see if my opinion has changed any.Sometimes you want to sit down with the people you care about and play a game with them. I purchased this game to do something with my niece other then play video games or watch movies with her. I choose this game because I've never played a coop board game before and I know my niece would get a thrill out of working with the adults to win the game.At first the rules seem a little complicated but after a game or two they become extremely easy to follow. That is to say, at least family rules are easy to follow. We haven't graduated to the experienced rule set but given how much we keep playing this game I suspect we will be moving to the experienced rule set very soon. Needless to say my niece, her dad, and I enjoy this game very much so far. Each play through is about 45 minutes total, you're mileage may very given there is a slight random element to this game between the fires and the point of interest.So far at the end of every game my niece asks if we can play it again, which means at the moment we've found something more fun then video games for her. All in all, I do not regret this purchase and I can't wait until my niece gets done with school today so she, her dad, and I can play another round of this game.Side note: I forgot to mention, the game recommends ages 10 and up, but if you focus on the family rule set you might be able to get away with 8 and up. At least my niece is 8 and she seems to be able to follow the game just fine. It depends on your kid, of course.",5.0
3065,B0084M8UEE,R2DPGB9VQDDRQX,Surprisingly Fun,"  My friends and I were concerned first time we started this game. We started going through the instruction manual, starting in the 'beginner' section, but... well to be blunt, we just wanted ot play.So we found a YouTube video. 30 minutes long. We watched all of it.  It made sense but we worried because it took 30 minutes to explain the rules. Apparently those were the advanced rules, so those are how we began playing.The rules are kind of complicated. There are lots of them.BUT! Once you start playing, or as long as 1 person at your table knows what they're doing, it moves along fast.And the game is super fast, super exciting. Every time you think you pushed the fire back something explodes or a victim gets killed.  First try we created the Permadeath houserule so if a fire-fighter gets knocked out then that specialist is dead for good (the player can choose a new specialist and respawn at the truck).  We almost won but all of our wall-chopping ended up being our undoing.Second time we got 7 victims out and there was an 8th one left. Me and another fire fighter decided to run in and save that last victim, even though we had already won, and the building collapsed on us.And that tends to be how the game goes for us. And it makes it a very different boardgame. The endings can be a bit anti-climatic because the goal isn't so set in stone, mainly because you want to play as much as you can. Even if that means putting yourself back into danger.But yeah. Point is- it's fun, Dynamic, great to teach to new people and great at creating cooperation.",5.0
3066,B0084M8UEE,R3OLX6G77VL3IL,Excellent Cooperative game,"  My family really loves cooperative games. Games like Pandemic, Shadows over Camelot, Castle Panic and Forbidden Island are all hits at my house. With all the buzz around Flash Point Fire Rescue, I had to try it out. The game comes with two sets of rules, a basic ""family"" set of rules and the advanced rules. Basic rules are fun, but the advanced rules is where the strategy comes in.The premise is that you are a firefighter and you are rushing into the house to rescue people and animals. each person has a role that they play, but that can be switched during the game if another role would be more helpful. The game can be very intense as the fire continues to burn and flare up as you play.Overall, this game really fits the coop bill perfectly and it's been a hit in our family. I'd recommend it if you enjoy cooperative games and want to pretend you're a fire fighter!",5.0
3067,B0084M8UEE,R1OP3EKUPYCAZ8,Must Have!,"  This game is great.  My 8, 10 & 15 year old really enjoy it.  I've been trying to get them into actual board games (sorry console people, there is value playing games face to face) but it has been a challenge.  This one is a Cooperative game where everyone is working together to save the people from the fire.  Unlike other games that sometimes end with someone upending the game board and walking out of the room, this one sets a positive family game night environment.  Save the victims before the building collapses and too many victims are lost to fire or you lose.  There are variable rules that can be modified to add challenge to the game plus the expansion packs are good for a new look and different challenge.  I highly recommend this game.",5.0
3068,B0084M8UEE,R35SC414IUVW03,4-Alarm Fire,"  This board game is the kind of board game you bring out after everyone is finished killing each other over Risk.This is a co-op board game meaning everyone works together against the game itself to try to rescue victims trapped in a burning building from their fiery fate. The rules are relatively simple for the simple setup and get crazier and more complicated as the intensity increases. Each person gets a turn and at the end of their turn the game takes its turn in the form of a dice roll to expand the fire on the board. It's a lot of fun... as long as all of the pieces are there.I had purchased this a while ago, but because of timing was unable to really play it until recently. I noticed when I opened the box that the dice were missing, which I emailed them and they immediately replaced it at no cost. Upon my first play through I also realized that the damage counters were missing. I haven't emailed them, but it has been some time since I purchased it, so we will see how this flies. I would have given this game five stars, because the gameplay is great, and fun, however two missing pieces to a game can cause a lot of confusion and frustration which may already be high due to other more competitive games.If you like co-op, family friendly games (just don't mention that the poor dog got burned up in the fire) buy this, and enjoy. Only thing to watch out for is missing pieces.",4.0

3070,B00LHJZ1OI,R3A8GVVF6A7O1X,More Like a Distant Cousin of the Original Game But Still Fun,"  Overall my family loved this game, but there are some cons in addition to pros.First, if you're looking for the old-fashioned traditional game of life, this isn't it. Not even close. It's more like a distant cousin than a twin. However, with that being said, it is much easier to play and when your kids are insisting on game night and all you want to do is curl up with a book it is so much easier to use the ATM type money counter that comes with the game than handing out actually fake money for your kids to lose and your vacuum to suck up at a later date.The biggest drawback is that only 4 people can play at a time. I have six kids. Fortunately two of them are three and under and are happy to play ""teams"" with some of the other kids.Bottom line, if you're looking for the game you loved as a child this isn't it. If you're looking for something new and amusing, this is definitely worth the money.",5.0
3071,B00LHJZ1OI,R3SW39OL0G4EM5,Twice as complicated and half as fun as the original,"  This isn't just an electronic version of the same ""Life"" game from years ago.  In addition to making it electronic the game itself is different, but not necessarily better (no stock, auto insurance or life insurance to buy for example, and no wedding gifts or baby gifts etc).Every player gets a card and one calculator-type device gets passed around.  You put your card in it and record whatever money you received or paid during a turn. The device tallies all the money and tells you who won. If you prefer the original ""Life"" game but not the hassle of dealing with paper money on every turn just give every player a calculator and let them tally their individual money totals on their own devices. Then you don't have to pass around one device, you don't have any cards to keep track of, and you can play the original game but ""electronically.""",3.0
3072,B00LHJZ1OI,R1DVCV20J0LTGK,"A fantastic update to a classic game.  In addition to the electronic banking, lots of little changes to make it better.","  We wanted a new Life game because our old one's spinner was terrible.  This one has a FANTASTIC spinner that can't jam, and the new electronic banking is really easy and fun to use.  We were playing the original version once a week so I feel like I can speak from authority here - this one is loads better.  It's really well-designed.Top tip - have the banker hold onto all the credit cards.  It makes no sense to keep giving them back to each player at the end of every turn.It's a really fantastic way to update a game and they've changed so much, making it easy to play and lots of fun.  My kids love it.",5.0
3073,B00LHJZ1OI,R30QILFG8T7RJA,Fun and laughs for the whole family,"  Our family has been playing a much older version of Life for the last few years, so we were looking for an updated game. This was such a step up! We received it super fast (thank you Amazon prime!!), and played it the evening we received it. Our kids are 11 and 13 and they had lots of fun. This version has cards and a card reader instead of paper cash, so my daughter loved being the ‚Äúbanker‚Äù adding and subtracting cash from everyone‚Äôs cards. There is so much interactive opportunities with the ‚Äúaction‚Äù cards, which made the game so much more fun. Some of them have you compare dance moves, try to make each other laugh, list your dream vacation and so much more. This is a longer game- it took us almost an hour to play it, but was full of laughter the entire time. I highly recommend this as a fun family game!",5.0
3074,B00LHJZ1OI,R3N0DLJLHBO4JF,"Didn't think I would like it, but really enjoyed it","  I tend not to like remakes of classic games. I bought this for my nephew for Christmas, per his request. I really didn't think I would like the game. I was pleasantly surprised. We ended up playing it several times and we plan to play it next time we visit. The electronic counter was accurate and the addition of different career options and different housing options was fun. I still won't give up my classic game, but I will certainly play this version again. We could use more babies as we were overloading our cars :)",5.0
3075,B00LHJZ1OI,R1BUDBDJ2OC34J,Still a great game!,"  I wasn‚Äôt sure if I would like this version. We got it due to the banking aspect and my daughter was excited to be the banker and use the cards. The bank cards actually work well, easier than I thought it would be. One change I wasn‚Äôt sure about was the fact that the board isn‚Äôt the same as before. Now instead of landing on something and it‚Äôs always the same there are cards to draw which can change up the game. I am very pleased with this version.",5.0

3077,B00LHJZ1OI,R2914GERPG4BN1,Great Fun and Easy to Learn,"  Much like the classic Game of Life, the object of the game is to collect the most money, property, and overall value by the end of the game.  It is very straightforward and super easy to learn.  The electronic banking makes things go a lot more smoothly and eases up that aspect of the game in comparison to the older versions which use fake dollar bills and can get a bit overwhelming.The game is fun for those young and old and easy to understand.  The only downside that I have against it is that it is a bit TOO straightforward and simplistic.  There really isn't much strategy involved at all, more luck.  It is very a much a game where you take your turn, move your piece, do your part, and repeat.Because of the simplicity and ease of learning, I would say that this game is great for a family game night.",4.0
3078,B00LHJZ1OI,R26OXFOIUM3RX9,Love it! Love it!  Love it!,"  This is by far my favorite childhood board game.  I love the Electronic Banking part, it makes it much harder for people to cheat and keeps the game under control in that regard.  Life is a fun simulated life board game requiring you and your opponents to got through the many different stages of life including going to school, getting married, finding a job, having children, and retiring.  Many obstacle pop up through the game to give you some challanges.  Still one of favorite board games!",5.0

Also all the dollar bills get folded and wrinkled every time you put them away. Also it is easy to learn and easy to use.

3081,B00LHJZ1OI,R1SFMUQW8CDBKQ,Fun and easy to play game for everyone,  I bought this game for nostalgic purposes plus I was curious about the electronic banking.  After a couple games it became very easy to use.  The gameboard is smaller and redesigned and gameplay has been changed as well.  You still have the same styles game pieces and the spinner but none of the other pieces attached to the game board from previous versions.  At least you don't have to keep up with the paper money which is a plus in my opinion.  I still have fun playing this game with family and friends so I believe it's well worth the price.,5.0

Some of them can be overly complicated and time consuming to learn and play. This game, however, is exactly what you want from a social game. It's small and easily transportable. It only takes a few minutes to explain and then only takes 10-15 minutes to play the whole game. It's a strategy game. We played 5-6 times in a row because each time we played we understood the different strategies better and it became WAY more fun. Games are short enough that it's an easy repeat-play game. The game cards are simple and beautifully designed. THIS GAME CAN STAND ON ITS OWN AND DOES NOT REQUIRE PURCHASING ANY ADDITIONAL GAMES OR EXPANSIONS. DOES NOT REQUIRE UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER GAMES IN THE SERIES.",5.0
3167,B00GDI4HX4,R27Y14R7VWBMLT,Great game but could use some changes,  So the point of this game is to be the last man standing. You can lie or tell the truth but regardless you want to be the last one left. The biggest problem I have found with this game is that no one wants to risk challenging someone because if you are wrong you lose a life. And if no one challenges anyone it basically becomes a game of who has the most tokens. So to make it more interesting we give anyone who challenges someone and is correct and extra 3 tokens and immunity to the next coup that happens. This gives people more of an incentive to challenge people,4.0

The quality was cheap and the rulebook had spelling errors - both not serious issues.  However, one of the role cards (Assassin) had notable ink markings on the back which gave its role away, which obviously ruined the game when playing with friends.The game publisher, Indie Boards & Cards, has been helpful with its customer support but ultimately stopped its support when they identified I had a counterfeit copy, which I understand.  They recommended I complain to Amazon, which I will later today.A shame, because I've played Coup many times with my friends (with their copies) and love the game!  Looks like owning my own copy will be a few more phone calls and shipments away.  Hoping I'm not forced to pay for a replacement.",1.0
3169,B00GDI4HX4,R17RE9XVCWPYXV,Coup is good stuff. It's a small and fun game that ...,"  Coup is good stuff. It's a small and fun game that is easy to explain. If you've got a group of four to six people and you're looking for some quick fun this is a great game to go to. It's small enough to carry someplace like a cafe without much hassle, and other than the pile of coins used in the game it doesn't take up that much space on the table. As far as space, every player just needs space for two cards and their stack of coins, and perhaps the small reference sheet to remind them of what each role's powers are. Small package indeed. I have even had a good 30 minutes of fun playing this game with a total of three people. Four or more is certainly the sweet spot however.The rules are easy enough to explain and the rounds are short enough that you can introduce it to newcomers quickly, and even if they are eliminated early it won't be long before a new game begins and they can get back into it. I have found the bluffing in this game to be so enjoyable that people are often looking to play ""one more round,"" which is a sign of a fun game. ""I have the Duke so I'm going to take two coins this turn..."" says a player as you stare at the Duke in your own hand... there's only two in the deck... Can he really have the other? Do you call his bluff or just let him have his two coins for now? Good times. At a price point of under $15 USD this game is hard to pass up. Because it's a bluffing game you'll want to be sure your cards don't get marked. You might want to consider sleeving them. The size is  65x100mm and the Ultrapro sleeves should fit fine.¬†

3170,B00GDI4HX4,R2R1Y38T0SEQ9O,Really fun hidden role game that everyone should try.,"  Coup is a really fun hidden role game where you have multiple characters with different abilities they can do on their turn. Everyone on their turn can either take 1 coin, take 2 coins, use their character ability or throw a coup (given you have the coins needed) which causes another player to reveal 1 of their 2 characters....if both of your characters are revealed you're out of the game.The fun part is that no one else knows what two characters you have so you can use any ability in the game as long as no one calls your bluff. If they do call your bluff and you don't have that character then you lose a 1 of your characters. If you do have that character you reveal them, add them back to the communal deck and get a new card and the accuser loses a character themselves.Game is really fun and at the price it's currently at <$10 there's really no reason not to experience this awesome game.",5.0
3171,B00GDI4HX4,R1PTJ4Y1Y03Y4H,"Easy to play, fun, and gets everyone involved.","  Bought this at the recommendation of my brother and Amazon's seller rankings as a game to help break the ice with my girlfriend's family.The rules look a bit complicated, but it helped to think of the game as a version of rock-paper-scissors that includes lying and bluffing. That is, for every card there is an opposing character that can counteract it, and you can lie about which card you have. If called out, you're ""challenged"" and must reveal the card. If you prove to have that card, then the player who challenged you loses one of their two characters. If you lack the character, you lose one of your characters. The last surviving player wins.Ultimately, the game is simple and fun to play. More important, everyone gets into it, even after a few glasses of wine. The game worked a treat, and we were all talking, laughing, and waiting for the next twist in game play. With the game being so simple, a lot of the entertainment lies in the twists and turns created by bluffs, challenges, and coups.Lot of fun, and each game only takes bout 15 minutes.",5.0

Werewolf

  ).The product/manufacturer descriptions do not describe this game very well.  There are 5 different cards (and 3 copies of each).  Each one gives you a special ability within the game.  You are dealt 2 cards for your hand.  The goal is to force your opponents to turn over (discard) both of their cards.  Each turn you can choose to draw money from the bank or take a special action.  Actions include spending money to force an opponent to discard, stealing money from an opponent and taking extra money from the bank.  Cards can also be used even when it's not your turn to block others from taking certain actions.  However, since all cards are dealt face down, you are free to pretend you have *any* card and can take any action you want.  If someone challenges you, you have to either show that you have the card you claimed or you are forced to turn over a card (discarding it).  If someone challenges you and you were telling the truth, they are the one who has to discard.If you were to exclusively play this game for a long time with the same group of people, it might start to get old.  However, as part of a set of games you play on game night/lunch with coworkers/whatever, you could play this for years.  Beginners can pick it up quickly and it slots nicely into small amounts of free time.The game uses a non-standard card size (65x100mm).  If you want to protect the cards from wear, you can use¬†

I would consider sleeving the cards anyway, since any card that gets scratched or bent will essentially ruin the whole deck.

3173,B00GDI4HX4,RPPCG8SJVRMVC,Great intro to game night,"  Our game nights start with simpler games before we get into complicated stuff like Ticket to Ride or Smallworld.  Coup is a great ""opener"", particularly for people who don't normally play games (you know the type, ""Hey do you play games?""  ""Well I play Monopoly sometimes...""  >:(  )Even though it's dead simple to learn (even non-gamers pick it up quickly) it relies a lot on each player's ability to bluff, and to call bluffs.  The basic mechanic is, 1) you can bluff your way into a better position, 2) anyone can call you out, 3) if you weren't bluffing, the accuser suffers a huge penalty, but if you were bluffing, YOU suffer a huge penalty.  So most of the game is spent with people bluffing their way into a better position, and everyone watching everyone else and paying attention to what the players are claiming they have... add in the ability to cover your tracks, and it makes for quite a lot of intrigue in such a little game.One other reason we use this as an opener is because the play time is relatively short (half an hour would be a longer game), and it's so interesting that by the end it doesn't really matter who wins, so there are almost never hard feelings.  The rules are also bulletproof: veteran gamers know that with independent games you're not guaranteed to have a perfectly functional set of rules, but that's not the case here.The art is also spectacularly good... I usually spend part of each game just looking at the art.We have also played The Resistance (same author) and it's as fun, but more complicated, and less fun art - also a great game, with a similar mechanic, but Coup gets played more.I found out about Coup through word-of-mouth and haven't been disappointed.  You won't be either if you take my word on it.",5.0
3174,B00GDI4HX4,R1FLZUIOYDYNIH,Super fun with the Right Group of People,"  This is a bluffing card game that reminded my family of the game BS but with a faster play time and a dystopian theme.You'll need a few learning curve play-throughs to work through questions and challenges the rule book doesn't clearly address at first. We kept having questions pop up and there was some conflict with word choice we had to address that became confusing for a few turns. (The difference between ""blocking"" an action and calling out a player needed to be clearer for our game)But even the learning games were fun and everyone wanted to play again. The reference cards are essential until you figure everything out, and are handy for quick reference without getting out the rule book.This sort of game relies on the people playing for fun and challenge. If you have a good group, friends and family, then it is a lot of fun. Though a group of strangers wouldn't be nearly as entertaining. Even if you know the other players, it helps to have the right mix of personalities. For example, a person who hates lying or dishonesty, another who is incapable of a lie, and someone who isn't into joking around might not make for a fun game.Otherwise this is a really good time. Quick play and fun dynamics create a fun time between bigger games or even for a few plays. For the price it's definitely worth it.",5.0
3175,B00GDI4HX4,RTRDRE8I6JH1Y,Inconsistent color on back of cards,"  I had played and enjoyed Coup before and thought I'd like to get my own copy and try Reformation. I bought my first copies of Coup and Reformation and the back of the cards were the same color; not even the slightest difference in shade could be seen. I ended up gifting these first copies to a friend and then decided to buy Coup and Reformation a second time to keep.I had seen reviews and posts online talking of this issue dating to since Reformation released, and I'm disappointed to discover it firsthand and that this issue has persisted for this long. For those with keen eyes, the Coup set is light gray with a slight green hue and the Reformation set is simply light gray. I have seen others online say they made contact with Indie Boards and Cards about the issue, and sadly their regular response was that these slight color differences are to be expected on different release runs and that their only recommendation (to avoid spotting the Inquisitor) is to mix the sets thoroughly so other characters from the Reformation set is included, which sounds like a half-baked solution, to be honest. I returned the 2nd copy of Reformation and tried replacing it with a 3rd Reformation set. Again, color difference.I am also uncertain if this color inconsistency is because of the Coup set, the Reformation set, or both. With this in mind, I am posting this review on both Coup and Reformation.I'm tempted to return these sets and try again, hoping to get a match like my first set of Coup and Reformation. It is disappointing that Indie would let this problem go on for so long.Come on, Indie. step up and fix this issue.",2.0

On the other hand, one could come to appreciate how the game mechanics tie everything together to give it its bang for the buck.  I was admittedly skeptical at first‚Ä¶‚Äù$12 for fifteen cards and some plastic coins?  What gives?‚Äù Once I actually looked at the rules however and saw just how many actions you could take per turn, I began to see the possibilities both in terms of strategy and bluffing.I have a feeling that this game won‚Äôt appeal to people who don‚Äôt play a lot of Poker, or any card game for that matter that encourages people to bluff when their back is against the wall. ‚ÄúCoup‚Äù works better when you have a lot of people playing, but it can and does function as a two player game just fine.  My suggestion is that if you do end up playing with four or more players, that you secretly remove a card from the deck so as to prevent people from counting cards as they figure out who has who.What appeals to me most is the quick play time, what with the recent changes that have come about in my household.  ‚ÄúCoup‚Äù allows me to flex my brain without committing myself to an hour or two to some heavy abstract strategy game.  It also tests my memory a bit, especially when my opponents use three different character actions in one round without exchanging cards‚Ä¶which was the lie?  Do they know that I caught them?  What actions have I taken again and didn‚Äôt someone use the Duke recently to block foreign aid?  You see where this is going.

If you've ever played Resistance and enjoyed it, then this is definitely a game you should try out. The player count is less than in Resistance (2-6 players) but it definitely moves a lot faster. At first glance it seems like the rules are very complicated, but once you start playing you'll see that there is a nice flow to the game, very easy to catch on to. I even enjoy narrating the game, or even just watching and making predictions when there are more than 6 of us. Its also great that there are so many different strategies to play, and definitely very surprising to see how the game pans out. I was very pleasantly surprised with this one!

Bluffing is the key to the game...you need to have a polka face at all times.  The object of the game is to make your opponents surrender the two cards that each player is dealt....and then you become the winner.  Since your opponents do not know what characters you have been dealt...you can easily (sometimes) dupe them into thinking you are a character that you are not simply by using that polka face.The game is a lot of fun...takes maybe ten minutes a round to play...and you get better with each time you play as you learn to strategize.",5.0
3184,B00GDI4HX4,R31RK8F1KX5UFU,"Fun, Short, Easy, Competitive","  Very fun game. Can be played with a lot of players and each round doesn‚Äôt take long. People may think you need to be good at bluffing, but some of the friends who can‚Äôt lie to save their lives were being very successful and winning several rounds. It‚Äôs also simple to learn game after playing just one round. Maybe 2. My parents struggle with a lot of board games unless they‚Äôre classics, but they understand this one east and enjoyed it. Rounds typically last between 5-15 min depending on how many players. Great game for its price and replay value.",5.0
3185,B00GDI4HX4,RPNU6ECN1N230,One of the few available 6-player travel games that is fun,"  I bought this game to play while traveling with a group of 6 people.  It is really hard to find a game that is compatible with 6 players and can travel well.  While I think the ideal number is 3-4 players, this game worked out really well with the six.  It also did not take up much space in my bag.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it isn't my favorite games genre; however, I have no regrets in buying it.More details:Just a quick overview of the game.  It plays quickly -- over in 15-20 minutes.  It is a game mostly built around bluffing, calling bluffs, and eventually backstabbing (or not depending on how you play).  Each player starts two character cards.  You are out once you lose both cards. The last person standing wins.The interesting aspect is that not only does each card type grant the player a special ability but that the cards are also flipped over.  Since they are hidden from the other players, you can claim to use a power to which you don't have a right.  Every turn a person has the right to challenge you.  If you aren't using a ability granted by your cards, you lose a card.  If the challenger is wrong, he loses a card.  There are also other ways to attack and defend other players using a card's special ability.  They seem pretty balanced.Overall, it is a fast-paced game.  You sort of get an idea how people like to play.  Some bluff, some don't.  You can also see some interesting natural alliances that form between people (one couple also supported each other, the other one did seemed to always attack each other).  And because the games go quickly, you have a chance for revenge.The gameplay is different with 6 players because the reserve deck is much smaller.  Almost all the card types are out, and you can't switch out as well.  So it makes it really hard to bluff and weakens some of the special abilities.  It is still fun though",4.0
3186,B00GDI4HX4,R2XJE4PM5RXBWJ,Great for small gatherings!,"  One of the most straightforward games you can get, yet endlessly fun. The fundamentals of the game can be taught in minutes, but the social dynamic will keep the game interesting indefinitely. There are 6 roles, represented as cards, each with their own unique abilities. Players are dealt cards face down with remaining cards in a pool. From there you must bluff, negotiate, and strategize your way to victory. The game is for up to 6 players, and while I find the more players the better, I have played most of my games with 4 players and it does not lose its complexity.This is not a game that you would dedicate an entire night to, as rounds last anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes, but I have ended up playing for a couple hours occasionally. Great game to introduce to people that do not play board games, to get a game night started, or as a casual game.",5.0
3187,B00GDI4HX4,R2A9LEXCVAFWIH,Good game but can be brutal,"  My family enjoys this game and we have played several times.  It is hard as the adult to play this game with your kids because you have to target people and that can be tricky especially if you have a sensitive kid.  So far everyone has been fine with that but the adults tend to target each other more to keep the peace :) Would be more fun to play with friends who are all adults.  That said my kids really enjoy the game.  We alternate between this, One Night Werewolf and Exploding Kittens.",4.0
3188,B00GDI4HX4,R1UVW59Y1043G5,Not Much Fun for Only Two Players,"  The one and only time I played this game was with one other person. It's downright boring as a two person game. It really just comes down to who can lie better and who actually has the better cards. The rounds are super quick with two people- I'm talking about maybe 5 minutes--probably less. It's not very satisfying or immersive when the two person rounds last so little time. The win doesn't feel quite as sweet.Gameplay reminds me of a more complicated version of BS. Perhaps this makes me a simpleton, but I prefer BS.Maybe with more people it could be fun, but I don't think they should advertise this as a 2-6 player game.",2.0
3189,B00GDI4HX4,R2JCUY9C7QEO72,"Simple, Beginner-Friendly, Yet Complex","  Fun game of deceit with low enough rules so a new player can pick it up, while still having enough to be rewarding to experienced players. There are three copies of each of six roles, and each player is dealt two roles and can use certain powers based on what roles they have, but they can claim to have a role that they don't actually have and -- unless someone calls them on it, which is risky -- they get away with it. The game ends quick enough that even if you get eliminated early, it's really not a long wait (never longer than 10 minutes, if even 5). One small issue with the game is that it's pretty risky to call someone's bluff in general (you lose one of your two lives if you're wrong), but this is integral to the nature of the game. It's not a game with a guaranteed winning strategy either, and sometimes the winner is decided by an arbitrary case of one player killing you instead of another player, leaving that other player to kill him. Overall, the game is addictively fun and requires a good amount of thought to play.",5.0
3190,B00GDI4HX4,R1YZY6HZRUBDEP,A low-investment but high-on-excitement game,"  I LOVE Coup!! I first played it two years ago. It was the last week of uni. The SO were throwing us a campus-wide farewell party of sorts. Most of me mates were drunk, flying, or napping. A bunch of us got together in someone's flat, poured glasses of our preferred drinks, and pulled this out. It only took a few turns to catch up to the others, all of whom had played it plenty before.There's practically no set-up required. There's just enough of bluffing and strategy required to make it fun but not enough to be overly complex. Basically, you won't have to set apart 2-3 hours to play this game. You could play a few rounds and be done in 30 mins or go on for hours. You can play it with just two people but generally, the more the merrier. It also makes way for great banter. All in all, a great game, whether used as an ice-breaker or a bonding exercise.",5.0
3191,B00GDI4HX4,R3BRZZHQXN9U1N,Coup: strike while the iron is hot,"  Actual dialogue from a Coup game:""I'm the Captain. I steal two coins from you.""""No you're not.""""Is that a formal challenge?""""No, I just know you're not the Captain.""""Anyone else going to challenge? Ok, I take your coins.""""You can't.""""Why not?""""I'm also the Captain.""Coup is a bluffing game for 2 to 6 players. At its core, it's a simple matter of acquiring coins and killing all opponents with them. The rules fit on a small card: a few ways to gain coins, a couple of ways to kill, one way to steal coins, and one way to change your hand. You have at most two out of five different roles available face down in your hand, and you spend your game trying to keep your hand hidden and alive.The beauty of Coup is that even though you only have two cards with their attendant powers, you can claim to have any power you want. The only way to stop you from exercising your power is to initiate a high stakes life-and-death challenge. Either the bluffer or the challenger will lose a card in a challenge, so the heart of the game is to deduce the hidden holding of the other players, and not let them get away with the brazen bluffs that will turn the tide in their favor.As in poker, but without complicated considerations of hand strength, the quest to go to the level below your opponent gives this game bottomless depth and replayability. The powers are a carefully balanced Rock Paper Scissors, and allow any initial holding, played well, to win the game. Coup also has built-in escalation mechanisms that avoid cyclical positions and virtually guarantee all games drive to a winner.Fast games can take five to ten minutes. A particularly epic game with many players might take an hour.If there is one possible complaint, it's that multiplayer endgame scenarios can get a little complicated. If the last players' holdings are obvious, it's tempting to try to mentally play out the rest of the game before figuring out which power you need to claim to have a shot at winning. This can slow down the game tremendously. You might want to put paralyzed analyzers on the clock.Even though you can probably make your own Coup out of a deck of cards and some ordinary household items, this is a well-made game. The rule sheets for each player are clear and well organized, the octagonal cardboard coins wear well, and the cards are large and easy to read.This is well worth your gaming dollars in the $15 or even $20 range. Obsessed friends paid $50 for Kickstarter editions. I wouldn't go so far, but it comes out in virtually every boardgaming session these days.",5.0
3192,B00GDI4HX4,RSOTP4Y478689,Meets all check marks for a fun game with a small group,"  We played this game last night with our niece and her hubby visiting from out of state. It was a blast! They had played before. It was our first time. Took a minute for me to pick up the strategy, but was super easy to learn.Games these days usually require a lot of players to have fun. This game, I feel, is best kept at 3-5 players. Six would work too, just might be a bit much in my opinion. The games goes so quickly that it‚Äôs easy to play a lot of them. One might go so far as to say addicting and can‚Äôt stop playing ‚Äújust one more‚Äù. LOL it‚Äôs a different dynamic every time cuz obviously your cards change.Truth be told...when we sat down with them to play...I thought that it was going to be stupid but wanted to be a good sport. hahaIt‚Äôs super fun and I‚Äôm buying one now for myself!

3193,B00GDI4HX4,R1Y1SCRGM56KTH,What A Web We Weave When First We Practice To Deceive.,"  Coup is a crowd-pleaser, there's no denying. This quick, little card game handles 2 to 6 players and can be played in fifteen minutes or less, making it a great addition to game nights. It is best played with five to six playes and it's fairly easy to pick up. It also comes with six handy reference cards to make learning the game even easier.The object of the game is to bluff your way to victory. In a far-flung future where the majority of the population is poor and oppressed, only a select few wield power and wealth. You will draw two cards which you will keep secret from your opponents and you will either use their actions or CLAIM you have other cards instead so you can use their actions. The catch? If someone else challenges you and you can't show you have the character to justify the action you just took, you lose influence. If you DO have the applicable character, the person challenging loses an influence. Losing an influence is defined as you turning over one of your cards face up, thus losing access to one action. If you lose all your influence, meaning both your cards are face up, you're exiled and you lose. Be the last man standing to win.The game consists of 15 character/action cards and a bag of money tokens, as well as the six reference cards cited earlier, making it simple to cart around. Coup was a big hit at my game night, with people liking it a lot or flat-out loving it. It's a great way to practice your poker face, because you'll need a good one to win.",5.0

(Actual game review)","  FIrst off, I didn‚Äôt buy this from amazon so I won‚Äôt get the verified purchase label, but hopefully the picture provided is enough to prove I do own the game. I was lucky enough to find the last one on the shelves at a nearby store.And as the header suggests, I bought this as a joke. It‚Äôs been forever since I last played a game with friends but I assumed this was just a normal monopoly game with a parody reskin. I was surprised when I found out there were actually new rules to play with this edition. Which made the reason I bought the game even funnier now in hind sight. But as I looked over the rules and even did a few mock games with myself playing every player (With additional rules in place since the human element could be present if one person was playing a 2-4 player game) and I was fascinated to find out that the new rules for this edition of Monopoly were very fun.So at the beginning of the game, no players start out with any money and the board has a community fund ANY player can use. And there‚Äôs only a few way money can be put back into the Community Fund. So more so than not, that community fund will be lower than when it started for the entirety of the game. And if the community fund run out, everyone loses. Now each player has ten tokens they will need to put on to projects. First player to put all ten tokens one different projects wins. But first players need to buy the project, or auction it off to other player. Which will most likely draw from the community fund. Then with the edition of the chance card, when can be possible drawn during the players dice rolls, or on eight spaces spread across the board. And a good number of the chance cards will take from the community fund.So at the start of the it is about team work in a sense. All players have to work together to keep community from running out of money. But the end of the game is where I found it gets really interesting. Remember keep in mind I‚Äôve only done mock game with addition rules to compensate for a lack of human elements. But there have been several mock games I‚Äôve played, one player piece with have six properties owned and another player piece with have one or two. In any other monopoly game, the latter play would be destined to lose. But since the goal of Monopoly Socialism is to get rid of ten project token, that‚Äôs no longer the case. Each game, the player piece that would have seemed to be loosing, always seemed to make a come back and run neck in neck for willing. And it‚Äôs all base on the factors that there are limited way you can develop project, the chance cards can shake thing up when it comes to property or token management, and the fact that anyone can draw from the community fund.There are a few things in the rules that aren‚Äôt too clear but I tend to be a ‚Äúrules lawyer‚Äù at times so maybe I just looking too deep between the line, so I won‚Äôt mention when of them bother me so I don‚Äôt color anyone opinion. But if I were to issue one gripe, it would be this. If you notice, in the picture I provided, the stack of money has the five dollar bills on top. This game came with ten $1 dollar bills. And the only reason for that is in the rule booklet, the community fund starts the game with $1848 in it. The year the communist Manifesto was published. Which I get for the reference but for the entirety of the game, the one dollar bills aren‚Äôt used. Ever. No chance card, no pay out, no property; nothing else in this game needs the one dollar bills. So me personally, I tossed the one dollar bills away and chanced the rules that the community chest starts with $1850 in it, out of convenience.Other than that, that is my only gripe about the game until I play with friends of mine. The game length don‚Äôt take nearly as long as opposed to the original monopoly. 1 to 2 hours for my mock sessions.",5.0

The game actually plays faster than regular monopoly as well with less controversy about bad deals made by desperate players. If you love Monopoly, add this to your collection.",5.0

3273,B07VPRNZJB,R11J4YPHBQCLSI,Fun little quirky spoof,"  The game is quite fun, and my friends and I had a blast playing and laughing at the humor on display. Also somewhat easy to get the hang of once you realize that half the ""changes"" are just old Monopoly rules renamed to fit the theme.The only real downside is that this ""party game"" is only for 2-4 players, so your party had better be small to fit everyone at the table. Also, it doesn't come with any organizers, but sender rubber bands and ziplocks can fix that.",4.0
3274,B08412VYKZ,R1OF35V1GU0XNO,"Poorly executed, no replay value for adults.","  This was a highly anticipated game for me, but didn't hit the mark. The premise is quiet simple, you move your ship towards the end goal with as much cargo, and as many people as you can. There are a few strategic things you can do, but the game itself is largely luck-based and the winner won't feel like they did anything to win. The jokes are all very funny if you're a Disney fan, but, a typical four player game goes through all the cards around 3/4 times, so they get old and repetitive. The mechanics of the game are worn out in the first 3rd of the game, and there's nothing interesting on the board to run into.The only value I can see is a good introduction as a middle ground between typical family games and more strategy games for young adults and up - this is what you'd play between monopoly and Catan to get your 12-14 year old child introduced to more complicated games. Too many moving parts for those younger.I really wanted to like it but doubt we'll ever play again.",2.0

I happen to enjoy the nostalgia of the art and theme more than the actual gameplay. If your looking for a massive epic game this isn‚Äôt it. If you want the Disney experience and the funny puns, get it. Unlike other reviews I see replay ability with it. And yes the dice are supposed to look dirty.",4.0
3276,B08412VYKZ,RFHMVCAPAAZYK,Fun and Follows the Ride,"  This was actually very fun.  I bought it because I'm a big Disney fan and Jungle Cruise is one of my favorite rides.  Its a little confusing with so many directions but once you get it down, it's fun.  Basically you have a boat full of passengers and you collect cargo and lose passengers along the ride route and when you get to the end, you count up to see who kept more on the boat.  The cards have the skippers jokes on them.  The game it's self is very high quality.  No cheap  flimsy pieces.  It's a solid game.",4.0
3277,B08412VYKZ,R9G5OCWRJ0V56,Fun and funny entry level strategy game.,"  The game has some very strong elements.  The board is well crafted and sturdy.  The art style and layout is very true to the ride.  The puns and jokes, for fans of the namesake ride, are spot on.  I agree with other reviews that the jokes can get repetetive on multiple playthroughs, but if you've been on the ride more than a few times you've heard them all anyway.  They are charmingly stupid jokes, and it's just fun to roll your eyes and go with it.Set-up is quick but there are quite a few pieces to track.  Gameplay seems more complicated than it really is initially, but once you get the flow you can start to develop something akin to a strategy.  If you are a fan of the awesome Villainous series of games by the same company, this doesn't approach that level of strategy or complexity.  My 7 almost 8 year old started to get the hang of the game after a few turns.Overall a fun little game.  Not something I'll play all the time, but it is one I'll bust out once in a while when I need a stupid laugh or want to experience the silliness of the ride from home.",4.0
3278,B08412VYKZ,R261U3WZGOT2YE,A bit of a disappointment for Ravensberger.,"  I am a Disney fanatic.  And when I heard that Disney was making another film based on a theme park ride, it was a no-brainer ordering this game.  Ravensberger is an excellent company and to date, I have never really been disappointed with anything that they've produced.Many people will say that a game based on some kind of intellectual property is doomed from the start.  I must disagree.  I have purchased Jaws and Jurassic Park, both made by this same company and have been delighted to see the integration of the theme into the game.  It's always refreshing to see how little nuances in the plot of the film make their way into the mechanics of a board game.  And, after reading through the rules and watching the video on youtube, the premise of this game sounded like another home-run.The problem though is that the game mechanics become worn out very quickly and at a certain point, everyone just wants it to end.  The repetition of drawing hazard cards and dealing with them EVERY SINGLE TURN is the idea that brings this game to a screeching stop.  I am very surprised that play testers didn't say the same thing.  It sounded great when I read the rules, but when you actually start to play, it gets old very quickly.The quality of the components are top-notch and I wanted to love this game.  Although I will keep it in my collection, I do so only because of what it is themed after.  I will only be able to use this with nieces and nephews - they won't complain about the repetitive nature of it (I hope!).I still place Ravensberger on a pedestal.  I forgive them for this atrocity.  I gave it two stars because the game components are amazing.  If you are looking for an entertaining game to play with people your own age, don't buy this!",2.0
3279,B08412VYKZ,R2I6VRJ7CDNVG2,Fun game with a disney theme,"  Like many games once everyone knows the rules it is pretty straight forward, you should understand most of the rules after your first play through, if you have any experience with other strategy board games.It is fun with just enough strategy, the passengers that are worth the most points changes each game and is a mystery to the players early and based off of your luck with rolling die helps to lead you in the direction of trying to maintain your passangers on board or if going for sets of cargo makes more sense.Overall I see enough replay value for us to enjoy this for a while, you do go through the jokes after the first game, but they are lightharted and themed to the jungle cruise ride, some of which I have heard in person on the ride.",5.0
3280,B08412VYKZ,R1U829C2YB0HSD,I hope we get more Disney Ride games!,"  My husband and I have friends we love to have game nights with, and while we usually opt for more strategic and in-depth stuff, this is a great game to pass time with. It's very simple to learn, super easy to play, and if your love for Disney is anything like mine, you'll enjoy the jokes on the cards and artwork! It's not a game we will want to whip out every game night, and we may not play it super often, I still feel like it has a space on your board game shelf. I feel like Disney kids could also grasp the concept easily, and would be a great family game.Even if your family isn't Disney obsessed, I still think it's a great game to get introduced into board games. If your a hardcore gaming group looking for something to add, I doubt this game would be for you (if you are a hardcore group, and love Disney, check out Villainous.)Recommended by me!

Really enjoyable for my family, some of whom were previously Skippers. My Skipper family members wonder if the people who worked on the writing in this game are also ‚Äúretired‚Äù Skippers based on style and certain sentiments in the rules. It really seems like the writers knew their stuff about the ride this game is based off of.We also have the Ravensburger Jurassic Park and Jaws games and those are both also really enjoyable. It seems like Ravensburger always does a great job of making games that are unique and vastly different than other games in our collection.If I was told I had to make one change to this game, it would be the same change I‚Äôd make to many of my favorites; I‚Äôd love to be able to play with more than four players without having to do ‚Äúteams‚Äù or having someone sit out until the next round.",5.0

It has the right objective to make it ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like the jungle cruise, and even has classic jungle cruise jokes and puns throughout the game.We felt it was very easy to learn, even for kids. It has a simple mystery aspect like Clue and simple dice rolling/card drafting to avoid the perils of the river. There are different strategies to employ, but really you could just go through the motions and still have a shot at winning. It‚Äôs all the luck of the dice.We thought the materials were very high quality. The dice especially are weighted nicely and even appear like they were found on the Jungle Cruise which is fun!All in all it‚Äôs well worth the price and something we will always enjoy playing when Disney fever sets in.",5.0

I worked at the attraction myself for 17 years so I know most of the jokes, but there were some that even made me laugh having not heard them all. I was disappointed that most of the jokes are repeated at least twice in the deck (and it's a huge deck) when there are so many jokes they could have included from 50 yrs of Jungle Cruises. Still now my whole family wants their own copies but they are sold out everywhere so fast. Get yours if you can.",5.0

Still, I thought it would be a lot harder to explain to my mom who hasn't had any experience with the game or area control games than it turned out to be. We had no problems figuring out how to play, the game loop is very fun, well written rules and the few problems we did have were easily found right away in the rules. The artwork is exactly what you would expect, functional and does the job just like the video game. High quality parts and some nice little details like the ""death"" dice has little red blood splatters on it. We both had so much fun and I can't wait to play it again with more people!

It's just a nice decoration.","  For beauty mainly, but hard to play with, since pieces/checkers don't slide and get stuck on fabric stiches & vinyl triangles, and have no finger groove s hence they are too slippery for hand grip or sliding by finger. The box sides are too low  and dices jump out often.  It looks nice, but for those of you who really want to relax and enjoy playing it will be annoying, as it takes an extra effort and caution to play compared to the simply wood ones.

3421,B085PVZX5C,R2STJN4ONEBQXH,Fun but BE CAREFUL,"  I have very mixed feelings about this game. First, it is REALLY FUN, and my kids and I were laughing really hard playing it. The drone taking off is really a lot of fun and cool to see, and even our little 3 year old who is too young to play was enamored by it and shrieking when it would lift off with little playing pieces inside! Really a lot of fun.That being said, there are 3 caveats to be aware of:1)I don't feel comfortable letting the kids play this alone. The drone comes crashing down sometimes and I want an adult or kid old enough to be able to catch it to avoid hurting anyone / furniture, or crashing so hard it cracks the plastic (a part of the drone siding already popped out, but I was able to push it back into place).2)  I feel like this game won't last very long. The pieces are VERY easily lost, as they end up being flung around the room as you play. Also, the drone lifting off bumps into the ceiling easily (thankfully we have cathedral ceilings in our living and had to move the game over to there, otherwise it would hit and come crashing down fast). It's only a matter of time before the plastic breaks or pieces get lost forever.3) I dove to catch it on the way down after a particular round, and it hurt my finger. Nothing major, didn't hurt more than stubbing your toe on furniture or stepping on a lego- it has a safety to shut the propeller if it detects something in the way, but I was still surprised. I was fine, but one of my kids would have been crying if it happened to them.My daughter actually suggested we try playing it outside next time, which might solve some of the issues- can't do damage to the house and everyone can duck for cover until it crashes into the grass. Wind might make it less fun though. HOWEVER- this was a TON OF FUN TO PLAY, so even with all those caveats, and even considering it might not last more than a few months in my household, I'd still consider it worth playing even for those few times.

The game is for 2-4 players and recommended for children over 8 years old. I played this game with my wife and kids (ages 4 and 15 years old), and they both loved it! The objective is to shoot your aliens üëΩ into the spaceship üöÄ, and once you do, there is a short delay which gives other players the opportunity to knock you out and take your place. Whoever gets their aliens üëΩ on the spaceship first and back home wins the game. The game is a lot of fun and very engaging. FYI: The drone only holds it‚Äôs charge for about 30 minutes, so you will have to recharge at that point. Very easy to assemble too!",5.0
3423,B085PVZX5C,R1SEIKIYZTAO8C,Scary toy with no instructions,"  Our grandson loved this game but tired of it easily, mostly because we tired of it very quickly. We were actually surprised that it didn‚Äôt break into a gazillion pieces after two or three rounds, but other than a bent propeller that was easily bent back into shape, the thing won‚Äôt die. And I wish it would. This is a scary toy. The concept is this: The game board is circular, with an impressively noisy electronic drone in the center, and launch pads evenly spaced around the the edge of the board. Each player, max four players, gets three little magnetized alien play pieces. Each player tries to launch his or her little alien into the drone at the center by flipping ‚Äîor banging‚Äî the launcher mechanism. If the alien lands just right, the magnet activates the drone and it actually lifts off into the air until it hits the ceiling or a cross beam or (if you haven‚Äôt been careful about your surroundings) the blades of a ceiling fan. Full disclosure: The fan in our cathedral ceilinged family room was the cause of the bent propeller. Believe me when I tell you that the drone, once it hits an obstacle, comes crashing down, and if it lands on a human body part, that body part will hurt. Our grandson got the hang of alien launching really fast, so every time it was his turn, the drone took off, then inevitably landed on one of his grandparents. We are just glad it didn‚Äôt land on him. We have no idea how you‚Äù win‚Äù this game, because ours didn‚Äôt come with instructions, and though we followed the instructions on the box to find directions on the manufacturer‚Äôs website, there were none for this game. Frankly, I think only preteens and teens should play this game, wearing full protective gear including goggles.",3.0
3424,B085PVZX5C,R24A400G2C66AP,Really fun game for kids!,"  The game couldn't be any simpler.  Get your Alien into the drone and after a few seconds, if it still remains there, the drone lifts off and you score a point.  The entire game was put together and running in no time and the drone only requires 10 minutes of charging before it is ready to use.  My nephew was even enjoying playing with the game by himself - the novelty of the drone is that appealing!What I wasn't ready for, was the fact that the drone really does have quite a bit of power and it takes off with considerable force toward the ceiling.  It hits the ceiling pretty hard before it comes crashing down, so be ready to get down on your hands and knees trying to find the little alien pieces.  The directions mention that you should make sure you don't play under any light fixtures or fans - that is an important warning because there could potentially be damage to both the fixture and the drone.  It seems that playing the game while it is on the floor in a room with a high ceiling is the optimal positioning.Personally, I would have liked it better if the drone just lifted up a few feet and then landed, but I don't know how feasible that would have been for a kid's board game.  The kids in the family love it though - they don't mind having to keep scrambling for the pieces and they don't mind sitting on the floor to play.Even though it was a hit with the kids, I deducted one star because of the potentially damaging height of the drone's flight.  On the positive side, the drone seems to be constructed fairly well and it survived several crashes already.  I am hoping that it holds up so that my nephew can play with it for a while.So, Kids will love it but be thoughtful about the parents of the recipient  - they may not like the gift that you gave the child!",4.0
3425,B085PVZX5C,R3DNQ1R10GD3PF,A fun game for the whole family. Just make sure its used in an open place,"  This is such a fun game for the kids and adults alike. I had a lot of fun playing this with my nephew. I found that you need to attach the arms at an angle to get them in their slots because if you try to attach them directly, they don't seem to want to lock in. The drone and the other components do seem to be well made.  The only issue that I found is that because the drone does fly pretty high, after a few uses the top propeller cracked.  I used some tape to tape it up and it works just fine now.  I think if they strengthen the propellers a little bit then this issue would be mitigated.  Overall, I'm very happy with this unique drone toy and would I definitely get this again as a gift for someone",4.0
3426,B085PVZX5C,R29DGU37Y9WQGW,Great game,"  ¬†I bought this game for my kids. The game includes a drone, a launch pad, a charger cord for the drone, and magnetic alien pieces. You have to wait a Half hour to charge the drone before you play the game. The drone dies very quickly, So you will have to charge it at least one or two times while playing. During the game you will please a magnetic alien please on each shooter then four players will race to get their alien in the middle of the drone, as soon as the alien hits the middle The magnetic piece will connect to the drone and the drone will shoot off into the air. Drone at least takes one to two minutes to set off, allowing other players try and move your alien out of the way. The drone will hit things in your household if it is in the way, although if you play outside you have a better chance to not hit anything. Overall this game is really fun for the kids. I would recommend buying.",4.0

It's not based on any real strategy or thinking, but more on physical speed and accuracy.  And just plain luck of the draw.  The drone is fun and will certainly be the attention getter for the kids playing.  Now, the one thing your might want to be aware of, is that the drone flies straight up into the air and then falls to the floor.  It can take a beating this way, but make sure you're not playing closer to an expensive vase or a fish tank-basically anything that the drone could potentially fall into.  Pets will certainly be curious as well.  Best to play in an open space devoid of fragile stuff.But for the price, it's definitely a fun little game.",5.0

Of all the things the kids can choose to do, this silly game is their choice 9 times out of 10. When it arrived and I was trying it out at home, my husband said: ""You actually spent money on this?"" Ha haaa yes, and worth every penny. My only beef with it is that it doesn't store well because the four whoopie cushion cords are so unwieldy: I just leave it assembled, wrap the cords around the man figure in the center so they don't tangle, and store it high up on a shelf, keeping the noses and the directions in the box near by.

Four people have to play or else someone needs to double up on one of the four remote whoopie cushions. A light will come on and allows you to hit the button and makes a fart noise.

It's collecting dust and sits on my shelf.  Don't think though it's not because we don't play it or don't try to play it, because we did.  I kept pulling it off the shelf at game nights only to hear my Group of 4-6 players usually moan and groan, but I persisted.  I told them it would be different this time, that we could try a different house rule or online play variation I had read about.  We could get energy faster so the cards actually become usable, and we would remove many of the cards that just had useless effects.With each play, each attempt at changing playstyles on my part to make it fun for others, each time we tried to make it better it  just worsened for us.There is little to no point in every collecting energy and buying cards, the game just doesn't last long enough for that.  One of two things will happen in ever game.  Everyone will roll entirely for claws and go last monster standing, and in games of 4-6 you hardly get a turn or two before people are dropping like flies just from die rolls.  Or instead of claws some or everyone rolls purely for victory points, which can make the game even more boring and someone can win even faster.I just found in the end it wasn't worth even pulling to the table anymore.  Which is sad because, I LOVE the theme, the standees, the power up cards, the funny characters and powers.  I love it all as its individual components, it just doesn't feel like there is a game left over in the end.  You would leave everything in the box and just roll the dice until someone reaches 20 points and play the same game.I want to like it, I want to love it again, I just don't think that will ever happen for me or our Group.

You roll dice like you would in Yahtzee, and you try and either accumulate points or knock the other monsters out.There's strategy, so it's not all dice rolling, but I would say that luck plays a bigger factor than actual skill in this game. But it's not as lopsided in the luck department like in Yahtzee by any means.There are also some cards that you can buy to either help improve your monster, or to help harm other monsters.All in all, it's a fun family game that doesn't take up a lot of time, and even younger kids can enjoy.

A battle of Kaiju over Tokyo. At the start, it's a dice rolling press-your-luck game. Glorified Yahtzee. But what makes this unique is the dynamic of not healing while in Tokyo, the ticking clock of staying in Tokyo, and the cards.What a shame, is that the game is over VERY quickly. And it seems like the cards and income accrual just aren't there before the clock runs out. I would much prefer it to last a little longer. Not using the cards are a shame because those are what makes the game more interesting!Modified rules can help and are likely needed. Such as getting two energy cube (currency) per die. Or double health (""die"" then resurrect with a penalty, like a Street Fighter game).I really do think it needs a second revision to address these issues.But this is coming from the perspective of only playing in two player.

There are two ways to win, either get 20 Victory Points first or be the last monster standing (alive).This is one of our go-to games when friends are over (we enjoy playing games like Dominion, Survive, 7 Wonders, Pandemic, 6 Nimmt, Feast or Famine, etc).A game usually takes us around 30 minutes to play (even with 6 players, though we often play with 3).  We have so much fun, that most times we immediately play it again.We bought the Pandakai power up pack separately, thinking it would add a fun element, but we prefer playing the game in its original form. We do like having Pandakai as an additional monster option, though.It‚Äôs simple enough that 8 year olds and up would have fun playing this game, yet complex enough that it‚Äôs never boring.Our 4 and 6 year olds still play on ‚Äúteams‚Äù with a parent, but they love to roll the dice.We are so happy we bought this game for Christmas (almost 2 months ago).",5.0

3471,B01F46RPS4,R1TT1ZX7ID1TSP,"Great for family game night, beat up your siblings","  Tabletop gaming truly has reached a great renaissance lately, and this is a perfect example of it.  This game is relatively easy to learn, and I'd say the monsters all acting identically is actually a strength because of its simplicity.  This is essentially a king of the hill game, with all the players acting as generic mega-monsters out to crush human civilization.  You're not the only one though, as other horrific B-movie monsters also want to claim Tokyo as their own.  You can either play a dominance strategy, trying to take control of Tokyo and bash all other players to death, or go for more subtle glory through star power (points).  Players that opt for the survival strategy risk getting bashed by each other player, but if they manage to survive, they can bring the pain to all other players simultaneously on their turn!  Players going for victory by points still have to worry about whoever controls Tokyo, or risk them quickly running away with the game.  It's a very interesting kind of ""push your luck"" design that doesn't take long to explain at all, allowing players to get right into bashing each other silly!

It is this quick, simple game action that makes King of Tokyo fast and easy to learn, even for beginners. Special features that make it more challenging than Yahtzee: When you roll Smash, you only smash monsters that are NOT at your location (inside or outside of Tokyo); when you roll Healing (hearts), you only heal if you are Outside of Toyko; and you can only leave Tokyo if you've been dealt damage (but staying in for a full round gets you extra victory points). So do you take the smash and try to last until it's your turn again, or bail out, forcing the smasher to go into Tokyo? Super fun, quick game. My only complaint is that the cardboard score cards use rotating dials that don't stay in place very well, you constantly have to adjust (did I have 6 health or 7?) - otherwise awesome game - great graphics, and super creative special power cards!",5.0

Aggressive, YOLO-style dice rolling. Healing? Who needs stinkin' healing. MOAR ATTACK! Secret alliances. There mom gets in on the action. It's their turn to roll... and surprise surprise, she needs me in the kitchen for something. I come back and amazingly, the kids have rolled exactly what they need. *grumble grumble*I'd knock a star off the rating for making it TOO easy for kids to play... but really, it's not their fault I get outsmarted by my kids.",5.0
3476,B01F46RPS4,R2S7GL6U6KK2LF,Best game ever,"  My new favorite board game. The different ways of winning (killing people, scoring points, using cards to power up and then score points) make for great strategic complexity and replay-ability. My friends and I have a lot of fun playing this and it's became a new favorite board game. The art and names of cards are also quite charming. If I had to nitpick, it feels like combat is a bit too powerful - in maybe 75% of games, the winner wins by killing the other players rather than scoring points. But that could just be our personalities",5.0

My 8 yr old absolutely loves it, and every time he's taken it to school for a class game day he tells me it was the most popular game of the day.  The only time he doesn't take it is when my 10 yr old is faster than him and snags it 1st.  I sometimes wish the different monsters had something to differentiate them instead of just the look of the cardboard play piece, but the formula to keep it really simple is working like a charm, so why change it I guess?  This is like Yatzee but cooler for kids.",5.0

The mechanics are simple enough that my 7 year old nephew could play and have fun, but complex enough that my friends and parents enjoy playing it as well.The only reason it doesn't get 5 out of 5 is that the monsters only represent the players and have no special abilities of their own. Flat River Group eventually noticed this flaw and came out with an expansion that gives all monster uniqueness.That expansion is called POWER UP!, and I recommend getting it at the same time if possible to get the complete experience, but the original is still a fun stand alone game.",4.0

If they can learn Yahtzee rules, they can learn King of Tokyo (and this is even easier than Yahtzee!) Recommended for new players and experienced players alike.

Playing with my 2nd and 3rd grader often, and they can form strategies on their own (stay in Tokyo to get points and risk death, or flee to heal up?).Would recommend this for sure!",5.0

My daughter-in-law enjoyed the game so much that this was the only game she wanted to play so everyone had to play it over and over again. Kind of burned my son's family out from playing it. So don't make that mistake. Don't go over 5 times in a row playing it in a 48 hour period... Great game, but don't go nuts playing it.",5.0
3483,B01F46RPS4,R2EI8E08Q2FV3P,Dice game with solid mechanics,"  Well made and entertaining game. I own a good number of board games and this is probably my second favorite dice game right behind BANG. I like how there are different strategies to win the game but strategies that are too difficult to understand that a first time player wouldn't have a chance to win against a veteran. The best way to win (i.e. try to kill off other monsters, go for power cards, go for victory points) will change depending on what gets rolled and the decisions of other players. My kids (8 and 5) both understand the game play and can play independently, however, the youngest still needs suggestions such as don't just buy a card just because you can. This game plays from 2-6 players but I think 4 is really the sweet spot. When you go more than 4, two spots open up inside Tokyo where your monster takes the most damage and I feel there is less skill involved, you can get thrown into Tokyo almost every round and not be able to heal during your turn. It feels more of a game of survival than planning out your best path to victory. Definitely worth a spot in your collection, especially given the wide age ranges that would enjoy playing it.",4.0

Something we could kick out brains out of gear from playing Catan, Pureto Rico or Ticket to Ride, something with luck involved.  So, we ha heard & reviewed KOT and decided this dice game would do the trick.  We love KOT so we bought the power up expansion thinking we would like extra powers (it sounded good).  However, we didn't like it!  It slowed the game down, there was way to much going on....too many cards for us and we didn't like it slowing the game down to figure out what your vards did, because you had so many. So, KOT is a great game, but not big on the power up.",5.0

After playing this with family and friends many times I can confirm they do work great!  Fun game, made well.  Only minor caution: it comes rolled-up so when first unpack it just reroll the dart board in the opposite direction briefly and will then hang down straight (not curled).  This is necessity because it it's curled somewhat it acts like a spring and although the darts still stick, they may sort of hit twice (bounce briefly) and therefore land a little lower than you intended.  However if the board is straightened, hung flush on a wall and the darts are thrown like you would real darts, they stick where they hit -- excellent fun family game!

It was easy to learn, simple to score, and my 5 year old son actually got a couple of the answers correct as he was half listening while playing with toys in the next room. There was only one clue between both complete games we played that we all agreed had an answer that did not make sense. My only concern, it took about 15 card a game or so to complete each game which means we‚Äôve already used like 1/7 of the cards available. We will have to look for expansion packs in the future.

3633,B07QB98HV7,R18ATD8IZSNWND,"Decent game, poor storage organization","  This game makes for a nice change from regular Monopoly with the game being both team-based and focused on territorial control over pure wealth.Players form even teams and go around the board claiming free tiles, stealing them from other players, or locking them down by cementing control. Team members share money and properties. The game ends once all properties have been claimed and one team has the majority.The game itself goes pretty quickly with properties bouncing back and forth and having spaces that take a player to the nearest unclaimed spot. As players share resources, discussing strategy is important as to stop overextension (as running out of money can start a brutal chain reaction). Out first game stayed rather even to the end, with it ending with a score of 9-7, a llama victory.Where the game really fails is organization. The components include character pieces, dice, a property deck, 2 chance decks, a set of control tokens for each team, and some money (in two denominations, $100 and $500). To hold all this, you're given a basic bankers try for the standard monopoly game. This means besides the money, which only needs two of the slots, nothing fits right. And to further top it off, you can't keep it in the tray as the box is too short to allow the cards to remain upright in the slots, forcing a person to either throw everything together (either in the tray or loose in the box) or have a box that is unable to be closed all the way.",4.0
3634,B07QB98HV7,R1PS9FZW42QWOW,Team Unicorn FTW!,"  ¬†Super cute! You are divided up into teams. Instead of buying properties, it's most titles like ""Most Fluffiest"" to win game.

Fun for young and young at heart!",4.0
3635,B07QB98HV7,R1OPZOVPSW5ZE5,Confusing Game,  Cute and colorful is the only good thing I have to say. This game is pretty confusing. We played 2 times and quit early both times.

3638,B07QB98HV7,RA0Z0AIVB2F2A,Fun enough.,"  It‚Äôs kind of a weird version of monopoly. I mean, I‚Äôm not sure what I expected since it‚Äôs llamas vs unicorns. My daughter wanted it for Christmas so I (I mean Santa) got it for her. The game goes fast so I don‚Äôt feel like I have to pull my hair out trying to finish the game.The game ends when all the ‚Äúproperties‚Äù are bought. But the properties are properties like the original version, they are traits. Traits like ‚ÄúCoolest Room Decor‚Äù or ‚ÄúMost likely to Save the Day‚Äù. So you can ‚Äúbuy‚Äù and collect traits, but that also means you can take traits from other players. Each trait switches hands super fast. At first I didn‚Äôt like it because I kept thinking of them like properties from the original monopoly. But you just have to think of them as traits because that‚Äôs what they are. Think of them as the ‚ÄúMost likely to ...‚Äù from the high school year book. If you aren‚Äôt popular one week you‚Äôre not cool anymore and the next person gets the glory.",4.0
3639,B07QB98HV7,REYPR3NGEJFT3,Fun family game,"  This is a really fun game. I'd say it's best for ages 7+ The were a few things that weren't explained well in the rules, but we were able to decide the rules ourselves and move on with the game.  Compared to original monopoly, game play is faster and more competitive, players are sorted into teams, and there were lots of laughs as chance cards include fun ways to get ahead or bring the opposing team down. We found that if teams aren't even there's a slight advantage to the team with fewer players, as their tokens will pass Go more frequently. I think next time we will modify by using the same number of game pieces per team and having the odd person out choose between the teammates tokens on their turn. Overall we enjoyed the game a lot and will definitely play often.",4.0
3640,B07QB98HV7,R3DP44DJDGE60S,Not Regulation Sized Cheap Representation of Monopoly,"  I was disappointed in this product. It is not regulation sized. The player pieces are cheap plastic, and the 'hotels' are simply cardboard rectangles with pictures of rainbows. This may suffice for children ages 5-10, but certainly not for teens or adults. (Yes, even adults like llamas and unicorns).",3.0

We have played a few times so far. It is easy to learn. Similar, but different to monopoly. Such as you are not buying and then adding houses/hotels. You work with only two values of money versus the multiple in Monopoly. I like how it is simplified so children can be the banker and still keep things moving at a decent pace. Lots of opportunities to incorporate math and reading into play. Encourages team building when you have multiple players. Provides positive attributes and relatable content for purchasing such most huggable or best room decor. My son played, but at five he tired easily and had no interest in finishing.",5.0

3643,B07QB98HV7,R2ZS4EVD754VYJ,Fun Team Version,"  This version of Monopoly is quicker than standard Monopoly and you're divided into teams. The team approach makes it easy for younger kids to get in on the Monopoly fun without having a clear understanding of the game. If they can roll a dice and count, they can play! The rules are a bit different than monopoly and money only comes in 100s and 500s. It is a simplified, but fun, version of Monopoly.",5.0

The game play itself has some of the traditional Monopoly game play (chance, free parking, pass go, go to jail, etc) outside of that the game play is very different than the original, and much lighter (good for younger kids). The only reason I didn't give this game 5 stars is due to some of the rules not being clear (for example, one of the chance cards lets you move any player from the other team to the space you're on and they must follow the rules of that space... but it doesn't say what that looks like for Jail, if you're in jail and call someone to that place are they just visiting or do they go to jail with you?) Just a few little things like that - overall though, we had a lot of fun playing this light game as a family.",4.0

It was very easy for my 5 year old to learn, and it is helping my 7 year old build critical thinking and strengthen her adding skills. The game breaks you up into unicorns vs llamas, and we find it better to do one adult and one child per team. The game board is smaller (8x8 instead of 10x10) and it‚Äôs claims that the game ends when all spots are purchased, so it it a shorter game to keep the littles‚Äô attention.

My main disappointment is on the questions for kids. So many of them revolve around pop culture, specific to TV shows, music, and movies. Really? Why can‚Äôt questions be about more than that, or ask about more recent historical events rather than the name of Hannah Montana‚Äôs third boyfriend. The kids didn‚Äôt enjoy it that much because of that. Admittedly we don‚Äôt watch a lot of TV but even if we did and they knew the answers, it might make me question what they are ‚Äúlearning‚Äù versus what they should be learning. Lots of better games out there to play as a family than this one such as Ticket to Ride or Pandemic. Save your money.",2.0
3664,B00NQQTXNK,RARMHMG9VK1ZI,Meh,"  We're having fun playing as a family, but they've really dumbed-down the questions for this version. My kids (12 & 14) can handle many of the ""adult"" questions, and the kid questions are often ridiculously easy. Also they're often centered around the same thing, like the TV show Glee. Who came up with these questions? Why were they so obsessed with Glee? Why do they think kids watched Glee? It would also be nice if there were more question cards. There are only two small packets (one for kids and one for adults), and we're already seeing the same questions, even though we've only played three times.",3.0
3665,B00NQQTXNK,R34DNIZ55M9USX,A great family-friendly version of Trivial Pursuit,"  I was a huge fan of Trivial Pursuit back in the 80s, when it came out. Both of my boys like trivia, but there was no way we could play the original version. The questions on the kid's side ask current questions about subjects kids would know, while the adult cards ask questions that are similar to the original version of the game. All of the questions have been updated to include recent current events and world records, though.The boys got this for Christmas, and we've played it several times. The kid's questions are easy enough that our six year old has a fair chance of winning, while the adult questions are hard enough to give the kids a good chance.",5.0
3666,B00NQQTXNK,R1LUCXD2ZF86SO,Fun educational but not quick or for all ages,"  Depending on the age group of your family will determine how well you like the game. I dont agree with the game for all ages.  We played over Christmas in teams and the 5 year old was only in charge of  handing out the pie pieces and putting the questions back in the holder. Until she quit from boredom. The 10 and 12 year old team did pretty good with some of the kid questions. The 7 year old was teamed up with 82 year old pop pop and we switched between kid and adult questions each round. I dont think either one of them cared much either way. There was nothing quick about the game if you follow the rules. We changed it up to speed it up. First ditched the board. The team got to choose what color question they needed for their pie when it was their turn.  If you got a yellow, pink, blue etc  question right you got that color pie piece. Each team only got 1 question per turn. The first team to fill up their pie with each different color wins. That still took over an hour 1/2 to play that way.",4.0
3667,B00NQQTXNK,R343HQZJW1PPW5,Family fun,"  My husband and I have six children between 4 and 16. I remember playing Trivial Pursuit with my aunts and uncles growing up but it was a pretty frustrating game for the kids. I thought this ""family edition"" would be fun for everyone and it is ok but I'm not sure how well it will hold up once the novelty wears off.So far, I've played with the media-savvy 11-, 14-, and 16-year olds several times. My 4-year old likes to roll the die for everyone and give the card to whoever's reading the question and put the wedge in if the answer is right so in that regard, it's a win because she feels like she's playing right along with everybody else.The 14- and 16-year old, in particular, are torn between whether they want to do the grownup cards or the kid cards. The 11-year old definitely wants the kid cards even though a lot of them are super easy for him. With my less-media-savvy 10- and 12-year olds, I think the kid cards might be a little more challenging.Even with four or five people playing, the game moves pretty quickly which is a good thing. It usually takes around 30-40 minutes for a full game.Some of the kid questions off the top of my head:* What Leonardo Da Vinci painting is known for its mysterious smile?* Which of the following is not one of Mario's cousins: Luigi, Yoshi, or Wario?* What is the name of Spongebob's pet snail: Larry, Barry, or Gary?* What is the name of the high school on Glee?* Deltoids, Trapezii, and biceps are examples of muscles, bones, or viruses?* An ankylosaurus can be identified by the horns on its head, a club tail, or because it's the size of a chicken?Some of the adult questions:* What investment banker admitted to running the largest Ponzi scheme in history?* What author is responsible for both Jurassic Park and ER?* What Twitter aficionado was married to Demi Moore?* Which famous composer had 20 children? (this was multiple choice but I don't remember the choices)* Katniss Everdeen is the protagonist of what novel?For both the adult and kid cards, I could do with fewer questions about TV and celebrities because that's just not our thing. Overall, though, we're having fun with it.",3.0

3670,B00NQQTXNK,R15X29S3BMQKGY,"Good, but adult cards are too easy.","  This Trivial Pursuit game is modified for sped-up game time and age-appropriate questions, but the adult cards are too easy.On this board, every square adds a pie piece to your game piece, making for a faster game for younger ones with shorter attention spans.This game has two sets of cards‚Äîone for kids and one for adults. My 6-year-old can get less than half of the questions in the kids‚Äô set without help, so I‚Äôd guess that that set is probably best for 8-10-year-olds.  The adult set is maybe best for 10-15-year-olds (just guessing; I don‚Äôt have a lot of kids in that age range in my life). Neither set is great for grown-ups. The grown-up cards  are significantly easier than regular Trivial Pursuit, with a large minority of the questions being true/false or multiple choice questions.I suppose the easier adult cards were also designed for faster gameplay, but if you‚Äôre a fan of Trivial Pursuit who wants your young child to have a chance at winning, it isn‚Äôt going to happen with this game (although, as a dyed-in-the-wool nerd, I did find the pop culture questions challenging‚Äîthere are many kinds of intelligence and keeping up with pop culture is apparently not one of mine üòÇ).  If you want to give your child a shot at winning, I recommend that you buy this version AND an adults-only version of Trivial Pursuit, and use the cards from the adults-only version as your adult cards.  Unfortunately, that makes this a rather expensive game.On the other hand, if you want a game that your tween and younger teen can play together, then this might be the perfect thing.  Or if Trivial Pursuit isn‚Äôt your cup of tea, but it is your child‚Äôs, and you‚Äôd just as soon that the adult cards were easy to get it over with, you may appreciate this game unmodified.",4.0
3671,B00NQQTXNK,R2TUSCHWF2KKVD,AWESOME,"  We have played this game so many times now!  It moves along much better than the original trivial pursuit because you don't eatin control of the board by answering correctly, play moves on whether you're right or wrong.  Makes for a nice time frame.  Modifying the rules to fit what you like works well here also, we have friends who play it a couple different ways.  Our main group ages are 47, 42 and 17-  we mix the cards up so that it just the luck of the draw whether you get a really easy one, or a really hard one.  That makes for lots of laughs.We have also played with age groups ranging from 11 to 50.  It is the most fun when there are adults and kids mixed up.  We tried it with all adults and it just didn't seem to do as well.  But for families with kids/teenagers/young adults/adults, I HIGHLY recommend it!",5.0

3674,B00NQQTXNK,R3TG3KTT0SIJMR,Not the same game.,  They have changed the game play to the point where it's a bit flat.  There's no roll again if you get one right. There's no wedge piece spots.  You get a wedge for answering any question in that category. You aren't allowed to go backwards.  It's just weird.  I guess we could just use The old rules but we would have to alter The board.

As a longtime Trivial Pursuit lover, I have MANY different versions of this loved game.  Recently, my son has wanted to start playing.  Since most of the versions I have are very difficult, he was frustrated by not knowing the info (he's only 9, and I have genus editions).So, I went looking for a TP we could play together.  Enter Family Edition.  The questions for him are hard enough to be challenging for him, but he still knows enough of the answers to level the playing field.  The only down side is that there aren't any new cards to bulk up the set.  We've played it so much we're circling back to questions he's already learned.As gripes go, that's really minimal.

3690,B00NQQTXNK,R3E3YX7CUKGLVJ,Simple and decent version,"  The game is good, but my only complaint is the relatively small number of cards they provide.

The topics you debate are so fun it's easy for anyone to form an argument and immediately see multiple sides to the same argument. My 9-yr-old wants to borrow it to play w/ friends.

3762,B01GSYA4K2,R2D3BJ7K2UBB1B,Really poor production for a great game,"  I'll start by saying that this game is fun and a really good one. However, for the price that I paid for this game the way that it came produced (or should I say NOT produced) was a huge letdown. Most strategy games that I have played look good, are packaged well, and are produced well from the game box, to player pieces, to game board. Terraforming Mars, however, was not made this way.First of all, this is said to be a five player game, yet I only had four actual game boards. In order to play with five people, I literally had to take a game board and color photocopy it onto computer paper. How can a company charge $40+ but not include enough game boards to actually play? Even the game boards that were included (the four I received) are on a thin photo-type paper, not even on cardboard! Secondly, all aspects of the game pieces and cards were shrink-wrapped, and didn't come with enough bags (five total) or rubber bands (none) to keep everything together.",1.0
3763,B01GSYA4K2,R3MEVC72NLX1Q6,Must have game!  Mediocre component quality.  Sub-par box and cardboard insert was destroyed by poor shipping.,"  This is an incredible game with a very cool engine building mechanic that offers tons of choice.  We received it this morning and quickly played it twice.  I, already, cannot imagine my game library without it.  It would rate 5 stars were it not for the component and packaging quality.Online reviews had prepared me for mediocre component quality and poor artwork.  Component quality was as expected yet still mildly disappointing considering the cost of the game.  The board is a lighter weight than that of most games I own and I feel like I must be super careful when unfolding it to keep from accidentally tearing it at the scored spots.  The player boards are printed on a pretty flimsy card stock but nothing that can't be improved with some laminate. The box, however, was sub-par and the clever but cheap cardboard tray inside was destroyed by shipping.While my first impression was that the game board was small and drab, I quickly realized that the board was perfectly sized.  Much of the game is played out on the tableau of cards each player creates in front of themselves and on the player boards that they use to manage resources.  The game board is primarily used to track victory points and the game ending parameters by placing various tiles and player markers on the surface of the planet.  The drab topography of Mars quickly fills with colorful tiles and and player markers and looks very impressive by the end of the game.The only real problem lies with the packaging.  The box is of a lighter quality that most of the games on the market and does not need to be nearly as large as it is.  It is much to large too hold the folded game board securely. They try to account for the small board the larger box with a clever cardboard tray that is cut, scored and folded to hold the board floating in the middle above a center area intended for the other components.  The tray is printed to look like the surface of Mars and would be quite neat were it not printed on such a cheap grade of cardboard that it was destroyed in shipping.  The game board and components are too heavy for the tray and a good shake (like a kid with a Christmas present or a UPS deliveryman) will cause the heavy components to destroy the tray that holds them.Again, I consider the game to be a must own.  I do, however, suspect that I will wish that I had waited for the second edition with improved components and packaging.  When you shell out $60.00 for what essentially amounts to an intellectual property and some cardboard, you should get quality cardboard!",4.0
3764,B01GSYA4K2,R1ZB6ONPD3PNLX,Great game with poor quality components,"  I waited for this game for quite a long time. After playing for the first time, I can say that the experience was worth the wait. I love the theme of the game - taking on the role of a corporation working on different projects in order to make Mars habitable for life.The gameplay is fun and has depth. It's an engine builder, in which you try to up the resources you produce in order to work on projects or plant greenery, etc. I really enjoyed playing the game.I had to dock a star due to the quality of the components. I have a fairly good sized board game collection, and I must say out of all of the games I've purchased, some substantially cheaper than this one, this game has THE worst components. The cards are nearly paper thin and flimsy. I had to sleeve them to be sure that they'd last multiple plays. The paint started flaking off the metallic cubes after ONE playthrough. The player mats could seriously benefit from an overlay. But worse than that is they're also very thin and flimsy. The box itself doesn't seem terribly sturdy. For 50+ dollars, I certainly expect better quality. At minimum, the paint should not be flaking off the cubes. They will probably need to be replaced eventually.Finally, the art direction on the game is a really questionable mishmash of stock photos and art.So while this is a really fun game and I really love the theme, this game could seriously benefit from a second edition with better components and better art. It seems like this game was produced the cheapest way possible. At least this game has really fun gameplay as its saving grace.",4.0
3765,B01GSYA4K2,R2785EXYFRKGXT,"Cooperative competition, well balanced, fun, and highly nuanced game that begs successive replays.","  A superbly designed game that lends itself to a great deal of replay-ability. A lot of people have bemoaned the component quality here, and while I would have appreciated the player mats being a little more robust, it's really a minor quibble with an otherwise well designed game.  This is a collaboratively competitive game, which means all players are working towards a common goal, the terraforming of Mars. However, only one winner will prevail at the end of it. Every player represents a different corporation, and this is where the game really shines. Every corporation has a unique strength that informs the strategies it may best apply towards winning. There is a massive deck of cards representing ""projects"" you can build or events you can fund during your turn, and the ideal is to create a bit of an economic and/or resource ""engine."" However, this is by no means the sole path to victory, there's a tile placement land-game going on here too. The beauty is you don't have to follow any specific path towards victory, and that is what makes a good game to me. Many of my friends have commented that they are already looking forward to playing it again before our current session is even complete. There are so many potential synergies here that it can take a few plays just to start to get the hang of the opportunities at your disposal. I would recommend this without reservation.",5.0

3767,B01GSYA4K2,R3DL6EUBEE3BOI,It is a very refreshing unique theme that keeps you engaged (who doesn‚Äôt want to be apart of making Mars a great place to live),"  Since Terraforming Mars came out it has been extremely popular in the board gaming community. I usually don‚Äôt jump on on the bandwagon of the hottest new board games, but this game is an exception.Pros -The theme: It is a very refreshing unique theme that keeps you engaged  (who doesn‚Äôt want to be apart of making Mars a great place to live).Replayability: This game never plays exactly the same each time you play. Each game you end up playing different cards, plus you have a unique corporation that gives you an advantage in some way. There are also multiple paths to victory. I have played games where I won doing a specific strategy, but then other games I use the same strategy only to be beaten by someone with a completely different strategy.Options: There are many options of what to do with your resources in order to get points, no matter how many resources you end up with there is always something you can do. Some options are clearly better than others (but the better ones cost more, so it balances out). This adds a lot of options to your strategy, you can go for the short game, or be in it for the endgame points.Science: This isn‚Äôt really all that important, but many of the science ideas on the cards are pretty accurate. As a science teacher, this is an added bonus to know that you can play board games and learn some real science!Cons -Materials: The player mats and cards are a little thin, but it isn‚Äôt really a problem for gameplay. I just worry about the lifetime of the components. I actually laminated some player mats to make them more durable. Sleeving the cards could also help protect the cards. Also, the player mats have no way of holding the resource cubes in place so if you are not careful a little bump can mess up your player mat.Rules: Although I think the gameplay is easy to follow once you understand the rules, getting to a full understanding can take a little time (partly because there are so many options). First time I taught this to a new group it took about 30 minutes to fully explain the rules. Make sure to give the rules a good read through before you bring the game to the table. It helped me to watch a few run-through videos online. The game does include some quick help cards which are very useful. This game is definitely best for teens or adults due to its complexity.I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys medium to heavy euro style games and wants a new refreshing theme. Some people say the game can be too mean, but I don‚Äôt think that is the case. Most of the mean actions are optional and only affect other players in minor ways. My wife dislikes any game that can be too confrontational, but she is always willing to play this game with me.",5.0
3768,B01GSYA4K2,R2D1XX226LUW2X,The game itself is enjoyable and I would recommend it; however,"  The game itself is enjoyable and I would recommend it; however, (1) for the price, the components are very cheap. Player mats are nothing but flimsy, glossy paper. During the game someone will eventually bump the table, displacing the tokens on everyone' mat, and (2) The tokens/markers/currency cubes are pretty terrible. You get bronze, silver, and gold cubes that represent 1, 5, and 10 dollars that act as currency and sometimes resource tokens. The cubes themselves are hollow plastic that can easily be dented, especially in the corners. Plus with this currency system, it seems an abnormally  large amount of time is spent exchanging cubes for smaller denominations when making a purchase.Additionally, two of my player mats were warped when I opened the box for the first time badly enough where they don't sit flat on the table and can't be used; I contacted Stronghold games directly and they promptly said they'd send out replacement mats (9/20/17), but nearly two months later I have not received them. There is no insert inside the box, you receive an empty box with bags of the game pieces just thrown into it. I like the game but pretty disappointing quality for the price.Update: Contacted Stronghold Games about the damaged player mats on 9/20/17, sent a second email on 11/25, both times I was told replacements would be sent, but as of 1/31/2018 I still haven't gotten any.",4.0
3769,B01GSYA4K2,RQDSU7GZHZIBT,Amazing game,"  If you're looking for a really deep board game - this should be your next purchase. I had heard good things about the game from a few people, and it had good reviews on board game geek, so I decided to give it a shot.BUILD QUALITYWhen it comes to the quality of the pieces and board, it's a bit of a mixed bag. The board itself is perfectly fine. Can't complain. For the player pieces and the currency pieces, these are actually quite nice! They're little colored cubes - some are translucent, others are a little shiny. I'm actually a fan of the pieces.My biggest complaint with the build quality, however, is the player sheet every player gets. This is where you track your ""production"" and your resources throughout the game. For starters, this sheet is a little confusing. My bigger complaint here, though, is that a portion of this sheet is dedicated to show how much of a given resource you earn every round. To indicate this, you put one of your colored player pieces on the designated number. The problem, though, is that the slightest of bumps on this sheet can slide the pieces around, meaning you can turn your production from a 3 to a 4, which can have a pretty big impact. I would have loved to have seen a physical slider piece, or little slots to hold the pieces.This complaint is not a HUGE deal, but probably my biggest concern with the build quality.INSTRUCTIONSI have to admit, when you first look at the instruction manual, it's pretty overwhelming. There are about 20 very dense pages of instructions to read through which walk through the mechanics of the game. It took myself and 4 other people about 2 hours to digest the instructions. We found ourselves referring to this manual often over the course of the game. The manual isn't the best organized, so answering a specific question about the game can often be trying to find a needle in a haystack. Further, the wording in the manual is often a little bit confusing and tricky to understand.One aspect of the instructions that I like is that they have a ""beginner"" version, which is recommended for the first time you play. Essentially, this gives every player the same ""corporation"", which removes some of the variability but makes it a bit easier to learn the mechanics of the game.MECHANICSThis is where the game really shines. While there is definitely a learning curve to this game, it offers so much variability in the way you play the game. There are numerous way to increase your ""Terraform Rating"" (aka, your score), and these actions you take ultimately progress the game in a super natural way.There is no designated number of turns that this game will last. There's no timer. There's no countdown. Instead, you are progressing towards making Mars into a ""viable planet"" to live on. You do this by increasing temperature of the planet, increasing the number of oceans, and increasing the percentage of Oxygen. The actions you take throughout the game may do any of these 3 things, either directly or indirectly. Sometimes, there are even moments where by increasing the temperature you increase the Oxygen level.Another really interesting aspect is the concept of a ""generation"". A generation is more or less a round of the game. Within each generation, every players takes turns. Each turn consists of up to 2 actions per player. Players continue going in a circle taking their actions until they have no further actions that they want to take, and they ""pass"". Once every player passes, the generation is complete.One dynamic I noticed is that the early generations of the game take quite awhile. People are figuring out their strategy, and are building the economy. However as the game progresses, the generations start to move very quickly and the game's resources start to increase at a must faster rate.Overall, the game probably took at least 2 hours to play.REPLAYABILITYWhat made this game so interesting, was the 2nd time I played. The first time was certainly fun, but was generally learning the mechanics and the basic strategies. For the 2nd time playing, though, we understood the main goals, but more importantly, we used the more advanced corporations. These corporations offer even more variation and customization about how you want to win the game.This type of strategizing is what really sold me on this game.CONCLUSIONUltimately, this game is quite complicated with a hefty instruction manual and a steep learning curve. But with the endless possibilities of how you want to play the game, the level of strategizing really outweighs the upfront cost, making this a really rewarding game to learn and to play.",5.0
3770,B01GSYA4K2,R1DYERARDNC43K,Extremely poor production quality. Possibly Scamazoned,  I have not seen production quality this bad since the Knight Models harry potter miniature game. The cards are barely cards at all. The player boards are just thick paper. All of the plastic cubes are chipped before you even open the bag. Even the punched cardboard tiles are about half as thick as tiles for other games. The box it comes in is thin and easily damaged.

3771,B01GSYA4K2,R17CZL1WR7M3IQ,"This is a great game, but..","  I reviewed this game once before when I only played it twice, and I feel I didn't give it a fair review based on two play-throughs.My two biggest complaints I had then still hold true now after giving this game another few more plays. One thing that did change was my overall opinion of the game.My first complaint which seems to be common amongst other reviewers is the player mats. They're pretty terrible. They're slippery and your resource tokens will easily slide if you're not careful. So, be sure to remember where each are placed throughout the game, because if you accidentally knock it, then you're up the creek. So not only do you need to pay attention to all the other game mechanics and rules, you also need to memorize where your cubes are on the mat.My second complaint is the rule book. The format of it is awful, and isn't very good at teaching you how to play the game. I recommend watching videos how to play in addition to reading the rules. This helped me immensely. Which leads me to my conclusion.I actually really enjoy playing this game now that I have a full grasp of the rules. I'd say it's one of my favorites in my collection. I just hope that Stronghold will address these issues, or at least the player mats if they ever do newer editions. A better written rule book, and player mats that are more like the player boards for Scythe would give this game a solid 5 stars.Because of these two issues I have, I'd say this game is a 4 star rating.",4.0
3772,B01GSYA4K2,R1IVMHEYTUFBZO,"Great theme, okay game","  Great game concept, so-so components.Pros:Real science. The concept behind the game is that each player represents a corporation vying to colonize and control a new colony on Mars. Melt glaciers to make lakes, dump algae in the lakes to promote biodiversity, crash an asteroid in the planet to help warm the surface. Every single card in the game is based on real or near-future science.CUBES! So many cubes. Each player gets little cubes to place on their playmat to track their production of steel, power, metal, and other resources. You also collect metallic cubes to represent money. Don't forgot the cubes to track the overall progress of Mars- you track how many generations (turns) you've been playing, temperature, humidity, and oxygen content in the atmosphere. SO MANY CUBES!There's a great sense of progression in the game. Everyone is always doing something, together or alone. You're mining steel, you're generating electricity, your electricity development creates heat, your heat melts ice, as ice melts you can do more biological projects. There are so many feedback systems, so many ways to progress. It can get easy to forget about the main board where you're supposed to track the progress of the planet, because you're so busy with your own playmat.Mars. I mean it's a game about Mars, with a large 4-piece board to represent the red planet, and a lot of real science about how humans would colonize Mars. The theme is ever-present, and some people are really going to dig that.Cons:Player mats are a real problem. The game would benefit hugely if you could use a free map to toss out all the cubes and track things electronically. The problem is that the playmats are cheap paper. This means it's easy for cubes to shift position due to a bowed sheet, or if you bump a sheet you lose a lot of information with no real way to put it back together. And that's the real core of the game- you do a lot of work on those cheap sheets with some little plastic cubes, making it hard to justify the cost of the package. Another idea would be if they could do a dual-layer cardboard player mat, so there would be individual wells for the dice to sit in and they can't be jostled out of place so easily.Overall:I feel like this game needs a Second Edition. Give me a cheaper map of Mars because you don't really interact with that, but better playmats since that's where you spend all your time. The end goals of the game are also a little weak. At the last minute you have to wager on whether you think you can win certain awards- such as generating the most of certain resources. By the end of the game you probably already know who's winning what, and wagering earlier in the game would mean you'll fall too far behind to keep up with other players. So the end of the game could use a little strengthening.The concept is there. Lots of players have a lot of fun participating in all these systems and pushing cubes around their mat. I also didn't have any problem with the art- a lot of cards have really bad stock photography, where most games coming out today have expensive custom art on every card. The rest of the cards have custom drawing and art which is only so-so. If there were a Second Edition, the game does need a more consistent art style, but that's a minor concern. If you like Mars, if you like science, if you like cubes- give it a try.",4.0

And, agreed it was a great game!We have a lot of games on our shelves and over Christmas this was played nearly a dozen times. What's nice is that it's not easy to figure out what exact steps you need to do to win, that is there are many different ways each person can approach the game and each time we play, the winner has taken  a different approach to how he/she collected Victory Points. It's also nice that it has a beginner version (to help ease you into the game) and a Solo version, which is quite challenging.

It is without a doubt my favorite strategy game to play and it's a game that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any board game enthusiast. Unfortunately, the physical components of this game are well below par for a game that costs north of $40. The box itself has no organization for the board or pieces, it is literally just a box with everything you need to play inside of it. That drawback though is only the beginning (and the first thing you notice when you break into the box).I absolutely love the design choice of using cubes that represent ""one unit"" because the game itself has quite a few resources. Because of that, using cubes for ""one unit"" instead of one type of marker for megabucks and another for plants is extremely efficient. However, board which you use to keep track of all your resources is literally just a piece of cardboard. When someone accidentally knocks the table when they stand up or sit down, all your cubes slide and now you have to remember where everything was supposed to go. There are third party solutions for this (clear plastic covers which have wells for the cubes), but for a game at this price point, I would have appreciated a solution for this in the game itself (even if it meant being $5 more expensive).The game itself can be played over and over again with as much (or more) enjoyment on every sitting. On the game design alone, it is undoubtedly a 5 star product. I just wish the components lived up to the gameplay.",4.0
3775,B01GSYA4K2,R1FC4CCNYU13IY,"Great game!  One of my favorites for solo, and a big hit with my 4 player group.","  Great game with lots of flavor.  I love the artwork and texts on the cards.For example, you can crash Deimos into Mars to raise the temperature, and the flavor text reads ""We didn't really need that moon anyways""  :)The only annoying thing is how easy it is to mess up your trackers on the player boards.  There are some great aftermarket overlays to solve this though.",5.0
3776,B01GSYA4K2,R2TAXSXFTGQVGP,Great game with some production quirks,"  First off, this game is a lot of fun and worth buying. In my mind, it is kind of like a mash up of Settlers of Catan and Twilight Imperium 4.The only gripes I have are with the quality/design of some of the components. The cubes used for resources are plastic with a very thin metallic covering that will most likely come off with time. The marker cubes (same as you'd find in a game like Pandemic) work well, but they are used to mark various resource production levels on the player boards and at least once per game they'll get severely jostled and go everywhere. Good luck remembering where they were after that. There are some other components that appear a little cheaply made, but for $40 this is still a great value considering how great the actual game is. Hopefully the manufacturer invests a little more in quality for the eventual reprint.Also, the prelude expansion is highly recommended to reduce the drudgery of the first few rounds.",4.0
3777,B01GSYA4K2,R2RY3E0QK2CP26,Awesome game of strategy and timing with some small production issues,"  The premise:You are playing a corporation that is assisting to terraform Mars so it can be inhabited by humans. The way you win the game is by being the biggest contributor to the terraforming process (having the highest Terraforming Rating or TR). Your corporation produces steel, titanium, plants, energy and heat to help you accomplish completing projects that contribute to the terraforming of the planet.Pros:- Strategy and timing are essential and luck plays only a small part (based on the cards you are dealt).- There have been several negative reviews of the artwork on the cards but I disagree - I think they were well thought out (for the most part).- The game board that comes with the game provides great artwork as well as milestones and awards you can achieve during the terraforming process.- There are two expansions that add a lot more choices to the projects you undertake (Colonies & Venus Next) and tend to make gameplay more interesting.- There is an expansion called Prelude that gives your corporation two head starts that is well worth the price- There is an expansion - Hellas & Elysium - that are two new game boards with two different locations on Mars that add variety as well as different milestones and awards.Cons:- There is a steep learning curve to this game - especially for new board gamers.- The player mats are NOT well thought out. You use cubes for everything you do and you keep track of your production of steel, titanium, etc. using them. If you bump your player mat, cubes go everywhere so you have to be really careful. To remedy this, there are several homemade player boards out there that contain slots for the production cubes to prevent scattering them when you bump your mat.- There are not near enough cubes provided. We end up using $1 megacredit (currency) cubes to make up the difference. I contacted the company by email and they responded that there are no plans to provide extra cubes as an 'expansion' or in the game itself. I think this is a mistake but I'm glad they at least responded to my email.Summary:Despite the problems with the mats and cubes, this is one of my all-time favorite board games. There are some in-house rules I think are essential. The drafting of project cards is a must and we also deal more corporation cards and Prelude cards to choose from as well.I would give this game 4.5 stars if I could because of the player mats and cubes but this game is an excellent strategy game that will remain in my favorite games list for years to come.",4.0
3778,B01GSYA4K2,ROBCMQPVJR62,popular game for science fanatics,"  First of all, i removed one star automatically because shamefully cheap components. Shame on you publisher and developer for money grab there. Developer is raising a kickstarter to sell you better components for the game, with 3d tiles. Board games a hobby, it goes against the spirit of that to offer poor component quality, no matter how good the game is.  That said, game is somewhat random card game with tile placement. if you could get into mood of terraforming and forget that this is essentially one million cube engine building, you may like it. Rule book is horrible, let me repeat, rule book is horrible. You need to watch Rodney Briant's how to play video to play this game. removed another star. Look at Dune boardgame for a good rulebook with quick start. in essence, i dont recommend unless you have interest in the setting.",3.0
3779,B01GSYA4K2,R35FKNXPSK5BLX,"Unfortunately, no.","  There is a massive learning curve when trying to play this game. In fact, after two attempts at playing it, I still don‚Äôt know if I get it completely. Every action card is different, and each rule just poses more questions about the dynamics of how that card affects other game rules. With such a dense set of rules, answers are hard to come by, and sometimes you and your fellow players may just have to agree on how you want things to be played in order to keep things moving. I‚Äôve only ever played with two players, and man, this game is LONG. You should expect to settle in for about 3.5 hours, maybe longer. There are so many aspects of the game that aren‚Äôt covered in the instructions; for instance, some cards tell you to collect random resources (separate from those on the player cards) on that action card... what are these resources? How do you collect them on the card? We decided to just use the bronze markers or the plant markers and move on. We also ran into issues with how to handle the play phase with only two player. Some cards say you can add a resource as an action. So if the other player keeps passing, then you can keep adding resources to those cards seemingly indefinitely. We eventually decided that each player can only do that once. I bought this and Lords if Waterdeeo at the same time. I actually thought I would like this game much more because I‚Äôm a big science and space nerd, but with how long this game takes, and how much of a big question mark a lot of things are, My partner and I actually passionately prefer Lords of Waterdeep to this game. We get the shudders just thinking about trying to play this game again. For $45 this makes me sad. The box is okay but then there aren‚Äôt even places to hold and organize the many, many, MANY, pieces that are involved in gameplay... you just toss them in some cheap plastic baggies. Lords of Waterdeep has a lovely custom-molded insert that keeps everything nicely organized for gameplay. Anyway, I hope I can re-sell this game. My advice is to find a friend who has this game and try to play with them first before investing - I wish I had done that myself.",3.0
3780,B01GSYA4K2,R12PP5V5JOBI5R,"Game arrived defective, publisher hasnt responded for weeks and after multiple attempts",  My version of this game arrived still sealed and new from the manufacturer.  Brought it out for a game night with a bunch of family and as we are opening it and setting it up we realize we are missing at least half the cards required to play.Multiple attempts to contact the publisher over the course of many weeks went unanswered.  I can only recommend to stay away from a company with such bad customer service and quality control.,1.0
3781,B01GSYA4K2,R2BWEV7G3Q560I,Poor quality but a fun game.  Wouldn't recommend for $50+.,"  I hate to leave a 1 star review, but the component quality for the second print run is still abysmal. Nearly every plastic resource cube is scratched and chipped around the corners. The quality of the card stock for the player mats and cards is the thinnest I have seen. The box is flimsy too. If this was a $20-30 game the components would be okay expect the chipped cubes.  I paid nearly $55 at the time of purchase.I contacted Stronghold games to try to get replacement cubes.  I had planned to keep the game because of the excellent reviews and BGG ranking.  This was their response:""Tim,Thank you for your email.  We are sorry about your disappointment with the cubes.  We do take all of theseconcerns very seriously.The manufacturing process for these cubes, which is a double layered plastic injection mold, is very complex.This process causes some chipping on these cubes, especially around the point where the cubes are ejected fromfrom the cube mold, but also in other places as well.  This is unavoidable in this very new and complex processthat we are using, which are likely the first in the industry to execute production of metallic bonded plasticcubes.We apologize for any disappointment you have with these cubes, but we can't replace them.  The game play,of course, is fantastic, and Terraforming Mars has already received many accolades already (including Top 10 game of all time on Board Game Geek, Dice Tower Award for ""Strategy Game Of The Year"", Meeples Choice Award for ""Game Of The Year"", Kenner Spiel Des Jahres nomination for ""Gamer's Game of the Year"").I am sorry you don't feel the quality of the other parts are good.  We respectfully disagree, as we know that they are.  For instance, the cards are 300gsm black core cards, which are of the highest German quality - which is where they came from - and are the same as all of the cards from games printed at Ludofact Germany, the largest and best printer in the world.We are sorry that this game doesn't meet with your approval for production quality, but we have a fantastic game here for gamers.  I hope you will appreciate the great game play as you explore this amazing game system.""--------The excuse the company uses for the poor plastic cube quality is a joke.  Stronghold is not the first company to produce plastic cubes.  Funny how everyone else can make them correctly.  Not only are the cubes chipped, but as you lay them out the paint flakes off onto the table.Included are photos to show how the cubes looked.  If it were just a few I could accept things, but this is throughout almost all of them.  I matched up a Magic the Gathering card over a Mars card to show the weird cut.  The other photo shows how thin the player mats are.  They are slightly thicker than poster paper.",1.0
3782,B01GSYA4K2,R3KYFQJOV1GJZ8,I will Terraform the heck out of you Mars!,"  This game was given to me on Father's day 2018.... it quickly became my favorite game to play.  At this point, I have probably played Terraforming Mars close to a hundred times.  The sad part is, I don't usually win, but I LOVE to play again and again.  There is a great mix of LUCK (what random cards will I get) and  SKILL (knowing what cards to play and how to utilize them to benefit you the most).  There is such a randomness about this game that it feel FRESH everytime I play it.  It will take 1 or 2 games to fully understand Terraforming Mars - this isn't Connect Four, it is a complex game with many components.As I said, every game is fresh and exciting... depending upon what Corporation you start out with and what bonuses you receive and then you get into what cards will I get in my hand.  You have to learn to filter out cards that may be GREAT, but have a global requirement on them that may not be met for quite some time vs cards you can use now. Do you invest in the future buy purchasing this card, but not getting any benefit from it now... or do you conserve that ""money"" to invest in cards that can be used now and give you a much smaller push.The goal of the game is the have the HIGHEST Terraform Rating at the end of the game and as a group having met all 3 global requirements (Oxygen level, Temperature, and 9 Oceans).  Many activities can help to raise that rating - some card raise it, moving up any of the 3 global requirements, and at the end of the game there is PUSH of Terraform Rating by tallying how many forests and cities you have placed - and by what achievements you purchased earlier in the game.  I've played games that I SWORE I was about to win and then my wife or son would pull out an upset victory as we tallied up Terraforming Points from card bonuses, and achievements that I apparently didn't calculate into my ""master plan to win"".The game is really fun and to top it off... they have made numerous expansions for it.  Each expansion adds new elements to the complexity of the game and a variety of new things to do to help you win (or in my case LOOSE  ;) )How long does it take to play this game?  Well we have played 3 and 4 player games  and most seem to last for 4 - 5 hours.  Time FLIES as you play though.I would recommend sleaving the cards to help preserve them.  I have also noticed that some of the money cubes are loosing their paint - in particular the copper colored ones.  And as you add more and more expansions, the box gets pretty full (but that really isn't a bad problem to have).  The player mats were my biggest complaint...  you track your resources here, but stuff moves way to easily on these boards.  The most recent expansion ""Turmoil"" fixes this problem by giving you new mats that have plastic grid that help to hold your counters - very nice.",5.0
3783,B01GSYA4K2,R3NF4QJXQAYP8F,Great quarantine game!,  We had never played this game before but a friend mentioned they‚Äôd played it and loved it on social media so we thought we‚Äôd give it a try. Not a whole lot else to do in quarantine. Had to watch some YouTube videos to figure it out. Would be easier to learn if you have someone who has played before to show you but we figured it out w the YouTube videos. Our 10 year old plays w us too. It can take literally 3 hours to play though so great for quarantine but not a quick game. I like how there is a beginner ‚Äúmode‚Äù and other ways to start as well.

Now we have regular game nights MORE than once a week... I've created a monster. It is a little complex for people brand new to gaming and requires some trips to the internet for rule clarifications, but this game is FUN. It has the feeling of Axis and Allies in that the first couple of turns can really tell the tale of how the 2+ hour game will turn out, but we haven't reached that point YET. For the price, I've definitely gotten my money worth, which is more than I can say about most of the games I own.",5.0

By that I mean the actual mechanics and gameplay are deep and thoughtful. The components are an embarrassment. There is no box insert, so it's just a bunch of plastic bags sliding around. The component quality is also poor. Many of the punch-outs tore the art despite great care in popping them out. All the components feel cheap and flimsy. Even at $39.99 this game is overpriced for the quality.  A shame that such a great game is hampered by low quality.",3.0
3786,B01GSYA4K2,R17WT00EVV0L5M,"Incredibly well-balanced game in need of a ""premium"" edition.","  As many have already pointed out, the component quality is OK at best. We bought custom 2-layer player boards and a generic parts storage container, and they very much improve the experience.However, I'd still highly recommend it, because after several years, this is the only long (>2 hr) game I've consistently been able to get to the table. What amazes me most is that even among differently-skilled people, it's still rare to achieve a runaway victory. In most cases, the score difference between first and last place has been about 10%, and we've had several cases of winning by one point out of 100 or more. It never developed the ""we'll play, but we already know you'll win"" mentality that many of my other favorites fell into.To me, that's strong evidence of an exceptionally well-balanced game.",4.0

But the rules, the emblems, and how the cards are written are complicated.Every player will need to be fully educated in the rules to really enjoy this game.And it is a fantastic game, but the English rules are overly complicated and have points in the rules that refer to other sections of the rules and make the initial read/play terrible.That said, I managed to teach my parents to play this game and it is fantastic almost like a competitive Sim-City like game and every project has really cool functionality.The base game comes with a mini-expansion ""The Corporate Era"" which has more of the competitive attacking cards. Less to say if you have no clue how to play it might not be good to play with these cards. But the symbol is hard to find if you don't read all the rules.Fantastic game, rule book is hard read, but overall a great 2 hour game.",4.0
3789,B01GSYA4K2,RRPM1GAA5802O,Cool game....crappy quality,"  Game looks great but came damaged. Bought this as a gift for my husband and when he opened it we both got the feeling this game had been previously used and repackaged for sale, despite the fact that it was sold as brand new. Many of the game pieces were chipped on the corners (see picture). Amazon has been doing pretty bad at packaging items for shipment this past year too, as with this and other purchases the box it was shipped in had almost no cushioning to take up the extra space and looks like this resulted in the corner of the game box being damaged. You don‚Äôt expect to buy a gift and get it in a damaged state, especially for the cost.  Other reviews from Amazon say similar things about the quality of the components being subpar.

Prelude expansion is a must have and haven't played a game without it since. The extra board expansion is nice to have but not necessary at first until you've played a couple dozen games and want some variety.

3791,B01GSYA4K2,R2ZAVPOLSFLV9O,Satisfying homage to  Kim Stanley Robinson and a great resource-management board game,"  Easy enough to learn if you are already familiar with other tile/resource type games likes Settlers of Cataan. Clear enough to play. All players, as individual corporations, are working together to terraform Mars, increasing its oxygen, water and surface temperature. They are also competing to see who can make the most profit along the way and who can control the largest share of interests in the planet's wealth. As you place tiles and purchase cards, your resource production increases in one of several areas, such as money, metal, energy production, etc.My 10-year-old and I demoed this game at our local game store and immediately purchased it on Amazon, because the game is so popular our game store had been unable to get new copies for many months.The icing on the cake as that the game celebrates Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars books and for fans of those, this makes it all the more tasty.The mechanics are straight-forward enough and yet there are enough options and decisions to make to keep you thinking.",5.0

First, the quality of the game is exceptional. The board itself is sturdy, produced with bright crisp colors and pleasantly smooth surface. To me this is important because I want my kids to enjoy an artfully finished product with stimulating bright colors that is pleasant to touch. Younger kids are way more in-tuned with their sensory processing and a well made colorful product will make them want to come back and play again and again. Which is the very purpose of the Mathemagical game: learn while having fun, especially now, when so many little kids are forced to sit and learn by the computer screen with so many schools going virtual. This is a hands on math alternative that gives the kids opportunity to get off the screen and learn addition and subtraction while playing.Another plus is that the ""Rules"" page is made with some sort of laminate. Unlike other games, that just print the rules on a thin paper that starts to crinkle and rip, this one will stay neat and intact. The same can be said for the box because it's made very sturdy so I won't be taping corners with a duct tape. This board game is a nice gift and a must have at home in today's virtual learning world.",5.0

Even the box is very heavy duty.A fun and engaging way to practice math! My kiddo really likes this and I like that the game can be made more difficult as we progress with adding and subtracting. Even the dice alone are fun to practice math with.Great way to work some extra math into your day!",5.0

Kids don't even realize they're actually learning because of how it's built right into the game play. My kids love it and ask to play, which is awesome because the more exposure they have to math, the better they'll get at it.My four year old also plays along with us and though we need to help him, it doesn't make the game any less fun for anyone and is giving him an idea of what math is and helping his counting skills.I definitely recommend this game, it's a great, fun way to incorporate math into something your kids will already want to do.

I usually worry about weed-related items being too up their own ass or childish, but this was clearly just made by some chill people who put ""well made, fun to play game"" before ""420 lololol"". I played with 3 other adults, and it was an even split of those who partake and those who don't; Obviously you're going to get more out of this game if you're a fan of the leaf, but no need to trip if you're playing with a mixed crowd.

Love the game so much, but I wish there weren't challenges that involve you calling/texting/posting about the game. That's kind of lame. And for people who don't want to do that, there's no option 2 available so then you have to make it up as you go. The crown is kind of silly, as is the giant joint, but the images are beautiful and the card ideas are wonderful.

3844,B083YL5VCY,RCUNQEF9467MC,An interesting take on a D&D game that could have been more,"  Let's talk about what this game is:-Heavily focused on coaxing roleplay out of players, this is a good introduction to the creative and social sides of D&D-Short and extremely easy to learn, anyone of any age can get into it and have a great time with 10 minutes of set up and 10 minutes of rules explanation-There is a ton of flavor and different cards to encounter so while you'll have pretty much the same experience each time, you won't tell the same story each timeNow let's talk about what this game is not:-Tactically deep or difficult in any way. You pretty much can't lose and every character you make, every item you get and just about every enemy is the same. The names change but the effects do not so a rogue's special move is the same as the bard's, is the same as the fighters and is the same as the wizards. Where is differs is it asks *you* to describe how you use your ability combined with your items to make your attack special.-Truly representative of D&D. The roleplaying game has a lot of facets and a lot of depth and especially a lot of freedom and this game doesn't give a good representation of that. Players might think D&D is all about rolling a single dice and sitting back when in fact it's often the opposite and can be extremely tactically advanced. If you have a group willing to embrace the roleplaying instructions of the game it's close to the story telling aspect of D&D but that's about it.Final thoughts:This would be a great game for kids or adults looking to have a few drinks and really not think too much about the game but instead have a fun time bs'ing some crazy stories and rolling diceIt doesn't hold up to even the D&D adventure games so really if you're looking for something crunchy, turn away. I would have liked to have seen at least some tactical variety and difficulty options thrown in for those looking for some depthI personally am happy to have the game because I know the day will come my friends and I and possibly some new ones that haven't heard of D&D will be around the table, tired from the week and pulling this out will let us have a great time without using any further brain cells that evening",3.0
3845,B083YL5VCY,R3OSBWJ1CRTZ2Q,Easy to pick up and play,"  we received this today and have played 2 games so far.  it's a hoot.  because the rules are simple, you can really ""ham it up"" with the roleplaying which makes it a ton of fun for kids and adults.I'd like to see1- there are only a handful of times the DM choice factors in (like who did the best impersonation of a monster).  I think it would be cool to have some bonuses (like in regular DND) where doing a particularly creative problem solve or special ability could give a +1 or 2. Something to encourage roleplaying and not just ""roll""playing.2- it seems fairly easy.  Both games we had all the treasures early and used them to steamroll encounters on the later map tiles.  Because the encounters (by map tile) can be in any order, they are all basically the same difficulty.  I think there needs to be a scaling up as you get to 3rd and 4th dungeon tile.3- not enough uses for gold.  Both times we had all 20 gold in our hands with nothing to spend it on.",5.0
3846,B083YL5VCY,R3KREHQQOXHICG,"Great fun, whether you are a D&D fan or not. Best family game I've bought in a long while","  I received my copy of the Dungeons & Dragons: Adventure Begins game yesterday and played it with my two sons (ages 13 and 10) tonight.We were laughing almost the entire time. Rib-hurting, hard-to-breath, better-not-be-drinking laughs.  It was the most fun we had with a board game that I can remember off hand.  The only thing that has come close recently are video party games like some of the JackBox Party Games.This is the first truly general audience, family game based on D&D that Wizards of the Coast has put out.It is a great game for kid's birthdays and x-mas. The rules are simple, the components are fun, and you don't have to know anything about D&D or even be a fantasy fan to enjoy it. At the same time it manages to capture a lot of the flavor of D&D. More in the beer & pretzels (or soda and chips), railroady-quest style of D&D.The designers did a good job building in ""role playing"" without having to call it that or even explain what it is. For example, each player selects a backpack card  as part of setting up his or her character. The backpack card list the contents of the backpack that are meant as items to use as ""props"" for using a your characters special ability that depends on improvising a scenario to activate the action. It works very well, my 10 year old used his special action almost every single turn because he loved coming up with crazy actions other than ""I hit it with my sword."" It may not have always been the most tactical choice, but it was fun.Many of the encounter cards involve having to improvise and act out. E.g., a confused sphinx who remembers the answer but not the riddle and the players must come up with a riddle for the answer, or a dance competition, or the party has to work together to come up with a group solution to an issue.  There are also some choose-your-own-adventure type cards where an encounter is explained an you have to choose from several options.  The choose from a selection cards are the only part of the game that doesn't have a high level of replayability. I'm guessing from these kinds of cards and the extra card-slot storage in the box that WotC intends to release expansion card packs for the game.  Personally, I'm thinking that when we come upon a card like this that we already played, we'll have the DM come up with a new description and choice but with the same mechanical effects.The DM role is changed each time the party enters a different room. In all combats and in many non-combat encounters the DM also plays his or her character. The card description and dice dictate how the monster acts. But there are some cards where the DM only presents to the other players, even some where the DM has to choose which character wins the challenge.The game is cooperative, but there are some competitive opportunities from cards. Like the create a riddle card I wrote about above. The DM selects which player's riddle is best. As it is a cooperative game, I suppose the DM could just give the win to whichever player needs the gold or healing the most to help the group's chances, but my boys and I enjoyed the competition and played competitive encounters competitively.The cards have a lot of game and geek references, many of the them are D&D related, but they also reference a lot of other Hasbro games in a way that doesn't ruin the D&D vibe. Very clever actually and provides a selection of references for all ages and properties. It is almost certain that most people will recognize at least some of the in-jokes and Easter eggs, whether referencing Monty Python (It wouldn't be D&D without Monty Python references), Lord of the Rings, My Little Pony, Monopoly, etc.While not a premium game, for the price I thought that the components were of acceptable quality. The design of the game, cards, parts were all well done. Game mechanics were very well done. I can't think of another game that is quite the same as it. It is the first straight board game that felt like D&D to me in a way that the Adventure System boxed sets never did. My kids played the Princes of the Apocolypse board game for one scenario and never wanted to play it again. We already plan to play Adventure Begins again tomorrow.",5.0
3847,B083YL5VCY,RJ44YFJRG4XHR,Super Easy to Learn and Younger Children Can Participate,"  It took about 20 min to thoroughly read the rules and be up and running with the game.  The rules are straightforward, and even though there are pre-determined scenarios on cards, there's plenty of flexibility for open ended problem solving.  Exactly what you'd expect from a role-playing game (rpg) and lots of fun.  Our family played the first game, my husband and I with our four and six year olds.  Once we got the kids set up, rolling dice, defeating monsters, and winning loot, they had a blast.  If you're going to run the game with younger children, it would definitely be helpful to have one of the adults remain the Dungeon Master (DM) throughout the entire game.  Give the kids some helpful suggestions on how to creatively overcome the challenges and give them bonus loot or allow them to do bonus damage against monsters for being really creative on their own.  This is an excellent introduction to the world of Dungeons & Dragons with simple rules and will be sure to provide hours of entertainment for your family or group of friends.",5.0
3848,B083YL5VCY,RW7V9JU0M7EWG,Skeleton of a good game,"  Firstly, as an intro to the concepts and game play of D&D, this game succeeds big. Unfortunately, it is not a good game itself for a number of reasons.-The 4 characters are really one character with four skins; only the occasional monster's ability distinguishes them in any functional way.-There is hardly any challenge whatsoever; the game is practically rigged for the adventure to succeed.-The item cards are seriously lacking in both quantity and variety, while some of the event cards (which at times incorporate a fun charades aspect) are agonizingly juvenile, like the one that asks who can fart on command. I'm trying to get my friends into D&D, but now they think it's about farting. The box says ages 10 ""+"". Big sigh.-The lack of unique level-ups, serious threats, and interesting items makes gold and loot in general much less satisfying than a D&D veteran would expect.A good expansion would include the following:-New adventure tiles and associated challenges.-New, UNIQUE abilities for each character.-Many new and UNIQUE items.-More event-ful event cards. Fewer childish ones.-Blank event or even item cards.-More UNIQUE monster abilities/attacks/effects.-More immersive challenges such as passive ""lair"" effects or lingering consequences for the characters.Overall I love how D&D has been boiled down to a simple board game, but it's too simple! It's very same-y and out of balance. I could not recommend anyone buy this until it is bundled with a ""fixer"" expansion at a reasonable price.",2.0

3890,B008FD8ETS,R3I76KLRXFC9MK,Poor quality game,"  I bought this for my 4 year old son because I remember playing this game as a child.  Unfortunately, they don't make things like they used to.  The quality of this toy is incredibly poor.The game itself is made of a cheap, thin plastic that easily bends when in use.  The Hippos necks get consistently stuck in the ""lunge"" position and you need to stop the game to fix at least one Hippo during each round. In addition, the cheap, plastic marbles get stuck in the Hippos necks so they stop ""eating"" the marbles during the game unless you reach in and try to pry the marbles loose.In order to set up the game you need to take each Hippo off of the bottom of the board and attach it to the top as everything is stored on the underside of the game.  The effort that it takes to set up and store this game properly means that my 4 year old can't play it without my help.  I can't imagine that the game will last much longer with any type of heavy use.",2.0
3891,B008FD8ETS,RLSTAGJA9OY9V,Thoroughly disappointed,"  Was so excited to get this to play with my son, and was thoroughly disappointed by what we received.The product is CHEAP and too light weight. The board moves all over when you play because it doesn't have enough weight to it. Even the marbles are light weight plastic and go flying if you hit the dispensing lever too hard. The inside of the hippos does not have enough slope to make the light weight marble roll all the way through the hippo, so they get stuck up in the neck of the hippo.You have to disassembled the game (remove all of the hippos) to fit it in the box provided which is SO impractical because my son will need to ask me to assemble it anytime he wants to play.I wish I could get my 1980's version of this game back.

You have to make sure they go all the back up, they don't spring fully on their own. If you don't do that it won't lift its head. The necks get jammed. The marbles get stuck.Furthermore, it comes deconstructed so once put together won't fit back in the box.

So it sits awkwardly on top of the rest of my games and sometimes falls over or gets in the way and then I am chasing balls all night. Also, the lever for munching should be more kid proof, it's small and off, not really good for a toddler. The board seems warped and so one hippo usually gets pretty lucky each feeding session. You can just tell they didn't put a lot of TLC into making it. They get stuck as well. The fun was short lived.",2.0
3895,B008FD8ETS,R3EHQWGFBNWW9Q,Necks get stuck and not fun,"  Like others have said after playing a bit the necks get stuck and you can't play. My kids love the game, but don't want to play it now because ""it's broken, they get stuck"". It's to hard for a little one to get the neck back into place. I think when they tried making the packaging more consolidated this was the result. While stored the hippos necks are extended and locked into place to fit on the back of the game board. I hope they go back to the old version.",1.0
3896,B008FD8ETS,R1K29QL7D1E3ED,Took a chance and am glad we did,"  I was EXTREMELY hesitant to buy this after reading even just a handful of reviews, but decided to take a chance since my 5 year-old has wanted this for years after playing it at a friend's. It all went together well, I was expecting it to be flimsier based on what I read, so was actually pleasantly surprised on its quality. We all played this for an entire evening and then the two kids- 5 and 8- kept playing with it for the rest of the weekend. And they were really rough on it, pounding on the hippos, launching the balls, etc. I finally had to put it away and while that process was more extensive than it should be, it all came apart just fine. I may be one of the few, but I'm really happy with it. Make sure you read the instructions, the necks lock intentionally for storage and if you overfill a ball reservoir you'll get one stuck up in the hippo's neck.",5.0

My husband did see a small piece of  flashing that he trimmed and it seems to be a little better now so if  this happens to you check the quality control and make sure there isn't a piece of plastic blocking the marbles.,3.0
3898,B008FD8ETS,R1F0ETCGERE8CW,Not the old Hungry Hippo I grew up with,"  I was so disappointed when I received this!  This game is much smaller than the one I grew up with -- it's very lightweight and the marbles are the size of tiny peas, not the heavy white marbles included in the 1970s version of this game.  I won't even open the game up -- back it goes to Amazon.  The good news is that I have my old game, but one of the hippos doesn't work very well, but three hippos in the old version is better than four in this ""new"" version.  Rip off!",1.0
3899,B008FD8ETS,R2FG93CPUUQ6MV,Not worth the $7 I paid,  My daughter loves the game but most of the time we're lucky if we can get 2 hippos working at the same time. I thought for only $7 I could tolerate a cheaply made game but this is really bad. I would gladly pay more for a board that actually works.,2.0
3900,B008FD8ETS,R2ZWDQ4PC83JF1,Sad that the craftsmanship is completely unacceptable,  My kids were so excited when we got this and set it up... 2 of the 4 hippos worked great..

Priceless moment went down the drain,1.0
3901,B008FD8ETS,RHZXY4ZBZQW4X,Not like I remember it,"  I remember playing this game as a kid.  I loved it so I bought this to play with my son.  He loves it, but I can't help but be disappointed.  I remembered the game being bigger and sturdy.  This game is flimsy.  The game board seems much smaller than I remember it.  The hippos are cheaply assembled.  When you really get going and start hammering on the lever, it gets caught up and the hippo's head gets stuck out in the middle of the game board.  The whole thing wobbles back and forth.  The marbles aren't even marbles.  They are plastic balls, and there aren't near as many as I remembered.  Although that is probably good because there isn't enough room to collect more than 10 or 12 at a time.It fills the void of not having the game, but I wouldn't mind paying a little more for a more substantial game.",3.0
3902,B008FD8ETS,R2DSR0H8V4Z1K9,Cheap,  I used to have this when I was a child and used to have a blast.  There are no words for the difference in quality.

3903,B008FD8ETS,R683UGT2GZQ04,Breaks within the first few games,"  Do we bought this for christmas for our 2 1/2 year old son with the idea that it will sit in the closet for a few months until he is ready to play. Well he opened it and wanted to play so badly so we thought ""what the heck"" and showed him how to do it. To our surpise he was actually really good at the game and understand the concept. He loves to count the marbles and count ours to see who wins. With that being said we enjoyed playing with him and that all 3 of us could play together. Unfortunately with our multiple games played that day our blue hippo broke that my husband had. Alright well we have 3 hippos and that's all we need right now......until the next morning *today* he wakes up and asks to play Hippos and so we brought it out and starting playing.....until mine the yellow hippo broke and just like that it is now only a 2 players game.....some awesome Christmas present mom and dad!",1.0
3904,B008FD8ETS,RLS9HUHVP16DA,Unbelievably cheaply made,"  Hungry hungry hippos is a fun game, but its cheap, flimsy plastic, every single one of these hippos gets stuck, the handles are hard to push down. It definitely impedes game play when you're constantly having to fiddle with the handles and necks. I just gave this to my 4 year old son for Christmas and he's having fun at the moment, but this thing is junk. I predict it breaking irreparably within a few days. Such a disappointment",2.0
3905,B008FD8ETS,R9E563S5UVFME,Such Fun!,  This toy was the favorite toy of Christmas for our three year old boy.  He played with this thing for hours (literally) and for some reason won every time.  I have no idea how he does this as there is no skill involved - it's just wild slapping as far as I can tell.  If I had one suggestion it would be that there would be more little balls.  Sometimes these things fly everywhere. Eventually we will lose them all.,5.0
3906,B008FD8ETS,R3AT3X15V5E1CG,These Hippos Have Been Hungry For Decades,"  I bought this after seeing it and being hit by a wave of nostalgia, remembering the fun my sister and I had with this game 30 years ago. I wanted my kids to have an opportunity to create a similar fun memory.Back in the 80s/90s, from what I can recall, the game was one unit plus the balls. I dont recall any storage option for the balls, but it's possible that of there was one, it was just destroyed by older siblings before getting passed down to us. Now, each hippo detaches and can reclip to the bottom of the main game square for storage. The balls also have a storage lid that screws to the bottom of the unit. Frankly, as someone who had to problem solve backup options for lost game pieces multiple times, I rather like the change in storage.Oh...and yes...my kids love it!",5.0
3907,B008FD8ETS,RJUYHQ6S3HN3Y,Classic game; terrible box design.,"  Classic game. Is basically impossible to put back in the box. I mean, you can, but it's a pain. You have to remove the hippos, arrange them in a pattern underneath the board, lock their necks in place, and place the marbles in shallow cup that loosely attaches. If you don't get it just right it won't fit in the box and the marbles may fall out. The marbles falling out wouldn't be such a big problem except that the box comes with a cutout where the hippo's mouth is on front of the box. Terrible design, especially if you want the kids to put away the toys themselves. The game itself is a classic and fun.",4.0
3908,B008FD8ETS,R26JB1BIL3EICS,Great but not perfect.,"  I had this game as a kid and couldn‚Äôt wait to play this with it three year old. I had no idea it required some assembly and once it‚Äôs put together it cannot fit back in the box unless it‚Äôs pulled apart again, which is annoying. Also, if you‚Äôre playing with just two players, the balls get stuck in the center of the game. The center has a kind of dip where the balls naturally roll to. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as durable as when I was a kid. But it‚Äôs still a fun game, I just have issues with the design and quality.",3.0
3909,B008FD8ETS,R4P6OEAML86HM,Not made like they used to be.,"  The game itself is a classic and the kids love playing, but this is cheaply made. It wobbles so you are constantly trying to adjust it. Plastic marble? really? As others have said, they constantly get caught in the hippo. We've already had problems with the hippos themselves and have to stop the game to readjust. It wouldn't hurt if the playing surface wasn't so small that you could actually sit at the kitchen table and play instead of on the floor.",2.0
3910,B008FD8ETS,R3MKFAX2XW4W24,Don't make them like they used to,"  Fun game. Kids have loved it, the hippos are already failing after playing it 3 times. The ""reset block"" on one of the hippos has deformed making it very hard to have it function normally. This is due to the cheap mfg process of the game (pretty much all games do this now). We also had one hippo that was borderline defective out of the box, this is the one I use because you have to really give it pressure for it to reset as well. Fun game though, just not going to last very long.",3.0
3911,B008FD8ETS,R2ZKT4DELJYA0X,Dreadful,"  I absolutely dread when my grand children want to play with this game. It is so difficult to work with, put together, and take apart for storage. Two of the Hippos barely worked right when we got it. The marble store on the bottom and the Hippos do too, and they often get stuck. One of the clip things to snap them into place broke on one of the Hippos the first day. I can't wait until they forget about this game and I can throw it out. My grandson asked for it for Christmas, that is the only reason it is still here.",1.0
3912,B008FD8ETS,RCX1ZQOPWVCCT,Love this game! Not the construction,"  Who doesn't love this game?  However, in an effort to make it easier to store (and lets be honest, cheaper to make), the hippos sometimes get jammed as they're meant to unclip and be stored underneath the rectangular game piece.  It works best if played on a smooth, hard surface, but harder on carpet.",3.0
3913,B008FD8ETS,R2ZZ5XJ7JTQJ04,"Pretty cheaply made, no storage box","  You have to disassemble and reassemble the hippos onto the board every time you play but breaking off the plastic attachment clips or clamping it back on. Unless you want to keep it all together but they fall off all the time anyway and it's hard to store since it doesn't fit back into the box fully assembled. No storage for the balls, which are small and definitely a choking hazard.The game itself is just pretty cheaply made, my memory of this game is that it's supposed to stay together and not fall apart when you pick it up.",2.0
3914,B008FD8ETS,R2EZ1FROWT819D,Will take effort to use,"  READ ANY REVIEWS BELOW.  I only saw that it had over 4 stars, but really it should have a warning sticker that it may include hippos that do not work very well.  The name sells it, of course and the pretty bright colors go a long way.  In 30 seconds you will know whether it is a keeper or it is headed to the recycling bin.These days pretty much get what you pay for :)",3.0
3915,B008FD8ETS,R1KE8ETAS0NPB5,"Cheap, plastic junk","  This game really, really stinks. I had Hungry Hippos as a kid and I think it was metal with  real marbles. This is really cheap plastic that's difficult to assemble with plastic marbles. We've played it twice and the orange hippo is struck. His mouth won't open and close. We'd return it, but we got it REALLY cheap on a Prime deal and the kids love the game. I can't believe they don't make the sturdy, long-lasting one anymore.",1.0

3947,B07D5QHKJN,R3364SCBRYLXDT,Disappointed in sample game that was included in kids game.,"  I purchased this game for 5th and 6th grade students to play.  I put the box out and the kids opened it up and began playing.  I did not see that a sample of the game ""Relative Insanity"" was inlaced in the 5 second rule box.  The cards are the same color and look like they could go with 5 second rule.  The sample cards were extremely inappropriate for kids.  This game sample should not be included in a kids game.",1.0
3948,B07D5QHKJN,R1INVKE4KE01JY,Inappropriate for younger children,  The language used on the cards of this game were NOT even close to appropriate for my 10 year old and not even the kind of language I would want to encourage for my 14 year old. ‚ÄòI need a drink‚Äô. ‚ÄòEveryone in her hometown knows what she looks like naked!‚Äô  ‚ÄòI‚Äôd rather pee on an electric fence than wake up next to her‚Äô.

3950,B07D5QHKJN,RU4WWWEXI8ZZA,Needed some modification,"  Whoever invented this game is clearly into sports, especially at a college level. This is not something our family cares about in the least, but I purchased the game on sale, so with some handy Avery Brand labels, I created some questions that were suited to our family interests and would make this game more fun for our group. I'd say if you can purchase the game at a deep discount and have the means to alter the cards for some broader questions, it's well worth your time and great for some laughs, too. I dropped a star for the sports/universities overload, but if that's your thing....add the star back as this would be right up your alley.",4.0
3951,B07D5QHKJN,R36CJKP9IQUSL5,missing an important part.,"  The idea of this game is good, however it is NOT worth it. I bought it for my grandchildren for christmas and when my 12-year-old grandaughter told me she wanted to spend time with me I was stoked. We opened the box and where immediately disappointed when we looked at the timer. THERE WERE NO BALLS IN IT!

And even though this game is pretty difficult for his 5-year-old sister, my son started coming up with categories of his own on her level.  The card might say ""name 3 pro soccer players"" Or ""name 3 sci-fi movies"", but my son decided to put the card down and make up one for his little sister.  He said, ""name 3 Dora the Explorer characters.""  The intense focus on her face and she scrambled to name 3 characters from one of her favorite shows in only 5 seconds... oh, it was just fantastic.  And reading the cards themselves as I play with my 10-year-old is fun too.  Sometimes he comes up with things I figure he'll never be able to think of.

There were many that I never met or did not really know well! ! It was a hit with all the adults and kids! (Family friendly version) The game is very easy to play (especially when the adults had one too many to drink (not the kids!))We made up our own rules:Basically, one person is the judge per round. The judge picks a card from the box of cards and reads it aloud! The person to the judges left is in the hot seat and has to give three answers under five seconds. The game comes with a five second timer that gets turned over immediately after the judge reads the card. The person on his left must answer within the allotted time. If not, the card is returned to the back of the box of cards! However, if the person gives three answers, the timer is turned over again for the next person to give three different answers from the first person. This continues until someone makes a mistakes or has a brain fart and is stomped! When that happens, the card is given to the LAST person who gave the last three different answers from anyone else. The game continues until someone accumulated six cards ! We could not stop laughing!I highly recommend this game if you want to have lots of fun!",5.0

Everyone loved it and had a blast playing. The rules of the game are pretty straightforward. We had kids as young as 9 to adults as old as 60 years old playing. The only con is that we went through the cards pretty quickly because of the number of people playing. I looked on Amazon and there aren't additional ""play card packs"" you can purchase to add to the cards that come with the game.

Both of us listen to tons of conspiracy theory podcasts and we can safely say you will find out something new whenever you play. Honestly, I love that someone took the time to make this game.

My reviews are based on products durability, safety, and how it fosters a child developmentally.I always encourage children to play board games. Board games have the ability to promote so many cognitive, social, and small motor skills, all while having fun.Pros and Noted Drawbacks:- Well made 2 player game.- Age range for this game is 5-10 years (older kids could play as well). I see the younger children needing help with this game.- Instructions/ rules could be difficult for some of the younger player to grasp.- This game focuses on recall, memorization, logical deductive reasoning, pattern recognition,being able to follow multi-step directions.- Game takes about 15-20 minutes to plays as advertised (this may differ depending on the age and skill level of each child).- Very similar game concept to Guess Who and Battleship.- Encourages taking turns, speech-language skills, problem solving.- Fun concept that might make you hungry...Writing reviews has become a hobby for me, and it is always exciting to know that people find my reviews helpful (and if not, why.)

4039,B07G4LWMF3,R2HATI2GRZBB9W,"Simple to learn, difficult to master","  This is a great game.  Think of it as Tic-Tac-Toe x3.  New players can learn the basics very quickly.  The hard part is learning to visualize the possibilities as they develop and to strategize effectively.The most interesting part of this game, IMO, is that there are situations where a block is needed on one player's strategy.  At your turn you need to choose between furthering your own strategy or making a block.  If you don't make the block it falls to the next player (or two).  This can cause some turmoil.  I hope this makes sense!  So, in a 4 player game, if a player puts themselves in a position where they can win at their next turn, the next player can ignore blocking and just play for their own strategy.  If the next person does this as well, it can fall to the last person in line to  do the ""dirty work"", or let the first player win.This aspect of it makes the game very fun, and it's a vital part of the overall strategy.  You can possibly ignore a block and set yourself up to win on your next turn.  Some players embrace this and find it part of the fun - some I've played with find it so frustrating that they don't want to continue playing.  Does the first player in line have a ""moral"" obligation to block the previous player's strategy?  That's why 4 player Tic-Tac-Toe is interesting.Once the board gets crowded it's easy to miss blocks, so someone often wins ""out of the blue"".  This is a quick, fun game that's very easy to pick up and play.  Good quality board and pieces, too.",5.0

The price of this is very reasonable given the quality of the board and pieces.",5.0
4050,B07G4LWMF3,R21IIRLSOXQGSE,New favorite,  This game is an absolute blast. The games go pretty quick so a great way to spend a little bit of down time but fun enough to play for long periods of time. I started with two people and have worked up to 3 which totally changes the game. I haven't ventured to 4 yet. It's such a blast I just bought another for a christmas gift. Highly recommend.,5.0
4051,B07G4LWMF3,R3GJ0SJYTEX9T3,"Wrong contents, won‚Äôt fix it","  I love this game and bought for my mom for Christmas. However, when we opened the box there were 2 sets of blue game pieces instead of 4different colors. Seemed like an easy fix. My mom contacted the company and after 20 or so emails, still refuse to send her the green game pieces. They told her the information she gave them was not enough (even though it‚Äôs exactly the information they required) And continued trying to pay her off by offering other games. Will not trust this company again. Love the game but you can‚Äôt really use it fully when you don‚Äôt have all the pieces. So now I have to hand paint each of the extra pieces so we can play with 4 people.",2.0

My kids came home from school one day and said we had to buy this game that they had played with their teacher.... so we did. Well they obviously played it more than once because it took my wife and I days to beat them. They new all the tricks. It's like tic tac toe but on speed. It's a game within a game within a game.

It's kind of a 3-D, color version of tic-tac-toe which takes a modern twist on a classic. It is fun to play and truly challenges you to use a different part of your brain.

The second game includes all the pieces. I would suggest the pieces be packed flat in one cloth bag or small box that‚Äôs lays on top of board, rather than four small plastic bags that tuck into cardboard sleeves. The sleeves hold the board in place too but the overall box could be smaller and hold the board without the sleeves. That would eliminate waste. Wood rings would eliminate plastic. Even better.",4.0

4067,B07Y94HYBG,R3NYPDK2HPKUGB,The Best Escape Room Game to Take Home!,"  Won't post a picture for Spoiler reasons!As someone who works at an Escape Room business, this was AWESOME! Escape Rooms have been a rapidly growing industry for the last 3 or 4 years, and within the last year, people have begun to ask ""Is there a way to take an Escape Room experience at home?"" And until just a few short months ago, there hasn't really been an ideal option. Escape Room: The Game by Spin Master was a good start, but it just didn't satisfy my Escape Room appetite with just mainly being paper-based ""puzzles"" while entering 4 random plastic keys into a console hoping to hear the uplifting chime indicating that I've entered the correct sequence. At one point I found myself just mashing every single possible combination and not caring about the consequences. Knowing this wasn't working for me, I figured the Escape Room games by ThinkFun and Kosmos weren't going to offer a different experience from what I've already bought.So where does The Werewolf Experiment differ to earn it 5 stars? The creativity and effort that was put into this game. The Werewolf Experiment began as a Kickstarter offer and was going to be on a very limited release to Backers only. It became so popular after it was backed by over two THOUSAND people, earning the creators Juliana and Ariel over a hundred THOUSAND dollars, that Mattel games picked up an offer to mass distribute it!While the pictures on the Kickstarter page are a bit different from what the actual product offers in terms of quality of the game components, ie Plastic locks rather than metal locks, this can easily be ignored simply by the fun factor of the game itself! There were still quite a few paper-based elements, but it still came with more than enough physical items that were all part of the game to make you wonder ""Hmm. How do these 2 things come together to get me a code??"" Every piece included in the game had a purpose, there were no red herrings to throw you off, and it came with a Hint booklet for clues or an Answer booklet if all hope was lost, each booklet having a Table of Contents so you knew exactly what page to turn to. This is way easier to access rather than having to go onto the product website, enter a passphrase that dealt with the scenario, download the PDF Walkthrough, and read it down hoping you don't come across any answers you weren't supposed to read yet.While the box says 2-8 players, I played in a group of 4 and would highly recommend you at least do the same. We ""escaped"" with 13 seconds on the clock.On the original Kickstarter page, one of the pledge goal rewards was the announcement of Escape Room In A Box: The Magician's Spellbook. While there hasn't been an official announcement yet, I cannot wait for the release of the next game! Thank you!!!",5.0
4068,B07Y94HYBG,R2FOZDVU56ANZ2,"Good only for new players, maybe late elementary","  I've got good and bad things to say about this one.First, if you buy all the escape room games, skip this one for yourself. I believe that you are supposed to have 90 minutes per leg of the adventure. My wife and I beat all three legs in 63 minutes total. It was fun, but not very challenging.Good:This does two things that few boxed escape rooms do: it gives a larger group lots of things to do. There are so many games where the box says 1-8 players but where there is one thing to work on at a time and it is small enough that my wife and I can't both see well due to the key info being on a single piece of paper.  The game however, lets you play it so there are three things happening at the same time.This game also has locked boxes which never happens in a boxed escape roomThis feels like an intro to escape room games. But along those lines...Bad:This feels like an intro to escape room games. Too easy (see above) and because it was so easy, I paid $34 for 63 min of fun which is a much higher cost than most. There are detective games out there that give us 12+ hours of fun .Our copy had an error. There is a part where a puzzle has six cubes, all different. We had five different cubes and one sixth duplicate cube. We figured out what the answer was based on context cluesI have some other qualms but they would be spoilers.Overall, look elsewhere unless you want to teach new/young players what an escape room is. My wife and I like the deckscape games, unlock, and exit the game better",2.0
4069,B07Y94HYBG,R29W2FMOIY9IKI,Great for a Beginner and Very Engaging,"  This was my favorite of all the table escape games I have played. The inclusion of a few locks and props just made the game that much more engaging. To an old hand at escape table games and actual escape rooms, this was easier than some of the others I have played but it was also more charming. I played this with my mother and grandmother and we all had an excellent time! We did escape, if you were wondering. This is a great introduction to do this genre so if you haven't played one before or only done a few, this is a nice start. On the other hand, if you are a pro wanting a huge challenge, this might not be your cup of tea. (I still had fun personally but I love puzzles of all kinds.) They need to make another one quickly!",5.0

4071,B07Y94HYBG,R3EMZPNCQGLO3V,... completed this escape room this past weekend and we enjoyed most of the game,"  My family and I completed this escape room this past weekend and we enjoyed most of the game. One of the big reasons I purchased this game was because of the Alexa integrated system.The way I read the description to the game itself was that Alexa would moderate the experience. We have an Echo Show, so I read that as a timer would be displayed along with the sound effects and hints. The skill itself was simply a soundtrack that runs for an hour. We had an issue with that too because after the 5 minutes to get the skill started the track just played with no indication or instruction that it meant the start of the 1 hour. Luckily, we had a timer on a phone to keep track of our real time. Moreover, the effect itself only had indications of 15 minute intervals. I would have expected a countdown or race to the finish indication or something to alert us the time was almost up.We did finish with like 4-6 minutes left, but left the effect on which simply ends with ""Times Up! You lose"" (or something like that).Overall, the game contents themselves and puzzles were very engaging and fun to figure out. My family has completed both at home and professional escape rooms, so we are pretty experienced group by now. We did find this game challenging and engaging enough to be an enjoyable, fun experience. We just found the Alexa skill to be a bit lackluster given what was described, hence the 1-star knockoff.",4.0
4072,B07Y94HYBG,RZVC54JZPVFX7,Great game and was worth every dime,  We loved this game. Did it for my husbands birthday with some friends.

It‚Äôs easier than the werewolf box but still very fun. I gave it 4 stars because it is fairly simple, 2 adults beat it in an hour with no hints. It is advertised as ‚Äú3 games in 1‚Äù. It isn‚Äôt really. All ‚Äú3‚Äù games go together, you can play them in any order, but it is one complete game. I was expecting 3 one hour games. Not 3 20 minute games. That being said, I still really enjoyed the hour spent, all the puzzles were logical and solvable.",4.0
4074,B07Y94HYBG,RCXL6ZCW2KZI2,Great escape experience!,"  I've played all the at home escape games and this one was one of the best. The addition of the physical locks as well as more interactive elements really makes it stand out. The storyline is funny and the tone never gets too dark.As others have said, this game is not ""replayable"". I say that in quotes because you can reset the puzzles and host a party as a game master. Once you play it once, you kind of know the gist of the puzzles. However, the other escape games I've played I have come back to after a year and still had fun playing them again, so just keep that in mind.While one of the puzzles was kind of a letdown, the game overall was tons of fun. It really captured the feeling of a real life escape room. I can see this making a great dinner party/game night!P.S. Be sure to download the soundtrack from the website!",4.0
4075,B07Y94HYBG,RM69E0IJM2HHO,"Fun, engaging and exciting family experience!","  My husband and I had never participated in an escape room before. Our sons, in their 20s, had been to some escape rooms. We played this game last night, and all four of us had a great time.  The puzzles had a nice mix: lots of variety, some easy, some very challenging.  Most of the puzzles truly required collaboration to solve. We did have a few frustrating moments, where it seemed like we were not making any progress, but then there would finally be that ""a-ha"" moment, followed by actual cheering and clapping, when we solved a puzzle or cracked open a lock. It took us 1.5 hours to solve the puzzle and ""escape"" (and that was without using any of the hints - I really wanted to look at some hints, but my sons wouldn't have it!)  My sons gave me credit for purchasing a great game, how cool is that?  Our only quibble is that a couple of the puzzles could use some tweaking, in that the clues were really a bit too vague. But despite that, this made for a wonderful evening of family fun for the day after Thanksgiving. Highly recommended.",5.0
4076,B07Y94HYBG,R1HJ88GAKV7D7N,"One time play, and stupid product packaging","  While the game could have been fun, the fact that they glue the most important part of the game, (the light which is used repeatedly to solve puzzles) is hidden on the top of the box.  The tiny light gizmo is the same color as the box, so is camouflaged perfectly, so as not to see it.  When you take out everything else in the bottom of the box, you naturally nest the box onto the lid, and voila!  You have ensured that you will spend the next 45 minutes in frustration trying to solve a puzzle without a UV  light.  This can't be the first time this has happened.  A simple addition of instructions to make sure you retrieve a part that was stuck onto the lid would seem to be in order.  In addition, this is one time play only.  So after spending 45 minutes (we still solved it, we must be brilliant) of grumbling we finished, and then while cleaning up found the stupid piece, that sealed it... 1 star.",1.0
4077,B07Y94HYBG,R1P9PI75W1W4C4,Not a fun escape room experience,"  We gave up half way through. We do escape rooms ALL the time, but we figured that it should be good that we should save some money before doing our next one. Seemed like a good idea at the time. But half way through, we gave up. Usually when you get a clue, the answer should be like an ""OH"" moment. However, the clues/hint and even answers were super convoluted.This game is also not replayable (obviously), but we had the intention of reusing the bits and pieces to host a escape party as well. However, it's not just sitting in our corner. We're tempted to toss, but also we shouldn't. :/",1.0

4079,B07Y94HYBG,R1TLH806VYR4LG,Best escape room in a box out there,"  No spoilers. This had to have been one of the best at home escape rooms I have played. The way you use everything, and some items you use in multiple ways, was far more creative than any other escape series. My complaint with this game is puzzle P10 we mostly guessed right. *Still no spoilers*. We knew what to do, what to use, and how to do it, and we still had to guess the answer. I‚Äôm an escape room freak, I have done over 20 in person rooms, and I have 10-15 escape room board games with around 30 escapes among those (some board games come with multiple escape rooms in the box). With that many games I have never not figured out a puzzle with the hints, and on P10 we just couldn‚Äôt get it to work without a little guessing (I‚Äôm pretty sure the paper P10 was printed smaller than it should have, we could see how to solve it, it just didn‚Äôt match up right without a little finagling). With that being said, I am going to host an escape room with this game because it was that much fun. This was, by far, my favorite home escape room.",4.0
4080,B07Y94HYBG,R3LA4VZHG1N4HY,Would have been awesome if there was better quality control,"  We were so excited for this game.  My family of 4 with kids 10 and 8 had a fun experience at a real escape room recently but can't keep going because it costs so much!  I thought this would be great substitute, plus we like the idea that we can take our time to really let the kids take part, versus trying to rush to complete in just 1 hr.  I chose this game over others because the story line was more intriguing than most and having locks to open is a huge draw.After playing, we thought the clues/puzzles were just perfect for us newbies/kids.  May not be challenging enough for someone with more experience.  We had a lot of fun trying to figure out the variety of puzzles, some quite clever.  It actually took us over 2 hours, but we were snacking, taking our time, letting the kids participate as much as they could.  There was just the right amount of instruction and I loved that they had a hint book for clues to help us along and a separate book with actual answers in case we were truly stumped.The bad parts, and it's REALLY bad - enough to ruin the game (WARNING: the rest of this review may contain spoilers):The final winning box came UNLOCKED and worse, the combination was set to the correct one.  So it pretty much solved 3 different puzzles right there.Also, an entire puzzle was actually missing, no where to be found.  We were only able to solve that one by looking in the hint book.Lastly, one of the clues that had to be lined up was printed terribly and did not line up properly.I called Mattel to complain because I thought these quality issues were deal breakers and ruined the game.  They actually said the game has been discontinued and likely due to these quality issues. I am satisfied with the steps they took to rectify the situation.That said, if you play this game, remember that all 3 boxes are supposed to be locked.  Lock them if they are not and do not look at the combination!  Once you do that, it would be well worth the $$$ paid versus going to a real escape room.  Even if it is a one-time use (and I feel bad because of the garbage), it is still worth the money for the entertainment value.",3.0
4081,B07Y94HYBG,R27WZIML6YVAM0,Just like the real thing,"  I played this with my 14 and 12 year old kids, and we had a blast. It's remarkable how similar it was to a real escape room, with props, clues, and puzzles, only you're all huddled around a table instead of wandering around a room. The puzzles were challenging (we didn't make it out, even after getting a time extension thanks to one of the puzzles) and played off each other.Age-wise, my 14 year old handled this game no problem. The 12 year old had trouble grasping a few of the puzzles, but others he jumped into and solved by himself. It wasn't necessary to have a ""guide"" - a person who didn't play but read instructions and clues - but it wouldn't hurt either, especially if that guide was someone who had already played through once.If I had to give some recommendations (no spoilers!):- Make a lot of room on a table to play. You'll have clues, notes, trinkets, and pencils scattered all over.- Look everywhere, and I mean everywhere, for objects and clues. We lost at least a good 20 minutes because we missed one puzzle piece inside the box.- All normal escape room tips and tricks apply, which if you've never been in one, means think laterally and creatively! Everything could be a clue, and sometimes the answers to one puzzle can help you solve another.- Definitely not replayable, but if you write in pencil, you can erase and re-use clues and pass the game onto friends or family.I'm going to see if this company makes any more of these games, we had that much fun.",5.0
4082,B07Y94HYBG,R32H4SAYKYDFE4,Great game for people who are like a challenge,"  Great game, played it with a group of six people, everyone had a good time. In this game it's important to pay attention to details. Some of the things I liked about it is that: although it's not an easy one, if you look hard enough and pay attention to clues and details it all make sense in the end, like a well written mystery; as well there are no red herrings in this game, they made it challenging without making it frustrating. 6 out of 6 people I played with said they really liked it, although it took us an hour and 9 minutes to solve it.",5.0
4083,B07Y94HYBG,RHLBCWT66QUZF,One of the best escape rooms for the home,"  This excellent escape game comes with a variety of thoughtful (but solvable!) puzzles, interaction with various included physical objects, and extended play of roughly 90 minutes. It is easily one of the best in-home escape games on the market.  And we've played a lot of them.Knowledge of The Walking Dead is absolutely not required (and will not help solve the puzzles). Fans will likely enjoy some references to the series. But if you don't watch, don't let the branding stop you from buying this game.For those familiar with Mattel's other escape games, this is far and away the best entry. The puzzles are a tad more sophisticated and the general game play features (nonlinear puzzles contributing to the overarching solution) work well here.Our little two-gamer-plus-dog household played through in about 90 minutes with one hint. One puzzle had us stumped for a long time, though. And one drawback is that Mattel uses a hint system that could use an upgrade. Hints are conveniently  assembled one after the other in a handy booklet. This format makes it too easy to accidentally stumble onto a hint you weren't looking for while trying to find the one you need. So be careful in reviewing for hints for unintentional spoilers. Unlike some games, there were not escalating hints either. So if the one and only hint for your puzzle doesn't help you, you'll be stuck. Fortunately, we eventually figured out the one that we struggled with a bit, since the hint didn't help us.It's hard to imagine 8 people playing this game as the box suggests. But the nonlinear game play makes it easier for multiple players to split up tasks and come back together.I highly recommend Mattel's newest entry in the home escape room market. If you're a fan of escape rooms, you should try this...before the zombie apocalypse arrives!",5.0

I‚Äôve done several escape rooms and love puzzles. Many of the things were pretty simple but some had a fun twist that made me have to step in and help more.In the end we literally were down to a minute left as we did the final solve.Because we split into teams and solved different paths and I took time to make copies of any parts that were written on, we can play this again.I feel even if it were only playable once, it was a good value. Cheaper than taking 8 people to an escape room. Honestly cheaper than the gas to drive all of us into the city.Will consider some other products in this line.",4.0

It was perfectly difficult that I was dying to try this version.Bottom line: I found this version to be EASIER than the werewolf version so if you're new to these games, try this one first and the werewolf second.Pros: LOTS of puzzles to get through. It was hard to overlook a clue because so many puzzles walked you through were all the clues were.Con: it didn't take a ton of mental power. I found the puzzles were basic and just time consuming to do (which is just as fun) and the really tough ones I found I did not have to touch because it was easy to see where they led you.For a 90 minute game, we succeeded in 60 minutes.

4086,B07Y94HYBG,R2ONA0CPWEYJDH,Fun and immersive with clever puzzles,"  I used this game as part of an RPG session with some friends, and we had a great time. The use of three dimensional objects and locks helps keep things interesting and immersive, especially as it ties to the backstory. It isn't too difficult, but all the same, our group of gamers in our 20s still needed hints to finish on time. A lack of red herrings and meaningless objects streamlines things a bit. Hints are completely optional, which is nice. The puzzles run the gamut but are organized well; with one or two exceptions, things are pretty clearly labeled, and there are some really clever ideas involved. This feels like a true escape room experience on the cheap, and I highly recommend it. The only real problem is that once it's done, you can't really play it again with the same people. But that's true for any escape room, and it's nice to have an easy and affordable option. I hope the people who designed this one eventually make more.",5.0

We had done a couple of escape rooms before in larger groups, and the puzzles were just as fun as a duo. Took us about an hour and fifteen minutes. (Yep, we were werewolves. Shame.) I think I kept getting hung up on the fortune teller because it showed up too early in the game, but otherwise, the flow was decent. He kept raving about it today, so we are definitely looking for more in the series. I kind of wish this came with a re-packing order for the puzzles so we could lend it out to a coworker's daughters, but the price was decent enough that I didn't feel ripped off. The little plastic locks popped open right at the combo but were sturdy enough that idly spinning it wouldn't ruin it. There was even a little gag that we both laughed at. I will definitely get the other version for the holidays or a family gathering.",5.0

The Echo app, while glitchy (don't tell her you won, or it'll reset your time and you'll have to go another 90 minutes before being able to exit the app!), did add some really great thematic music as well as time checks. You get a winner (or loss) message when the timer runs out.  I usually hate any puzzle with a lock, but these were better varied than simply searching for numbers. The locks also worked well and were not frustrating to open or read the numbers on. The theme was fun and family-friendly, but still intense enough to be fun for adults. The writing is good and has personality (""werewolfery is totes not as awesomesauce as expected"") and you'll care about the characters by the end!  The puzzles, most importantly, were also varied- some were physical, some were mental, some were just riddles, etc. You can reprint the paper components (you WILL write on them!) to do it again or send on to a friend, which I highly recommend. The puzzles were quite challenging. Despite the fact that we are fairly seasoned escape room goers, we DID use all our hints (use EVERYTHING in the box- there may be some surprises!) I do not recommend this for beginners, unless you choose to extend your time limit. Since there is no in-person game master, you are more than free to do so!  We absolutely loved this and will almost definitely buy the rest in the series. We played this during the 2020 lockdown and it made us forget about everything else for 90 minutes. That's a reason enough in itself to recommend it!",5.0
4089,B07Y94HYBG,R6C40WPLTZO2U,Good way to kill an hour.,"  We are fans of escape rooms, so I got this for my family of 5 (18-55) to try.  It was just a sit at the table and figure out puzzles kind of escape room.  We used the alexa app for a timer, which had ""creepy music"" in the background, which added an effect to the game.  The puzzles ran from basic word puzzles on paper, to plastic boxes with combination locks.  (side-note: if you make a copy of the paper puzzles before you begin, you could pass it along to another group to use, as the other items are all reusable and it seems a waste to through it away, or into a recycle bin after one use.Some parts were super easy, but others took a bit. We did use a hint - though Alexa couldn't (or wouldn't) give hints as the instructions alluded to.  The first was a duh-hint as we call things that are too obvious for us.  the second did not really help.  We persevered though and figured it out with 15 minutes to spare.  My husband made a good point that the paper puzzles took some time and with everyone working on pieces it wasn't a collective activity until the end.  It was a good distraction for an hour, but with all the nice quality pieces, it should have come with a second set of paper puzzles so that you could pass it along.",4.0
4090,B07Y94HYBG,R1JUTF1JYN2TXQ,Did not live up to its reviews!,"  Purchased this based on other reviews.  Was let down.  The combination to the last box opened even though I tried the wrong number which ruined the game because it was over at that point when there was really a few more puzzles to solve.  I knew not to expect the same experience as an actual escape room obviously, but expected more than this.",1.0
4091,B07Y94HYBG,R3GHCH3DXINOJN,This exceeded our expectations!,"  Wow! This was great fun. We have done others in a box and real escape rooms, so we have a very good understanding of how they work. We were super impressed at the value for the money. Being able to actually open real locks and have interactions with the pieces (no spoilers here) was great fun! I ordered another one right away as a gift. The other bonus is this game, unlike many, can be repacked and reused. You can even print new papers if needed from their website. A+!",5.0
4092,B07Y94HYBG,R2LJPQC1L54XGH,Not for everyone but fun for the right group,"  This game was very hard. Most players quit before we finished the game. The people that stuck it out thought it was difficult but entertaining. We were missing one of the 3 end clues you put together. We only had 1 & 3 not 2. There was also a part of the game that was inside a cardboard box that we were unaware was there. It was attached to the inside box & I actually thought it wasn‚Äôt supposed to be opened until the end because it was so separate from the rest of the game pieces. It was clues that would have been very helpful during the game. Sooo, if I had all the pieces maybe it would have been a little easier. I wish there had been clearer instructions & something that that showed all the pieces you needed to play. Bummed one piece was completely missing.I would still recommend the game. With the right group of people it could be a really fun game.",3.0
4093,B07Y94HYBG,R3M8S9NSY3GVR6,Great intro to Escape Rooms (perfect for at-home family fun),"  My family and I enjoy a good escape room and home versions like this.  Having done several home versions, I was a little disappointed ... that said, while it was easy it was still fun.  We broke into 2 teams and worked through the clues to come together at the end for the solution.I hesitate to say too much as I don't want to give away the surprise.If you are new to escape rooms or are playing with younger children (10+) this will be great for you.  If you just enjoy an escape room no matter what, you'll appreciate this and its tie back to One Night Werewolf & Doc Gnaw.If you are looking for a long-playing, hard to complete challenge then look elsewhere.Hope this was helpful!",4.0
4094,B07Y94HYBG,R3SA3C8UVFJCK9,"Fun for adults, difficult for kids","  I bought this for my son for Christmas, who LOVES escape rooms. Myself, best friend and 10 year old son pulled it out to play and were confident we‚Äôd escape in time. This game completely stumped us. We played for an hour and didn‚Äôt get halfway through. We put it aside for now and plan to go back to it later. After watching something about it online, we may have been missing pieces that the players in the video had so check the envelopes well. I have to go back and look.We did have fun but I don‚Äôt know how we can possibly get through this game. We should have started with something easier for my son. All in all, it was worth the value, especially since it tells you that you can reprint the puzzles online to play again later.",4.0
4095,B07Y94HYBG,R2YBVE3V65J59U,Fun hour,  This was a great couples gathering. We played on our Friendsgiving with 6 people (30+) and it was pretty intense. It was a little hard to follow because the directions tell you to divide and conquer but it really throws things out of sort in terms of what to do next with each puzzle. I‚Äôd recommend working all together on one puzzle at a time. We finished in just over a hour.Unfortunately you can either only play one time or will have a to print more papers from a link in order to play again.Overall it was a good fun hour for $20.,4.0
4096,B07Y94HYBG,R3IAEMBG0OAS31,"Love Escape Games, this one not so much","  I got this for our family to play. We love games, especially ""escape"" games. But I felt like this one was really scattered and confusing. We loved Dr. Gravely's Retreat, and I thought this would be similar. The Werewolf Experiment has lots of fun puzzles, but instead of all of us working together to solve each one, I felt like we were all working separately. It was like taking a test in a class room at school... everyone quiet and working on their own things. Just wasn't as fun. :/",3.0

I've researched many iMacs on sell here, and besides from the OS, storage and processor, a wireless keyboard and mouse was a deciding factor  for me purchasing this computer. I am very disappointed that the computer I purchased for my daughter for Christmas did not come with a wireless keyboard and mouse. I feel cheated, like anyone would feel after they purchase something online, only to open it up and its not what was advertised.

Well packaged and signature was require upon delivery which is great so that way package won‚Äôt get lost. I downloaded my info from icloud and it was fast and easy. Customer service answers quickly and I know because before buying the imac i was emailing them with some questions and answers were prompt. This is all I can say for now, let me keep using it and we will see. I hope it last a long time because I love it! Dent shown on pic so you could see is nothing major.

4105,B00M4LWXI0,R25Z8ULODBLDH4,Old iMac is Unstable,"  I purchased refurbished iMac on September 1, 2018.  It was late 2013 version sold by Apple Corp. in 2015.  I did not know that at the time of purchasing.  iMac was always slow to start OS.  Very often, it required to reinstall OS.  So, I did numerous times, including erasing the HD with assistance of the Apple Tech Support.  By now (April 26, 2019), the hard drive has filed.  The Square Trade Warranty company marketed as the best i the world were reluctant to register my warranty plan from the beginning, and  today they need my order number from Amazon.  So, being without a computer, I have to go to the Public Library, dig in my Amazon account the order number for Their majesty Square Trade receptionist who is reluctant to do a search by my last name and/or  iMac serial number in their database.  UNBELIEVABLE NEGLECT AND LACK OF SUPPORT.  So, what do I have to do with broken iMac and reluctant warranty company, ""the best in the word""?",1.0
4106,B00M4LWXI0,R2LB1OTA2QB7KU,Everything I needed plus more! Please read full review!,"  I decided to make this purchase 1, because of the amazing low price, and 2 because I needed a streaming computer.and you can see in the image I provided, it also completed my setup as well. The Machine looks pretty much brand spanking new, The reason why I removed 1 star was only because the provided Bluetooth Apple Wireless mouse seemed like it was chewed up by a dog or something, and it doesn't stay connected no matter how much I try. But I have many other mice, so I wasn't worried about that. Also Shipping was delayed but I don't blame the amazon or the 3rd party company for that. UPS has been a terrible experience lately.So back to the review, so far It's been a perfect experience. Of course it doesn't keep up with my main machine but I can't complain for the price. It's truly a Bang for your buck.You get a 2013 iMac at under 500, And not only that it's a Quad-Core 4th gen Intel Core i5. The Intel Iris Integrated Graphics which really can keep up with a heavy GPU load which was impressive and 8GB or ram actually was PLENTY, I thought I was going to need more and was a little sketched out cause Ram is not upgradeable on this Model of the iMac, because initially I was going to get the Radeon RX 570 version for a little more but this does the job more then fine without even throttling or even coming anything above 65C. Thats amazing. Again my main reasoning for this machine was for streaming cause I live stream to twitch and youtube. I can do 1080p @ 60fps No problem without the CPU reaching over 18-42% load in OBS Studio. I have Multiple 1080p Camera's and an AverMedia 4K USB-C Capture Card (using a thunderbolt 2 to to tb3 adapter). Also I forgot to mention I partitioned the Included 1TB drive 50% to Bootcamp Windows 10 which I am doing this on. The windows experience is far much snappier and better on this machine then I expected, and honestly its quicker the Mac OS particularly on this machine. The only true ""bottleneck"" on the machine is the hard drive because it is only 5400 RPM which can't deliver the best read and write speeds. But if I ever need anything better I can get another adapter and use a Samsung T5. Also again, Not to worried because Storage isn't a big factor to my use for this iMac. (although I'm sure a Built in SSD would have really helped render and boot-times)So far Im plenty happy with my purchase. And Would definitely recommend this purchase for anyone who needs a base model iMac that has beautiful aesthetics with a nice FHD screen, and can still do a pretty good job with a slight workstation load Like FL Studio, OBS Studio, Pro Logic X, Etc.. Thumbs up!(I will edit my review months from now after my warranty or if anything does come up within my warranty period.)",4.0

Otherwise, you don‚Äôt get refunded. So, instead of risking a $500 purchase on a petty return policy, I spent an extra $30 to purchase a compatible stand.

The only other temporary concern was the mouse's track pad was not functioning at first, but after about a day it randomly started working and I've had no issues since in the past two weeks, so it must have just been a fluke.

4129,B005COHOM6,RHNDG6BFE7WVQ,"Good game, gets more fun the more you play","  First, a bit about me so you know where this review is coming from: I would consider myself a moderately avid player of so-called European-style board games. I've been playing them for about five years. I tend to like shorter, simpler games that emphasize fun over intense strategization. My favorite game is Dominion; my least favorite is Diplomacy.This is a well-designed game that seems simple at first, but aquires more complexity as you get better at playing it. The rules are simple: you draw a type of land, and you must build three settlements on that type of land, adjacent to any existing settlements if possible. Where the game gets more interesting (and more fun) is through the use of special action tiles that you get for building next to certain special areas. These actions typically allow you to build another settlement in a different type of land or move one of your existing settlements away from the cluster of adjacent settlements you've been building. As you acquire these action tiles, it's increasingly fun to try to figure out your best move. While at first there is usually an obvious best move to make, your options multiply exponentially with each new action tile.As with this creator's previos game, Dominion, this game is meant to be different each time you play it. This is achieved through randomized win conditions and a randomized map. In one game, you may score points by having the most settlements in one cluster. In another, it may be just the opposite, motivating you to separate your settlements as much as possible. The random map allows for different action tiles to be in play each game, although there are only like eight possibilities, and the special powers are similar enough that I don't think it changes the gameplay all that much.I played it twice with my friends the night we bought it, and I think the consensus was that it was fun but a little too simple for us to really dig our teeth into (keep in mind that many of my friends are more serious gamers than I am). After playing a couple more times, however, everyone has found more to love. Once you get a feel for the differnt actions and how they might affect the different scoring conditions, you learn that there is a lot to consider with each turn. It's fun to think through your options and watch your friends try other strategies.My favorite thing about the game is that the scoring is rarely so obvious that you can keep track of it to a certainty during the game. I really hate playing games where each player takes ten minutes running calculations before making a move. Because there are three different win conditions in every game, you will find players making intuitive but still gut-based decisions on where to place a settlement, which keeps things loose and quick.My least favorite thing about the game is there is too little interactions between players. You're mostly just building your kingdom (as the title suggests) and rarely do you get the opportunity to mess with anyone else's. I would say there are even fewer backstabbing opportunities in this game than in something light like Ticket to Ride. There are no attack actions, and even with four players, the board doesn't get full enough that you're encroaching on each other's territory very often.All in all, a solid game. I haven't checked out the expansions yet, but if they offer more opportunity for interacting with other players, it could be a truly great addition to my collection.",4.0
4130,B005COHOM6,R3FM8N4EVP3GQ6,Good game with a lot of replayability.  Every game you play has a very different strategy,"  What To Love:The game itself is pretty simple to learn.  What I like about it is you start by choosing 4 out of 8 board pieces to make up  your game.  The boards are different in that they offer different ""special abilities"" to players.  Additionally, you chose 3 out of 10 scoring cards each game.  These determine how much gold (victory points) are earned and will radically affect what kind of strategy you implement while playing.Actual Gameplay:This offers a lot of replayability and can make for very different games.  The game itseld does requite a lot of finese and subtle strategy in terms of where to place your settlements.  Particularly because you need to weigh gaining special abilities, with points, blocking opponents, are trapping yourself in a large area that you need to populate before you can move on.Cons:All that being said, I don't ""love"" the game. I enjoy it but there are many games that I enjoy far more (King of Tokyo, Pandemic, Forbidden Island, Puerto Rico, etc. I don't object when others want to play. One caveat I would offer is that in the beginning, it's always better to go for the special abilities that include getting extra settlements early in the game over points.  Otherwise you'll fall behind other players and never recover and possibly won't even get to use all your pieces before the game ends.",4.0
4131,B005COHOM6,R1TOMFV757KEND,Good game,"  Simple game with lots of variations to enable each game to be distinct from the ones played before.  I read the rules one night and watched a few videos on the internet about the rules, and then played with the family the next day.  When actually sitting down to play the game, it is effortless and manageable, as the game is targeting kids of 8-years old and older to play.  Though the rules are simple, I tend to think counting points can be difficult with a two or three of the tradesmen cards for a younger child to figure out on his/her own.A game between two players can last around 20-30 minutes, so very fast and can keep the younger child's attention to play the game.  Games with two players should have players with nearly the same points at the end of the game, but with three or four players will cause the game to be more disruptive to best laid plans and force players to be a lot more flexible.I had no complaints about the quality of the game itself.  The boards and the chits are made of heavy-duty paper products and the cards themselves are typical thickness of cards used on other games.  It seems it will hold up to use some normal wear-and-tear.",4.0
4132,B005COHOM6,R3BPF8FVNSD92F,"Simple and Easy to Learn, with Plenty of Depth to Explore","  At first this game seems too simple in that you draw a card and place pieces on the terrain on the card and there's not a lot of thinking involved in that and you've no way to mitigate the luck of the draw.  But then as you play you realize the depth involved in this simplicity.Each game will be different based on the tiles used and what effects they may have, giving you extra abilities or options on your turn in addition to placing pieces based on the card you draw.  And each game is different due to the different win conditions - some games you may be trying to cluster your pieces all in one area while other games you're branching out as much as possible; some games you're trying to get as close to mountains or water as possible and others you don't care about terrain and just want to make a nice straight line.  Even if the tiles stay the same, with the different win conditions every game will be very different, and I like that.It's still a pretty simple game, which makes it a good game to introduce to new players or for playing with kids, but it's got enough tactics and strategy to keep adults and seasoned players interested.  Definitely a game worth owning!",4.0
4133,B005COHOM6,R2NFWQY5U77M95,Fun! Lots of re-playability!,"  Our family plays a lot of games. Ticket to Ride, Catan, Carcassonne, 7 Wonders, Azul, etc are among our favorites. This game isn't too hard to learn, and is great because the map/boards, special abilities, and victory conditions/points change every time you play. Also, the game doesn't involve directly attacking an opponent (unlike the thief in Catan), so your wife won't hate you after a round or two of Kingdom Builder. Gameplay is typically 30-45 minutes, and doesn't take too long to setup or cleanup. Highly recommend it!Only complaint is that it doesn't come with a few extra settlements of each color in a small bag. You need to have the full number of settlements each game in case you get through yours first.",5.0
4134,B005COHOM6,R19EC2BLTDM8T,Really Shines With A Variant,"  This is an excellent, gateway abstract piece placement game.  Easily taught in under two minutes, yet complex enough to get one thinking.  The premise is simple.  Each turn place three houses in terrain matching the card you have drawn.  The two catches being that, you must place the three together and if you can place them adjacent to pieces you already have on the board, you must.  Each game features a standard scoring that stays the same (for placing pieces adjacent to special spaces) and three ways to score that are randomly drawn from a deck of cards.  In addition, the boards along with some special action tokens can be different each game, leading to a new game each time.  With one expansion out already, the possibilities become endless without the rules becoming convoluted.The one drawback in the game is that it is very unforgiving at the beginning.  Your first three turns can make or break your game.  A bad initial placement can make it very difficult to recover.  While experience can help you overcome this, there's no help for you if you receive a bad card draw. (Getting two or three of the same terrain in a row at the beginning can be a particularly bad situation).  For this reason, we play with a minor variant.  Each player starts with two cards instead of one, replenishing their hand each turn.  This greatly reduces the luck factor and, in my opinion, greatly increases the enjoyment due to having more choice.  Some argue this lengthens the game, however, in my experience the length of the game is far more dependent on the playing style of those at the table. When approached about this, the designer preferred to keep the game as it was and won the Spiel des Jahres so it's obviously a quality game as written.  In my opinion, it truly shines with the variant.",4.0
4135,B005COHOM6,RJADOZIUQZCFB,Solid game. I use a variation to the very ...,"  Solid game. I use a variation to the very first turn. Instead of starting with one card, each player gets two. On their first turn, the player decides which land to play, and at the end of the turn player decides to keep the 2nd card, or discard and draw another. All other gameplay proceeds the same. We find that this adds a strategy choice in the beginning and also evens out a ""bad"" draw in the beginning.The game is sometimes on sale on amazon so wait around unless you have to buy it now.",5.0
4136,B005COHOM6,R3NZJFHLM1239L,Great for beginners and more advanced players,"  The first thing that strikes the eye is 8 considerable boards, referred to as lands covered with hexagonal net. Each of them shows a different arrangement of various areas. The boards have been made of thick cardboard and make a very good aesthetic impression.Another important element of the game are a well-made wooden houses called settlements. There are a total of 4 different color sets of 40. There are also 25 cards corresponding to the five types of terrain possible to populate the area,10 builder cards, 28 special points tokens and 8 cards with shortcut rules.The aim of the game is to build a kingdom by realizing the goals set by the builders cards. Before each game 3 cards are drawn, defining criteria for victory.Playing very well in almost every age group of different board game playing experience. Gameplay for 2 players is slightly less intense because there is more space for putting settlement houses. More strategy is needed in 3 or 4 players games when the space is smaller and you need to hurry to take the most important parts of the board.Summing up the Kingdom Builder is worth awards it received. It is the perfect family title, but also advanced players will find something interesting in the game.",5.0

Ticket To Ride

  , Kingdom Builder is a family-friendly gateway board game suitable for casual or experienced gamers. It is highly addictive, easy to learn (in about 5-10 minutes), and plays in an hour or less even with four players. Overall production value of the box, boards, and cards is extremely durable, pretty, and high.Each player begins with 40 wooden settlements (shaped like houses) that come in black, orange, blue, or natural wood. your goal is to complete all three victory conditions to the best of your ability by strategically placing your settlements to maximize your points while blocking your opponents. The game comes with ten victory condition cards of which you can pick or randomly choose three to use in each game. Examples are Fishermen (score 1 point for each settlement adjacent to water), Miners (score 1 point for each settlement adjacent to a mountain, or Lords (12 points for the largest settlement in each quadrant, 6 points for the next largest). You receive a terrain card at the beginning of the game that tells you which terrain type you must build 3 mandatory settlements on. Once you complete this, you discard your terrain card and draw a new one for your next turn's mandatory placement. Note that terrain cards are always kept secret until it you turn them face-up on your turn for the other players to see.The game board consists of four quadrants per game; you choose these from a variety of interlocking hexagonal map boards each featuring different terrain configurations and locations. Each map contains the following terrain types: desert, flower-fields, forest, grass (all open for your settlements), and two invalid terrain types: mountains and water. They also contain two or more locations: one or two castles (you score 3 points if you build a settlement next to one), and one or two of the following: barn, farm, harbor, oasis, oracle, stables, and tavern. You will place two location token on each of these (except the castles, but see Capitals rules, below for an exception). The first player to build a settlement adjacent to a location receives one token, which gives a movement and/or settlement placement bonus action each turn. For example, the paddock (stables) is easily the best one, as it allows you to move a preexisting settlement up to two hexes away in any direction and lets you bypass location, settlements, and impassable terrain (mountains, water). The harbor allows you to move one preexisting settlement onto a water hex (which may be useful for meeting other scoring conditions, but scores no points with the Fishermen victory card mentioned above). The oasis lets you place one settlement onto any desert hex you are already adjacent to, and the farm lets you do the same, only with grass. The others are slightly more complicated, so I won't go into them here, but you get the general idea. You want as many of these tokens as you can get, because you can use their bonus actions every turn either before or after your mandatory settlement placement. The more settlements you can move and/or place each turn, the more points you can score, and the faster you can end the game. Note that you can only get a token once from each location, so it's less of an issue in a 2-player game, but with 3 or more players and only 2 of each location token available, someone can get really hurt.The first player to run out of settlements initiates the end game (the other players each get one last turn). All points are tallied up at the end of the game. Scoring is often remarkably close, so you never want to assume you've won. The game is deceptively simple yet incredibly sophisticated, and has a lot of replay value. There's a reason it won the 2012 game of the year award. The designer, Donald X. Vaccarino, also created Dominion, another game of the year award winner.Sounds simple, right? Well, you can't just build on any old terrain matching your card if you have preexisting settlements built on or adjacent to the terrain on your terrain card. You must build on the terrain specified on your card if you can, thus connecting your settlements. Usually, this is a bad idea that cheats you out scoring points or getting other bonuses. You generally want to minimize how many settlements you must build in any one area. So building in a terrain type that has the smallest number of hexes is almost always a good strategy because then if you draw that terrain type again (very likely), you can select a different set of that same terrain on another part of the game board. The reason to be in different areas on the board is to 1) fulfill victory card conditions (like building next to cities, or along water, or next to mountains, or in a straight line, etc.), or 2) to get next to one of the cool location tokens that give you special powers on your turn. Once you understand the game board, you'll begin to see why playing the game requires a lot of clever strategizing.VARIANT HOUSE RULES: Some folks knock this game for its bad luck factor. You may keep drawing terrain cards you don't want or need, or never draw the ones you do. There are two easy house rule fixes to this: 1) Each player draws two terrain cards on their turn and must keep one. The other is discarded to the bottom of the deck (but both cards are still kept secret from the other players), or 2) If you draw the same type of terrain card as your last turn and don't want it, you may reveal and discard it and draw a new one. You may keep doing this until you draw a terrain card that is different from your last one. A tougher variant on this house rule would be that you must keep the second card instead, no matter if it the same (and in this case, you would not reveal the card to the other players until your next turn). Using either of these house rules is guaranteed to fix the bad luck issue that seems to be one of the main criticisms of this otherwise excellent game.There is a¬†

Kingdom Builder Nomads Expansion 1 Board Game

  ¬†expansion. It adds 40 red settlements so you can expand the game to five players, 3 new victory cards (that let you score points in-game instead of at the end), new location tokens, and new terrain maps. See my review for details.You can also order two exclusive mini-expansions from BGG. The first is called Kingdom Builder: Capitals. It gives you two new Capital city tokens that fit over two of the preexisting castles on the maps. The rules for them say that you use one capital if you are playing with either the Oracle (stonehenge) or Harbor (warship) objectives, or you use both capitals if you both objectives are in play. Unlike regular castles which only score you 3 points for the first settlement built adjacent, capitals are worth 3 points for the first settlement and 1 point for each additional settlement built within two hexes of the capital (including the first one, as the capital bonus points are scored separately after the castle bonus is determined). I've played a lot of games with the capitals and like them a lot, so much that I miss them when they aren't in play (much like stables). Of course, you could always substitute a penny or some other object for the official capital markers.The second BGG exclusive is Kingdom Builder: Caves. It gives you two Cave tokens that you can place on any two mountain hexes to create a tunnel from one area to another. Again, you can use pennies or some other token to represent the caves.",5.0

The basic game mechanic (placing three settlements on a single terrain type, adjacent if possible) is simple but requires thinking each move through. What really makes this game replayable is that it's never exactly the same game twice. You use only half of the boards in any game, and only 3 of the 10 scoring cards. This means that even in the unlikely event that you get the same four boards in the exact same positions as another time you played, the scoring conditions may be completely different, which completely changes your strategy. Creative use of the different abilities you can pick up is critical, and puzzling out the best way to accomplish your goals is a lot of fun.I mostly play this as a 2-player with my boyfriend, but it's also fun and playable with up to 4. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an easy to learn game with surprising depth.",5.0
4145,B005COHOM6,R14LF4DTYR8SQF,It seems simple enough....,"  On your turn you place three of your settlements on the board.  Sounds simple enough, but there are a few qualifications to consider:  First, you need to put the settlements on the type of terrain that matches the terrain card in your hand.  Then, if possible, you need to place your settlements next to any existing settlements you have already placed.  Then you need to consider the goals of the current game that will determine how you will score points (three goal cards randomly drawn at the outset of the game).  And if you can get a settlement next to a castle (additional points) or one of the special locations (extra settlement placement options) all the better.  Finally, if you enjoy a little cutthroat play, place some settlements where they can frustrate the plans of your competitors.  These are all placed on a game board consisting of four randomly drawn quadrants combined to make a multi-terrain countryside (the game supplies eight quadrants to draw from at the start of the game).Simple enough or too simple, that is the question.If the goal of the game is to provide a 20 to 30 minute playtime with enough in-game strategy to be fun and enough variation to entice players to play again, then I feel this game is a winner.  This game was the hit at our family's reunion this year because players could learn it quickly and get a different game experience each time they played.Like Carcasonne and Settlers of Cataan, this game is fun enough on its own but could really take off as newer expansions are added.  Additional quadrant boards, additional goal cards, new settlement types and differing gameplay options with new locations could earn Kingdom Builder's a prime spot on a gamer's shelf.If you have any questions about the gameplay or need some input on rule interpretations, the boardgamegeek website has a forum with an active community (and the game's designer even responds to the occasional rule question).",5.0

4147,B005COHOM6,RUV13A69UT5ZS,Bed of Flowers in the Hall of the Mountain King,"  I looked at the card that told me where I could play.  Since I already had settlements next to flowered hexes, that's where I had to go.  But I did have an oasis so I could place another settlement on any desert hex.  Ah!  Those flowers are by those mountains.  For each settlement next to mountains I'd get a point.  Three there... and there was one more open desert tile surrounding that city.  That scored me three points, as many points as the three flowered hexes at the foot of the mountain.  While the title didn't really exist, this would fortify my self proclaimed title of the mountain king- I was really going to pull a lot of points being next to so many mountain hexes.Before game playThis aesthetically pleasing game board is actually made of four interconnecting game boards.  There are more in the box to choose from making the map of hexes different each time you play.  This is also nice for those who maybe wanted to add additional players to the game, though they'd need to have 40 or so settlement pieces, there is an expansion that adds a red team for a fifth player.There are several goal cards that you can choose from when playing.  Hexes near water may score points for fisherman.  Miners might score points for hexes adjacent to mountains, travelers might score more points for have a settlement on each row of the board.  Hermits might score for having unconnected settlements, etc.  There are more of these than there are boards so the goals, or ways to score points vary from game to game.Each board you use has it's own feature on one of it's hexes that if you build next two before other players, you get the special power that lets you place a fourth settlement according to the powers rule or you get to move aa existing settlement.The box boasts that there are a gazillion (my word) ways to play the game.  Certainly true.Game playOn your turn you've got one card that matches a color of hexes that appear on the board, you get to place three settlements.  They need to be touching unless there aren't hexes of that color adjacent to any settlements you've previously placed on the board.  The game end is signaled when one player runs out of settlements.  Everyone gets their last ups where that's applicable and you score your points.  Pretty simple.I hate to tell you what to do but...You will always get three points for building on hexes surrounding city hexes.  This is the best way to score points.  Just saying: don't get slaughtered by people who can do math.ThemeThe maker of this game also made the deck building game of dominion.  The theme is pretty weak in both games, but that doesn't mean that an abstract games can't be fun.BalanceVery well Balanced.  But there is drawing of cards, sometimes you don't get what you want, the only way to mitigate that is to get some secret power that can help some, but the luck of the draw may even keep you from that.  I've heard complaints from players after game-end about not ever getting a forest or plains card.  Sorry.  Ok, maybe I've been one to complain.InteractionLow.  This game could easily be played very quietly, depending on the crowd you have at the table.  Murmuring of being cut off from hexes around a city or a mountain range or a river, or congrats on a good move are the sorts of comments to expect.Learning CurveVery low, if you could follow me above, you should be good.  It's a good way to introduce people to multiple paths to victory and since players must play on one color of hex, the analysis paralysis is pretty limited.DowntimeMedium.  You do have to wait your turn, and the moves of others can affect what you want to do so reconsidering easily happens despite the best laid plans.  But no one can have runaway long turns like you can have in dominion, so that's nice.What‚Äôs not to Like?The main complaint I've heard is that you only get to play on one terrain type, and that of your single card.  This can be mitigated with house rules.  Just have a hand of two cards.  This helps, but still has the same draw back of never getting the cards you wanted.  Another house rule to mix things up I like is to have a secret score card.  You are the only one who scores that way, and everyone else has their own too.Collateral EndorsementsNo one I have introduced this game to has said, well I wouldn't be sad if that game was never brought again.

That may not sound all that exciting, but there are several twists that make the game interesting.1.  There are 8 different board pieces of which you use 4 to make up the board for each game.2.  Each of the 8 board pieces has a special ability that allows you to place pieces in different ways.  One lets you place pieces in water, another allows you to place an extra piece on a desert tile, etc...3.  There are 10 different cards that determine how you earn gold (victory points) of which you play 3 each game.  One gives you points for being next to mountains, another for most pieces on 1 horizontal line, etc...The different board pieces and cards that determine victory points keep the game fun and interesting.  Each time you play, you are playing a different game!This one has been a hit in my house!  My wife and I love it, and we've even been able to teach our 5 year old son the basics of how it is played!",5.0
4152,B005COHOM6,R1D3192H33YT1E,Adaptable and Fun,"  This is an excellent game for adapting to different ages/levels of players. You select the possible special plays and goals before you set up the game. If you're playing with younger/newer players, you can choose special plays and goals that are simpler, and if you're playing with older/more experienced players, you can choose special plays and goals that are more complex. Definitely a game with plenty of replayability. Lots of fun.",5.0
4153,B005COHOM6,R3U8OOUB6PFFDD,"Excellent Mid Eurogame, fun and beautiful!","  Let me start by saying that I mostly play (and lose) with my wife so we prefer under and hour games that play well with two players and have a little messing with the other player element. I am more into the randomness type and my wife likes games with a lot of options and strategic decisions. Kingdom Builder is the perfect mix. Even thought the randomness factor is very strong ( Euro game purists tend to dislike it for that), there is strategic thinking involved and every decision is important, specially at the begining. The art is beautiful and the quality is top of the line. For the most part your are limited to what the cards dictate but what you do with that limitation is what makes this game one of those ""Easy to learn, difficult to master"".Highly recommended!",5.0
4154,B005COHOM6,RWMWINJASNVVM,Extremely fun & addictive,"  Had a blast so far playing this game with my wife & a friend.Fun with 2 or 3 players. Haven't had a chance to try with more yet.The box says games last 45 minutes, but this hasn't been the case. I'd say games last about 25-30 minutes once each player understands the gist of the game.The randomness of the game keeps things fresh. Each game is familiar, but plays entirely different.I have a couple small gripes, which have nothing to do with gameplay, but result from the bizarre packaging. There are only two sections in the box to store game pieces and cards in and it feels very cluttered. It's silly, but I like to keep my games organized. It comes with large ziplock bags to store the pieces in, but they're comically large.Furthermore, the game comes packaged with what is apparently an extra set of English cards (not necessarily a bad thing!) and several sets of non-English language cards. It was a bit confusing when trying to setup the game for the first time.",5.0

It's easy to teach to others and we usually can play with 4 people in about an hour, depending on how long people like to think! Definitely a strategy game at it's finest, and everything is well made. A perfect addition to any board game geek's closet!",5.0
4157,B005COHOM6,R4JSC7QKMACT,"Limited strategy and options, but loads of fun ~","  Kingdom Builder has won many awards, but looking online, I noticed a lot of 'meh' reviews.  Still, we picked up a set when it was $35 during the board game Gold Box deals day.  I am happy to say that we absolutely love this game.  We'll give you a quick overview then discuss the reasons for the pros and cons of this game designed by Donald X. Vaccarino of Dominion fame.+ Amazing design and lovely art+ High quality components+ Variety of goals to accomplish+ Several map boards can be interchanged+ Very fun with high replay+ Scoring at end of game rather than as game flows- Less freedom of placement- Less head to head gameplayNow let's explain:  In Kingdom Builder (KB from here out), the goal is to settle the map and gain gold (victory points).  Players assemble a map from four of the eight included map boards.  Each quadrant has a castle or two and a location or two.  They also contain grassland, canyons, desert, forests, flower fields, mountains and water.The players will then draw three cards from the mission or goal cards.  These cards tell the players what they must accomplish in order to gain gold (VPs).  These tasks will be completed and added up at the end.  Some tasks include having the most settlements in a quadrant or having a lot of settlements on one horizontal line, or gold for settlements next to water tiles or mountain tiles: there are ten in total and three are used each game.Players will draw one card from the terrain cards.  This card tells players where they must play settlements.  Each player MUST play three settlements on their turn onto the depicted terrain (in a rare instance where all those terrains are full, they draw a new card - we've never encountered this though).  The real trick here is that settlements MUST be played adjacent to existing settlements - if this is possible!  So if you have settlements on forest only and draw a desert card, you will look to see if any of your forest settlements touch desert hexes.  If so, you have to play the new settlements starting with the desert hex touching the settled forest hex.  If you draw a card and there are no settlements in or touching that terrain type, you can play anywhere.There are two interesting things that happen when you eventually settle next to a castle or location.  If you put a settlement next to a castle, you score 3 gold at the end of the game (don't score immediately, because you CAN get a location tile to move settlements).  If you place a settlement next to a location tile, you gain the extra move associated with that location and collect one of the two tiles on that location.  You can only gain these once per city / location no matter how many settlements touch either.  It is possible to gain two different location tiles if you settle next to two different locations and they have a tile remaining - but you cannot take two from the same.These location tiles offer additional, optional moves, such as placing an additional settlement on any grass hex, placing adjacent if possible and so on.  These are optional moves and do not have to be completed.  Also, they can be done before settling your three mandatory settlements - but you must reveal your terrain card first (since several optional moves have terrain specifics depending on your card).  Once you have taken mandatory and optional moves, you end your turn by drawing a terrain card and keeping it secret.  This way you can look over and plan your next moves while the other players are placing their settlements.  If the terrain draw stack is depleted, reshuffle (this is common and we found usually we shuffle once per game).The game ends when a player places their last settlements and all other players have taken one more turn afterwards.  Therefore it is possible to end the game with a lot of settlements unplayed - though this is not a good thing!  Score is tallied by adding gold acquired for each goal.  The cards specify how much (you might get one gold for every two settlements..., or one gold for each settlement..., and so on).  Then you add 3 gold for each castle a player has at least one settlement next to (so even four players can gain gold for one castle if they each have a settlement touching it).The game is fun with any number of the players from 2 - 4.  Granted, it gets a bit more confrontational with more players since players will be vying for more limited space.  With two players, it is a more peaceful game and typically players will be going for the goals in separate parts of the map.  We found that there isn't really any best number of players since it plays differently with each number of players.The complaints I hear are that the game limits your options: and it does to a certain extent.  Often you are forced to settle in one specific area due to the 'adjacent' rule.  But then there is strategy where you might avoid placing settlements touching another terrain type, so that you can move anywhere on the map (when the adjacent rule doesn't apply, you can place settlements on any terrain matching the drawn card).  Also there is a lot of strategy once you have the location tiles.  I found often that if I had one that allowed me to play something not using the adjacent rule, I could do that before playing my mandatory actions and therefore open up a new area for settlement.  In terms of Euro games, it is a medium to light game though since your moves are restricted.  Though this also helps to level the playing field somewhat for those who are not too accustomed to these types of games.I've found the game is a lot of fun.  There is a lot of variety, especially since you can mix up the maps and each map section having different location tiles with different optional moves to acquire.  Also, having three unique missions to compete for in each game keeps things fresh.I highly, highly recommend it for both those new to Euro games and those with a moderate level of skill in Euro games (or advanced players wanting a game with a level playing field for all skill levels).",5.0

I thought it was so cute because the pucks looked like little soccer balls. But even though they look very similar, they are very different in quality.  The little pucks are so light, they fly off the board constantly. We were constantly picking them up from the ground.

4178,B01MQ4IKQJ,R3P0EJK535CJSB,Perfect for our young family!,"  I had played the classic version years ago, but with young kids complicated board games are a little off the table for now. This version was great for me and my big two (6 years and 8 years). They picked it up quickly - the 8 year old won the first game even against both parents. There's still enough strategy to make it interesting but the winner is mostly the one who draws the right cards at the right time.I know some young kids are ready for the full version early, (and great for them!) but for our household with 4 young kids, we just don't have the time and focus to devote to a long and complicated game. 20 minutes and simple gameplay is about all we can handle before the toddlers tear the house apart.I would say if the YOUNGEST in the house is focused and able to handle longer games, just get the classic version and adapt for them.

It is the same idea as the original but the game play is much easier to accommodate the kids. We play with our oldest often and us parents are having just as much fun. For newbies to Ticket to Ride, it's a game where you collect train routes and the first person to complete 6 routes wins. It is a blast!

4187,B01MQ4IKQJ,R10XYOJDKUVSDF,Quality All Across the Board,"  This game is excellent.  Where to begin.Just picking up the box you can tell the quality.  It is HEAVY!  The components in this game are great.  The construction of the board is one of the best I have ever seen.  It is thick, has sturdy folds, large (easy for people to crowd around), and has some nice visuals which are important for children to use if they cannot read yet so trying to complete a ticket is able to be done by a younger child.  The plastic train pieces are detailed, and the game comes with extras just in case (with kids you are bound to lose some.....possibly even to them playing with the nice pieces outside of using them for the game because they are that nice) and each color comes with its own zip-lock baggie.  The card are thick, appealing, and high quality with a nice sheen, and the organizer in the box fits everything perfectly.The game play is simple yet competitive, where you need to strategize and possibly try to block your opponents ability to create a route to complete tickets (the objective of the game) if you can figure out their goals.  This game can be played on so many levels, even as a quick game with adults (if you want to have more competition, you can play with a modified rule set which is awesome.  You can basically use the ""express"" version rules to increase difficulty so the game can grow with the children's ability to provide years of entertainment!)  Younger children can even play it and be competitive against adults as well because the game has an intuitive rule set.This game is a win on so many different levels that I wish other games were made and designed as well as this.",5.0

Also, the game is supposed to use pictures and words to help them keep track of their routes but the pictures on the cards don't always match the pictures on the gameboard.

4248,B01MV4R07B,RS65TAWT67SFF,Oh the suspense for a 4yr old boy,"  Ok this game was perfect for my 4yr old son and I to play. He loves sharks and he loves surprises. The 1st time we opened it and put all of fish/crabs inside, he rolled the dice which has 5 sides that show 1 fish, and the last side has 2 fish. Meaning u get to fish once or twice in a row. But we caught all the fish without the shark biting, so he was a bit confused. I played it off like hmmm maybe hes sleeping lol. So in order to get it to work right you need to pop the shark back up like as if he bit. Then open jaws and press down evenly until u hear the click, or feel it. You should've seen his face when it bit, he got so excited and wanted to play with everyone. My son doesnt follow directions so well, so he kept trying to go right after me without rolling the dice and even hooked 2 fish at once and pulled them out, dont worry it doesnt mess up the play. And the shark doesnt bite on the same 1 everytime. Its random. The shark pops up fairly quick too. Over all it was fun but not worth $20. More like $12.",5.0

The gift has not been given yet so I can‚Äôt speak to it working properly or that it‚Äôs intact. What was EXTREMELY disappointing was that it was delivered only in the game box. It was not inside a packaging box and the delivery sticker was slapped crooked on the front of the box, which will NOT peel off without ripping the paper off the box. The corners and one long side corner is crunched. Fortunately my husband saw it sitting by the door before my son did.

The product is super light weight, it is made out of springs and fabric and the parts are plastic, but not so small that a baby would accidently swallow ( I also have a 10 month old). It comes with two fishing rods to pull on the fish but we omitted those and chose to pull on the fish with our hands, and it made the game so much more fun because this way if you pulled the fish that triggers the shark to bite, it catches your hand and that makes it so much more fun (and no it does not hurt). This has actually been fun for the whole family! I would definitely recommend.",5.0

My DD loved it, and so did my LO! He isn't old enough to use the fishing pole, but he just pulls them right up, and when the shark bites it doesn't hurt him or anything like that! This game is going to be a big hit at his party! It's made well. It came with two fishing poles. The shark can be difficult to place back down, but it's really no big deal you just gotta put a little extra work into it sometimes lol!

We personally use our hands instead of hooks so our hands aurally get caught in the sharks mouth which makes it more fun. 4 stars because an adult or older child (over 10 who is calm) needs to be able to push the shark back down and set it in place because with smaller children they get excited and push the mouth down toon quickly and hard and the mouth will get jammed. It happened to ours once and I thought the game was ruined but I messed with it and messed with it and finally got it to working again. All in all, a good family game.",4.0

4260,B01MV4R07B,RYG2UBYMKJUQ9,Fun game for preschooler.,"  My grandson really likes playing this game. I was afraid the shark would close it's mouth much quicker which might have been startling but it is slow enough so it doesn't make him startle or jump. Pulling the sea creatures out can be a little tricky (you need to pull straight up) or the shark's jaw will close and it can take a couple of tries to push the shark down with the jaws open so it stays, but not enough of a problem to make the game frustrating for him.",5.0
4261,B01MV4R07B,R37NTJRRB2IJIC,Fun when it works,"  This is a fairly simple game, my kids and the family have fun when it works.  Our shark only jumps about 20% of the time.  I mean after resetting the game after someone get ""bit"" you can pull all the fish and no bite. replace all the fish and try again still nothing.  I gently push it to jump and reset and sometimes we can play a game where the shark jumps.My youngest seems to enjoy feeding the shark and then fishing and doesn't care as much if it jumps - but it makes for a fairly boring game otherwise.The small fishing polls can separate easily and 1 half can then get lost - but we have been functioning with one pole just fine.",3.0

The Shark mechanism however is touchy and tends to spring up easily (like setting off a mouse trap) when bumped during setup or during game play.  It's a neat concept, and some of my kids enjoy using it. but for kids who are not very patient or who have poor motor control it's not very fun/functional.",3.0

Suspend your disbelief, and have a good time.Since I was attracted to the movie by way of the trailer, the casting was actually a surprise.  Jason Bateman is in maximum mail-it-in mode, but he's great anyway.  You'll recognize many of the ancillary characters.  There's even a Michael C. Hall sighting!  Without giving too much away I can say that the real scene stealer in the movie is Jesse Plemons, better known as Todd (Meth Damon) from Breaking Bad.  Perhaps I assumed he didn't have comedy in him, but Pleamons is brilliant as ""Gary"".As predictable as parts of this movie are, there are still some surprises to be had.

4272,B079XXJVQW,RM7DHLW7WHZ3L,Solid All-around Film,"  While Game Night doesn't have the dense layers of jokes-per-minute that some comedies get caught up in, what it does have is depth of tone and technique. Even without the comedy, you'd still have an interesting story with satisfying character development. Without the laughs, there are sequences that are well shot and could easily have been in an action movie. When you add in the humor, you get a unique combination of a movie that seamlessly blends comedy, action, and thriller in a way that, to me, never felt forced or out of place. There's also some very clever references to gaming without beating the viewer over the head with it. If you're on the look-out, you may notice that, scene-to-scene, the cast are playing funny, real-life versions of Guess Who, Hot Potato, and Operation (among many others). Even the camera seems to be in on it, as we often see the director use an angle very reminiscent of games like Grand Theft Auto during the car chase scenes.",5.0

We didn't laugh or even crack a smile throughout those 30 minutes, but rather just shook our head as the movie was so poorly done.  Not only were the characters extremely annoying, but the scenes that play out are not even well done.I've only shut about 3 movies off in my whole life and this is one of them.

In other words, it's not a solid piece of plastic - there are holes cut out of the case to save money on plastic. That's fine, but not when the products gets smashed in transit.

4329,B001SN8GF4,R176RVXI1Z5B28,"Fun, just consider buying more markers ahead of time","  This game is a lot of fun, it's a great party game that helps people get acquainted or you can tease your long time friends with. It's fun for 2, maybe 3 rounds a night but realistically that's a decent amount of time if you're not comparing yourself to the serious board game people. I first played it a year and a half ago and someone had said that it's a ""great game but you could easily make it yourself"" I brushed this off because it's true of a lot of board games, where the maker of the game  shoe horns in unnecessary items like a timer, board or buzzer to make it a more complete package (even though these things have no effect on the fun of the game or could easily be replaced with an app) Anyways I brushed this off, I didn't want to take the time to make my own white board rolladex and recreating the experience with spiral notebooks, pens and a word generating app would feel too cheap. My problem is that out of the box two markers didn't work, and sharing markers really slows down the game, I felt throwing in an extra couple markers to make up for drunken misplacing or them being DOA would have made up for the $30 price point. Again this game is fun, it's low stakes, quick game that's a great icebreaker. I highly recommend picking this up, just consider buying extra dry-erase markers (maybe with finer points)",4.0
4330,B001SN8GF4,R36DCPOI5LPKEP,Didn't Enjoy This Game,"  We love playing games at our house and enjoy a pretty wide variety of game types. I saw this game and bought it based on the good reviews. I had expected it to be similar to ""Win, Lose, or Draw,"" a game I used to enjoy playing in the past. Unfortunately, this game was not nearly as fun, and really more of a dud for us and our guests. It doesn't initiate any communication/interaction between players, except at the very end when each person goes through and explains their boards. No one really seemed to enjoy it and passing the boards around got old quickly. The game can also get back-logged easily, while some players wait for others to finish drawing. We didn't like any of the proposed scoring methods, so we opted not to keep score. All and all, the game is okay, but needs something to make it more engaging and fun to play. I'd recommend watching a YouTube video of gameplay before deciding whether or not it's something you'd enjoy.",1.0

We are not a raucous group, but at times we were crying we were laughing so hard from silly pictures and guesses in this game. If you have a competitive family and often have individuals leave or quit because someone is ""cheating"" or thinks it's ""not fair"" then this is the game for you! Because each turn builds off the person to your right, there is no pressure, no competition, and no down side. The worse you can draw, the better it gets!

4332,B001SN8GF4,R1T6Q6AVNID9P2,Fun for the whole family.,"  I purchased this after playing it with several co-workers. It's honestly a great game that works well with a wide variety of people. The instructions are fairly easy and the fun is looking to see how people interpret your original drawing. It's best played with a large group of people, as the more drawings and interpretations you have, the wilder and crazier the guesses can get. You can play it with less, although it can sometimes be hard to keep up depending on the crowd (and amount of drinks). It's also easy to get people excited in the game - I played this while on vacation with my boyfriend's family. I only had about six people playing the first night, but we had so much fun that people came over to watch and during the second night we had eight. We had a child playing with us that was about seven years old and although we had to help him with spelling, he absolutely loved playing because it's something he can play with adults that isn't an out and out kid's game.My only quibble with the game has to be with its point system - it seems to be fairly complicated, enough so that I've never bothered to use it nor have others that I've played with. It's much more fun to just pass around the books and compare everything once it's done. The pads and pens are OK - one of my pens was dry when I received it, but that's kind of par for the course with anything that comes with markers and has the potential to sit around for months in a warehouse. You can use most dry erase markers with this, so it's easy to replace.",5.0
4333,B001SN8GF4,R2I04CRN9YQBDP,A must-have for your party game collection,"  This is one of those games that I frankly couldn't understand what the big deal was the first time I was set to play it.  I have played many party games over the course of many years and I'm generally not a fan of the ""drawing"" games, so I was prepared to just grin and bear it.By the time I was done with my first game, I was crying from laughing so hard.  This is a great ""we're laughing with you"" experience.  Sure, winning is great, but honestly, everybody is a winner in this game because it's just so darn entertaining.  This is a wonderful game for getting people to let their guard down a bit, and if you have kids that are focused on whether or not they are winning or losing, this is a game that will help them see you can just have fun.  And yes, kids love this game. It is as kid-friendly as the group of players is.I can describe this as the old children's game ""Telephone"", with a drawing twist.  But that is a serious undersell.  It doesn't sound like it would be that entertaining, but trust me it is!This is sold in 6, 8 and 12 player editions.  I would suggest that you decide which one to get the same way you buy a tent.  Get it a little bigger than you think you need it.  Once it becomes known in your playing circle, you will have no problem getting everyone to play.",5.0
4334,B001SN8GF4,R1GQRIEHKTVIF7,So much fun!!!,  This game is so much fun! It's a combination of the old telephone game and pictionary. Each player has a dry erase marker and pad and every round a word or phrase is picked from a card drawn. You then sketch the word/phrase and pass the pad to the next player. They in turn guess what is drawn. After guessing the pad is passed again and the next player has to draw what was guessed. This continues until the pad arrives back at the original owner. At that point you go through the sequence from the beginning to the end. It is amazing how the word/phrase changes as it makes it's rounds. Wonderful belly laughs for all. This is a great family game and can be played by all age groups.,5.0

They are getting older and it is hard to get them to play board games anymore.  We had three of them over for a sleepover, ages 15, 12, and 8.  They loved the game and we played it for quite a large part of the evening.  They got up the next morning and asked to play it again.

It is very easy to play and it brings a lot of laughter, joy, shock and makes the bonding time/family time great. I did not see my dad laughing as hard as he did while playing this game in a very long time! I will definitely recommend buying this game because it lightens up the environment and provides a quality laughter time with your friends and family. Also, for any small team event, I would consider adding this game as an ice breaking game.The game comes with all the necessary items that you need to play the game with, and even if you run out of any of of the items, you can purchase it easily from a departmental store, such as markers, sand timer, dice, etc.I use a marker cleaner instead of the cleaning cloth provided for keeping the dry-erase surface clean and in-tact. I plan on using the cards from other games such as taboo to incorporate variety in words, once we play this game plenty of times to be able to guess the card words. Also, I noticed that they have a ""after the dark"" edition as well, which should be fun too!! Have lots of fun playing this game!!",5.0
4337,B001SN8GF4,R1ZVW7TEMJR4RM,One of the most fun games I've ever played despite some quality issues,"  This will leave you in tears of laughter. It's the best game to come along in I don't know how long. Play is simple, and no matter how good or poor an artist players are, if they can scribble on paper, practically anyone in your group can get involved regardless of age. It is appropriate for all ages in that it is clean, but the very youngest children will probably not often  understand the word or phrase they will have to draw if you're thinking of including them. I think children as young as 8 are able to play without it being too challenging; if they get a word they don't understand, tell them to choose one of the words the know. There are some issues with the low quality dry erase markers and the tiny microfiber cloths each person receives to wipe their book clean. If you leave the cap off too long, say during one complete round of play, the marker tip dries up a bit and won't draw. I made the mistake of putting the cap on and giving it a couple of shakes only to have virtually all the ink become deposited in the cap, making a terrible black, inky mess that resulted in throwing out the pen. You'd think they could include higher quality marking pens for what the game costs. Go ahead and purchase some decent quality dry erase markers to keep with your game and throw the original ones out. Don't bother using the tiny cleaning cloths. They will quickly become covered in dried marker residue and not be very effective. Have a box of plain tissue on hand instead. Make sure all the pages in each booklet are erased before putting the game away or the marks will be very difficult to remove and leave behind a faint stain. We only use the timer if there is anyone being a meticulous artist and repeatedly holding up game play. If all the contents of the box were better quality, I would have rated it better for value, but as it stands, the game only gets its material value from the cards and booklets. I still highly recommend this game, though, because it is hilariously fun to play!",5.0

Took a gamble for this for our Christmas gift as an investment with the friends and was not disappointed.  a clue like sportscar that ends up as UFO watching  or spermwhale that ends up as..... well the old story about  a whale named Moby can cause some serious hysterical moments with plenty of tears from laughter.I always thought the old game it was based off of was stupid but knew no one in our families could draw so it would be a fun twist.  would recommend to others.,5.0
4339,B001SN8GF4,R3C90HT2G7N6A4,An Awesome Twist on the Telephone Game,"  Telestrations is so much fun - the bigger the group the better. This game works best when you have 8 or close to 8 players, just because of how the rotation is set up. The game consists of 8 dry-erase drawing tablets and markers, and a set of double-sided playing cards. Each player chooses a card so that they know what word or phrase they are starting with. You draw the item, then pass your tablet to the next person. They guess what you drew, then pass it on. They draw the guess, then pass it on. And so forth until it gets back to you, and you can see how far from your original word that the guesses traveled. This isn't set up as a competition game, but rather a cooperative game. So there isn't a winner, but it is an absolute blast to play. We played with ages ranging from 8 years old to 72, and everyone loved it. It's a nice break from fierce competition on game night, and a fun way to spend time with family.",5.0

The only complaint is that the markers wear out somewhat fast and are a bit too thick, creating sloppy artwork and making any sort of small detail-work overly difficult, which is unnecessary in a timed situation, which is how this game is played anyway. I keep having to buy dry erase markers from the 99Cents Store to replace the ones in this box.",4.0
4341,B001SN8GF4,R2SVLU93T530XI,Fun for the whole family (including teens and young adults),"  We learned about this game from cousins - huge game nights with a range of kids through 20-somethings. Everyone is laughing. For some, puzzling out it more fun than the drawing, but it's great to see all the varieties of thought. We got this and immediately played it out of the box - two families - adults and teens. Everyone gets a card and according to a die roll you get an assigned word or term. Depending on the number of players you either illustrate that term, or pass it one. You continue passing the booklets around only looking at the last drawing or guess at the term before you take a guess or draw from the previous guessed term. This is the game ""telephone"" but done in drawings and guesses at the drawings. Once your little book makes it around back to you, each person shares what happened with their word. It's exciting when the group stays close to the term, like ""playground"" and funny when it goes way off track...""bat cave"" to Halloween.",5.0

Pass the tablet to the next person. They have to guess the word based only on what was drawn. They write that word and pass it to the next person who has to draw that word, and so on. By the time it goes around the table, you'll be on the floor laughing at how far off the guesses and pictures have become and seeing where things went horribly wrong. Easy and fun. Booklet pages are whiteboard coated for use over and over. Comes with markers. I'd recommend cleaning with whiteboard cleaner before they go back in the box so they don't stain.",5.0

My 7 and 10yr olds love playing this game.You will definitely want to use the wipe cloths provided to clean the books every time, otherwise the piles from your fingers will ruin the markers. We learned that one the hard way.

My entire family enjoys this game so much I keep it in my car so that we can play it wherever we are. I even have several friends that have bought the game since I got it, and it is often a requested game to play. My 9 year old niece loves to play it so it is also a good game for kids, as long as they can read and have basic understanding of what things are. I only have two slight complaints. 1.

I do find that when mixed with alcohol people can have a REALLY hard time following the process. I find myself having to constantly direct people on what to do.

4349,B001SN8GF4,R270J5N7U1946U,Super fun to play and very easy to learn,"  This is a super fun game, and a perfect one to play when you are to ""shelter in place."" This is a very easy game to learn: directions are printed on the whiteboard booklets that are passed out to each player. Because this is based on Telephone, booklets are passed around as each player tries to guess the drawing. Laughs abound when the  original booklet is passed back to the original player. The only downside is that the markers do not last all that long, so plan on having extra white board markers in your cupboard.",5.0
4350,B001SN8GF4,R1MGA85JOSL5NM,Huge hit!,"  This game is so much fun! A little difficult to explain to a group of players but after a practice round, everything was clear. If I had to do anything differently, I would buy the 12 Player version so that we could have a larger group. The more people, the more fun! A huge hit at Christmas Eve! Youngest player was 9 years old and the oldest was 53.",5.0
4351,B001SN8GF4,R2LOBVKB5J28WD,Best game out,  This is one of the best games we have played. Haven't laughed so much in years.  Our Friday nite game group tried this. It was an instant hit.  We play with 6-8 players.  We did find it wasn't as much fun with 4or less players and we could easily adjust game for more.  Recommended it to friends across US and they have loved it as well.  Should be game of the year.  8and up and mixed age DoubleClick all play.  They also have a large party version some friend bought and love.,5.0
4352,B001SN8GF4,R5BY5P9L5NE0F,Great Game,"  This is a great game for a bunch of friends just wanting to sit back and be silly. If you've never played it, it's a graphical take on the old ""telephone"" game where you whisper a phrase to the person next to you and they pass it down the line, then you compare what the first person said to what the last person heard. In this case, you're drawing the word or phrase and the next person has to guess and then the next person has to draw what they guessed, so on down the line. The results can be absolutely hilarious. The dry erase markers are a bit cheap but it's not hard to find replacement markers at the local drug store. Also, one of my books was put together in the wrong order which made it confusing the first time we played it. But since they are spiral bound, we just took it apart and put the pages in the correct order. It wasn't something that affected our enjoyment of the game.",5.0
4353,B001SN8GF4,R2YXNL5J3HGY8,Great family game!  Everyone loves it.,"  This is such a wonderful game for family game night we've played with kids as young as 7 and adults as old as 75.  Easy to learn, but we changed the rules a bit- we allow players to chose any phrase or word on their chosen card to illustrate.  We also never keep score- It's so much fun to walk through the various illustrations and laugh, by the time we've shared everyone's, no one cares what a score might be.  (Eliminates so much bickering as well!) EIther way you play this game is a hit.",5.0
4354,B001SN8GF4,R1EQRR3TXKDQ76,This game is a blast for all ages!,"  Recommended to me. I ordered it with fingers crossed; Game Day was two days away! It arrived as everyone arrived. We ditched all the other games we had planned and all of us, ages from 59 to 7 played this game exclusively for 5-6 hours! We usually have a card game, board game, puzzle and kids' game going. This was FUN!",5.0
4355,B001SN8GF4,R2VO93NOBBCOOH,Fun and easy to play with all ages.,"  I originally played the game with my sons family over the holidays.  They received it as a gift.  We played with ages between 72 and 7 years.  Other than being lenient with the timer, with the younger ones involved, we found it easy to play and a lot of fun for all of us.  I bought one as a gift shortly after I played and now bought one for my own household for when we have family or company over.  It is a good icebreaker and does not take a lot of talent to do the drawings.",5.0
4356,B001SN8GF4,RSBK42TR9EWZG,Hilarious game for the whole family!,"  The rules are simple so it's easy to get playing right away. The first time we played with 8 people aged 10 to 66 and we laughed so hard our faces ached after. We played again with a group of 8 aged 5 to 45 and it was a bit tough for the 5 year old but everyone still had a blast. I absolutely love the game. We tried it with a group of 4 tonight and laughed to tears. We only used the timer one round and I don't think it's necessary unless you have someone you're always needing to wait for. Wonderful concept, easy and super fun to play.To play, each person has a little spiral book with whiteboard like pages. Everyone draws one card that has a word like ""castle"" or a simple concept.  With an even number of players, each person draws their word and passes it to the next person who then writes their guess of what the picture represents, and that continues until it gets back to the original owner.What makes this game extra special to me is everyone does something every round. You get to actively participate the whole time. Also awful drawers aren't really a drawback because their awful attempts add a whole new level of hilarity. We found this a great family game and look forward to playing again!Wishes: I wish I'd gotten the party pack so I had 12 pads. I'd like more cards. I felt like we repeated them too quickly. I'd happily buy card or pad expansions.",5.0
4357,B001SN8GF4,R39PLOXTITTUNG,This game is proof board games are not dead!,  If you are looking for a huge amount of laughter and fun with your friends and family.......this is the game! I was introduced to this game by friends and our mouths hurt from laughing and smiling so much. What a great concept executed nicely in this board game. After buying it my family and I have lured several friends over with offers of dinner and a ‚Äúboard game‚Äù. They have all arrived hungry but not real jazzed about a board game. They have all walked out of here exclaiming this is the most fun they‚Äôve had in quite some time! There are two versions. The other one is the ADULT version and comes in a black box. My review is for the family version. Read the description carefully and make sure you are getting the correct one. Have a blast!,5.0
4358,B01CPUJVOI,R3CZ6DP9XIG94F,"Great fun, looks great on the bookshelf","  We decided to try the no-frills version after the newest 'card and electronic banker' version was loud, had flashing lights, and removed some of the math fun that makes this a classic.  This is exactly what we wanted--we even love the classic fonts and the houses..and the pieces were vintage looking versus shiny..we had hours of family fun this weekend and no doubt started a new tradition.  Only tip I would give is that since the board has more seams, as it is folded more than the traditional 4-way, it can be a little more delicate at the seams when opening/closing...or me not being careful enough with it...but not material to the game in the slightest.  Love it...recommend it.  Just an added note -- I don't know if the instructions for this version are any different (other than being laminated)...but they are the very clear to understand.",5.0
4359,B01CPUJVOI,R212ADEZEKQUFU,"Needs more play money, but still a good investment for two people.","  So, I read other reviews before making my purchase and this is my two-cents.  It‚Äôs a beautiful game and my husband and I love the compact size; however, there is only enough money for two people.  There are not enough $100 bills for 3+ players.  Thankfully it‚Äôs just the two of us now.  I am going to look for more play money, but in the mean time a pen and piece of paper can help us keep track of money when we have more players.  The compact size does mean the board is slightly smaller.  I laced it on top of another full-size Monopoly I own and this bookshelf edition appears to be more rectangular than the regular board.  It‚Äôs ~1 inch smaller on the short edges and ~0.5 inch smaller on the long edges.  All other game pieces are to scale, therefore they are also smaller, but it‚Äôs barely noticeable.  The game does have a vintage look to it and by that I mean the card colors and writing appears to be faded, but it‚Äôs still easy to read.  Lastly, the game box and book covers were more grey than they appeared in the photo.  Personally, I hated the box and will not keep it, but the book is lovely.",4.0

4362,B01CPUJVOI,R2JVQ0ADSUSKTY,Cute packaging idea!,"  When I recieved my game I was looking foward to playing, but after opening and viewing the contents I've come to notice there isn't enough money for more than 2 players, if even. The money is much smaller than the original game but the board, cards and pieces are the same size. There are also not enough houses if all properties were to have a house or hotel,  even if only 2 players.  The concept of the small packaging made to look like a book is cute. Great to place on a book shelf.  As a gift its nice, but not for a family of more than 2 people.  Great size for traveling, would fit in luggage. Instructions are easy to understand. Looks like the original. Just wish it had more money, would make using & playing easier.",3.0

I had tacos, topped up the fuel in my truck, and headed home where my package sat waiting for me.I figured since it's from Hasbro it should be fine for the kids to play with so I handed it of to them after the unboxing and proceeded to take pleasure in popping the bags of air that came with it.It wasn't ten minutes later I hear screaming and the dog is barking. I rush into my kids room and see this shadow crash through the window. My dog has blood on his fur and the board is on fire!I pulled the curtains closed cause we all know sunflower colored drapes keep demons at bay and then turned to my kids. ""What did you do?"" I asked. They said they just wanted to talk to Santa and let him know what they wanted but my kid isn't the best at spelling (or doing chores for that matter) and I guess they maybe summoned Satan, or maybe just a demon.I don't know but I do know that you should take precautions when playing with board games.

4471,B01BDK1O64,R376P8EGHW5MON,Decent quality for the money,"  Bought for paranormal investigations, but soon after my daughters and nephew an niece got ahold of it one night everything changed. Honestly I don't care who believes me. We hear footsteps every night at 11. We've had lights an tv come on an off in the middle of night when sleeping. I decided to buy motion sensor camera an caught a orb manifest from my bedroom an came down hallway at what time? 11pm you guest it. Last night me an my wife fell asleep on couch an around 11:45 I woke up to this glowing white figure standing over my wife, it's like I was paralyzed by this entity. Soon after it floats off down hallway and I hear 4 steps when no one was awake. I began yelling trying to get my wife awake , but she would not wake it's like she was in a trance or something after shaking her repeatedly she finally wakes up. That's the first time I've seen a spirit an it spooked me. I have played ouija before when I was 16 now 31 so it's been awhile.  My mom a house is still haunted from it, I had my bed shake uncontrollably twice an the second time a witness was with me.

4473,B01BDK1O64,R3QBD6XOML1C10,So far not believing the hype with these things,"  Hi there. I am a practicing pagan of 16 years. I have read my fair share of books on this subject and have practiced many rituals in my time. I have studied shamanism, necromancy, elemental witch craft, and Wicca. Spanning cultures anywhere from Ancient Egypt, to Native American, Norse, Gaelic and Asian. My primary practice summed up is: Necromancy using Ancient Egyptian magick with a strong Wiccan base. I also use Tibetan singing bowls, and Native American smudging rituals using an abalone shell with sage. This cleanses your space of spirits and negative energy.My fianc√© and I gave this board a go last night. I had my candles lit, positioned correctly, my necromantic spirit guide/skull, named Michael setup (See The Witches Book Of The Dead by Christian Day)- I even had Frankincense and myrrh incense going in front of the skull. We opened the conversation and proceeded to ask questions. I am not unfamiliar with speaking with spirits, it‚Äôs what I do. But the board was dead as a door nail. We had a moment where the candles began to flicker rapidly out of nowhere, after asking a question. That was about it so far.I realize these things can take several tries. We are going to try again around 3AM sometime. And we will try again after midnight as well. I have had more reactions from a candle alone than this board. Maybe our altars intimidate spirits. My god of choice is Anubis after all, and his job is to guide spirits to the underworld for the weighing of the ostrich feather vs the heart. We have seen entities in our apartment before, as well as items disappearing and a few poltergeists - I saw my shoe levitate off of the shoe rack and propel itself forward once. So we KNOW spirits have been here, and do pass through here.The board itself is rather small and flimsy. It seems to be made of cheap cardboard like material, with a cheap print of the ouija board glued around it.If we continue to get zero responses here, even under the next full moon, I may try taking it somewhere else to try it. I deliberately left the ouija board out unattended last night, and absolutely nothing happened you guys. No spooks, no curses, no stuff thrown all over the place . Just nothing. So I am skeptical (even against Christian day) that these are a viable means of communication with the dead.Mind you, I was an atheist for three years recently, so I am critical when observing supernatural phenomenon. I employ that analyzing process to my rituals, so no subconscious ‚ÄúBS‚Äù takes place. I feel like a lot of people on here are just moving the planchette themselves and are going through the subconscious motions that scientists use to debunk ouija boards.That being said, I can tell you I have in fact seen ghosts, I have seen entities and creatures with my own eyes that are definitely supernatural. And until I see or hear something as concrete as what I have already seen in my lifetime, I won‚Äôt call it a successful session. Wish us luck.Update: nothing happened over the full moon. Nothing at all. Honestly this board is further increasing my skepticism that any of it is real at all. My past experiences could have been over active imagination, crumbling under stress, lack of sleep. So many things to be honest. I am walking away from this board an atheist. Lmao",1.0

He would leave me to go work and really weird stuff was happening, tv downstairs came on while I was upstairs, the PlayStation controller would skip around the show or movie that was playing on the tv when the controller was off and most importantly the door would fly open at random when it was closed and locked.

You have to go online for all the rules and set up,  but once you have it, it is easy to play.However.... WARNING FOR TWO PLAYERS...Do not shuffle the cards before you play two players.

However, other players can steal and kill your unicorns, so it's enough strategy for them where they can basically pick between 3 options:1) Build your stable2) Defend your stable3) Attack your opponentsThat's basically it.  The options are limited enough that they are able to understand after only a couple rounds of playing and it's a great starter game if you ever want to get them into MTG or some other horrifically confusing strategy game.

I didn't expect much, but in playing it a couple of times, it's actually kind of fun. The instructions are deceptively simple on first glance, which causes some confusion and ""negotiations"" about what the rules say or mean, but once you hash out a few things, the rules are actually pretty straightforward and simple.This is a card game that tends to be half luck based and half skill based. Certainly, the core concept and objective requires you to weigh some options and make some basic plans about how you'll attempt to meet the goal, but this game is fairly fast paced and fun because it doesn't involve or really allow long-scope planning or strategy, since what you get in your hand or what happens to you in any given round is between the luck of the draw for you and the other players and what they decide to do. The designers did a good job of incorporating some counters to various attacks by players (chiefly in the ""Neigh"" card and certain upgrades that will negate that card or other attacks).Overall, it's easy to start this game and play is fairly quick, intuitive and fun. It's well balanced between outright sabotage of other players, strategy, goal setting, and luck, and there are a lot of unique upgrades, downgrades and unicorn types that make the game entertaining.",4.0

It caught my eye to try this game and here is my review1. MechanicsAt first, it was confusing because we are just familiarizing the gameplay but as we keep on playing and reading the manual ang the instruction cards we got the hang of it, in maybe 3-5 gameplay2. Level of difficultyI rather not buy this game if you are a parents and wants to play with your child that is not that quite yet attentive to the rules because there are chained effects in the game that makes it interesting but if the player does not know how to administer that then it would lack that uniqueness of the game.3. ExcitementFor me, it is a game that makes the unicorns have life on its own because of the abilities it brings to the gameplay. . and each card has its own part that might co tribute along chain of effects. .Overall a game that is fun to do over and over with plenty of players because it can be unpredictable if played right.",5.0

4509,B07BMLQBM1,R3GZ05WK4NQ4DT,Please learn how to write instructions!,  The game would be fun if the instructions were slightly clearer than mud. The problem is they define some words in the instructions but they don‚Äôt always align with the instructions on the cards. They also don‚Äôt explain how the unicorns get to the stable or that there is no purpose to the nursery. If the stable is where you are supposed to play all of your cards put that in the instructions. If words don‚Äôt aleays mean the same thing in the game the. don‚Äôt define words differently. l see this issue all too often and l‚Äôm tired of instructions that aren‚Äôt consistant and don‚Äôt really explain the product properly.,2.0

Easy enough to play with teens or even the precocious pre-teen, random enough for people to at different skill levels to still have fun, but not so random you feel out of control (e.g. Exploding Kittens).The rules are complicated enough you'll run into some ambiguous situations, but that's true for just about any game more complicated than Candyland.  It plays a lot like Munchkin, which is also one of its biggest drawbacks.  My friends and I are pretty experienced gamers, and very quickly we settled into a defensive, pick on the player in the lead strategy, stretched game that is rated for 30-45 minutes into 3 hours, and ended without a winner.

Hasbro can rest assured, even without the tacky badge, nobody will mistake this product was made before planned obsolescence was normalized.Yes, the tiles are wood, but as others have stated, the board is sub par. It's similar to a glossy magazine cover glued onto cardboard. Pretty standard for a new board game, but disappointing for a product you're spending a little more on for a tactile flashback. On opening, the graphics were already cracked at the center seam. There is no way this board could withstand more than 10 gentle opening and closings without cracking the seam to the point of it needing tape. The tiles are unvarnished with printed lettering. Not sure if that's a feature of the original version. The tile font doesn't look like what I remember as a kid--this version looks more like the lettering in the Agway logo, but thinner.

4562,B00EFDXAB4,R4SFVSIB10KVK,"When In Doubt, Ouija Makes A Great Christmas Gift","  I have never been a fan of playing with Ouija Boards.  Even though it's made by Parker Brothers (yeah, like Monopoly) it's always had that mystical vibe of foreboding.  Warned by my mother since I was a wee lad not to mess with things we don't fully understand, the Ouija has always held a dark fascination with me.  So when I was searching for a gift to get my 23 year old daughter, I thought why not?  We excel at getting each other freak gifts.  When it arrived at the house (so very promptly) there was no harbinger of destruction on the doorstep.  The box wasn't seeping brimstone or blood.  I looked it over.  When the time came for presents to be opened on Christmas day, we always play a guessing game before we open the gifts.  My daughter guessed the Ouija.  Clairvoyance?  She's a good guesser.  Even though I know it's just a Parker Brothers game (just like Monopoly) I made it a point to make sure she didn't open the Ouija in my house.  Superstitious?  Perhaps?  There are too many unsettled spirits in my home that I prefer not to antagonize.  Seriously.  Documented issues that cannot be swept away by simple explanation.  On one occasion I've heard the piano play in my living room when absolutely no one but me was home.  When I investigated, the piano itself was closed.  Creepy.  Over the past 20 years perhaps 6 different people have experienced issues in my home that could not be readily explained.  I have never informed anyone of anything supernatural and yet those 6 people sought me out and said ""ok, what's going on in the house?""  That being said, I still thought the Ouija was a great gift, but I prefer not to play around with things of that nature.  Superstitions die hard when disembodied voices are coming from the closet in your guest bedroom.  Someday maybe, I'll give it a spin.  At my daughter's house.  Definitely not at home.  The spirits here don't need a board to communicate.  Dig it!",5.0

4578,B01LZXVN4P,R2FY9EAIY6I66L,This game is absolutely wonderful!,"  Long Story short: This game is absolutely wonderful! This (according to many board game review sites) is set to be the top game of 2017, and I 100% recommend getting yourself a copy, though it will likely be difficult/take some time. Its definitely a HOT selling item and I was lucky enough to pre-order mine a month ago before other folks started seeing it listed on Amazon. This is definitely worth getting and will make a huge hit to your gaming nights! A more detailed breakdown is below.(Note relating to pictures: The game does NOT come with painted miniatures. As I enjoy paining them, I did so, but my wife and I played several games before they were painted without any issues/confusion. They just look cooler/it's more immersive in my opinion when they are painted.)Legacy Mechanics: (A legacy game is a game that does not reset from one playthrough to another. But rather, like reading a story, each game played builds on the next, in an overall 100+ hour 'campaign'. Note unlike other campaign/legacy games, this does not require a single playgroup, but rather you can start a new party with just about anyone, anytime, and you just 'drop' into your already existing world to plunder dungeons and kill baddies) The game comes with 17 playable characters, but you only start with 6. As you play through the game you 'unlock' new characters/races/classes to play as. Additionally as you play through, you will be able to ""level up"" the prosperity of the town of Gloomhaven, which is where your party will travel between adventures to level up, buy/sell gear, get your grog (or mead) on, and perform random town events. As Gloomhaven levels up, new items become available to purchase, and any new characters can start their quests at higher levels. As you play through, and eventually retire characters, you will gain additional permanent 'stat' boosts that apply to all your characters going forward. Like many other Legacy game this game includes a bunch of sealed envelopes, unlockables, and high quality stickers, that go on the area map, as well as on character cards. UNLIKE many legacy games, I feel like this can easily be played through again, without having to buy another copy of the game. You don‚Äôt need to rip up cards or anything in this game, and other than the character card upgrades, the experience wouldn‚Äôt necessarily be ruined by having all the locations already on the map. I imagine it would be like playing Skyrim a second time through; less surprises, but allows you to fully explore character/class types you didn‚Äôt previously and allows you to take separate paths than you took the first time.Story: Don't worry, I won‚Äôt spoil anything. The game has tons of missions (90+). You start with just one, but similar to all those RPG video games we love, you begin unlocking more and more. Then pretty soon you find yourself with branching and interweaving stories. Some have consequences that have an impacts on others. For example, will you go and work for this shady contact you meet who is obviously up to no good? Or will you take up a mission to hunt down and kill the shady contact, preventing them from unleashing havoc. Whatever choice you make, it 'locks off' other missions; you can't work for someone if you brought their head to the city guard ;)  Of course you can always enter ""casual mode"" and play through these missions, its your game afterall, but I personally won‚Äôt be doing this until I complete the full game a month or so down the line.Map: The game comes with a wonderful looking board map of Gloomhaven's surrounding area. Overall the map is fairly blank to start with, and you begin the game by applying a sticker in a specific location, representing the available missions you can travel to. While I am not even close to completing it yet, it already looks great and will undoubtedly look amazing after your adventures are complete.Gameplay: This is a semi-cooperative game. Overall each character has a personal goal (the reason why they choose to risk their lives fighting monsters) that they are trying to achieve. After you achieve this your character retires from the game (though you can start a new character with the same class) and you unlock various things, including new characters. Of course using team work to assist each other and actually beat dungeons is essential, overall you are trying to complete your own goals while others are simultaneously doing theirs. When you aren't visiting town/traveling you will be spending a vast majority of the game delving into dungeons, crypts, forest encampments, ancient temples, etc. (You know, all the classics!) Setup/tile placement is VERY similar to games like Decent or Shadows of Brimstone. However there are NO dice in this game, not 1! Instead, movement/combat is performed via playing from a hand of cards. You begin every dungeon with a set amount of maximum cards (~10). And each round you play 2 cards, performing 2 actions (typically a move type action and one that centers around attacks of some sort). After this the cards go to your discard pile, and can be recovered via a rest action. However, when you rest (as well as take damage) you begin to 'lose' cards for the rest of the scenario. After you have completely run out of cards, your character becomes exhausted and can no longer participate in the rest of the scenario. So the trick is performing your actions in the most efficient way possible so that you can complete the dungeon before running out of cards. For every attack, you will also draw a card from your 'attack modifier deck', which is the element of randomness in this game. You begin with a preset amount of cards that add/subtract (+2 damage, -1 damage, etc) the amount of damage you deal, but this deck can be altered via leveling up.Setting: The game does a bit of a unique twist on the dungeon crawler genre. While still taking place location-wise in the sorta medieval magic laced location setting, It does away with elves, dwarves, goblins and the other classic tropes, to give you a unique world that FEELS very Tolkien-esk but at the same time gives you a VERY fresh look. Starting characters/races include the Vermling (a humanoid mouse/cat type creature), Humans (of course), an Orchid (mage creatures that are somewhat reminiscent of Asari from Mass Effect), Quatryls (small creatures that are great with mechanical machinations), Saavas (sorta rock men/monsters), and Inox (horned bigfoot with a sword). Not sure what is in store for characters I have yet to unlock, but overall just feels far more fresh and unique than the standards we are all used to in these sorts of games.Leveling up: What would an RPG be without leveling up your character?! As you gain experience you will be able to level up your character. Which allows you to add new, more powerful cards to your hand. You are also allowed to modify your 'attack modifier deck' so that it can become more powerful or add new abilities that can synergize with your team/other cards. And of course, there are tons of items/gear that can be purchased/found to further augment/beef up your character. (I just found a sweet necromancer ring that summons a skeleton!)Components: Components in this game are wonderful. AND you get so freakin much!  The huge box (see picture next to gallon water jug) weighs over 20 pounds (NOT an exaggeration) and comes with tons of stuff, not to mention a wonderful in-box insert that keeps most of the cards/components fairly organized (GREAT design). All playable characters comes with miniatures that are extremely detailed. I am having a blast painting them if you are into that. All monsters have cardboard standees. But don't let that turn you off, the artwork on them is top notch and it really doesn't detract from gameplay/immersion. Each character comes with their own unique hand of cards to use/upgrades to be added. Hundreds of cards (both the small type and magic sized ones). Really can't make a single complaint about anything component-wise.Difficulty: As the game is cooperative, playthroughs are not a cakewalk and do take some thinking. That being said, the game sets monster difficulty based on an equation determined by your average character level. This can further be adjusted to play the scenario on ""easy"" or ""hard"" which affects gold & xp collected. The game doesn't mention this, but I personally say you should start your first few scenarios playing under easy mode, both to get the hang of the game mechanics and so you can get gold to buy gear and such. Otherwise you may find yourself getting stomped around for a bit.I would put this game in a moderate level when it comes to ‚Äòheaviness‚Äô of rules. Definitely NOT something your 6 year old would be able to play. But if you can ‚Äòget‚Äô how to play other dungeon crawling games, you won‚Äôt have any issues with this.Rules: The game has a wonderfully set up/thought out rule book. Reading through it was fairly easy, though it is long (50+ pages), the book contains many picture aides that guide you along your playthrough. After our first couple of sessions (as is typical with these moderately heavy games) we got down the mechanics and no longer/rarely needed to actually consult the rulebook. It is refreshing to find a game with very little holes within the rules which require house-ruling specific circumstances due to ambiguity.Final Thoughts:  Wow! What a great game! My wife and I can't get enough of it and we have only started to scratch the surface of it. After several play sessions (at least 15 hours of gameplay) we are still just as entranced as when we first started, and it is only getting better as we level up. We still haven't retired any characters (expect probably at least 10 dungeons before you retire, though this is just a wild guess, and depending on your personal mission, may take longer/shorter), though I am getting close. The game feels a lot like a first play through of those ‚Äòclassic‚Äô video game RPGs (Elder Scrolls, Dragonage, Witcher, etc) There is just this massive world, all for the exploring. And you quickly find yourself with tons of choices of what to do, what story arcs to explore, etc. There are side quests, loot, leveling up, more side quests, and not to mention an interesting story with branching/intertwining story arcs. My wife and I are always eager to get off on the next mission and the 'choose your own adventure' style of play is very unique, especially when it comes to board games. The game has many unique concepts that I hope future games incorporate.Shadows of Brimstone, I absolutely LOVE YOU, but sorry, won‚Äôt be playing you for a few months while I obsess over my new found love; Gloomhaven.",5.0
4579,B01LZXVN4P,R14BBYNL6O8EL7,"Whether played solo or with a group, you will not be disappointed.","  Don't be daunted by the price (granted it's supposed to retail at $140). This game destroys all other games hands down. The sheer amount of stuff that you get in the box is impressive to the point it's almost ridiculous and it weighs nearly 30 lbs. Fair warning though that it will take you about 2 hours to fully learn the game, not to mention the time to fully get prepared to play your first game from punching out all the assorted enemy standees, tokens and map tiles. Basically don't buy this and expect to open it and be playing within a few minutes.Once you get the rules down pat and have everything sorted and ready to go it is sooooo much fun. You can play the game solo or with a group of up to 4. You start out in the town of Gloomhaven and must take on quests to proceed in the massive story the game book provides. Along the way there are optional side quests you can partake in to get more loot and experience. After each quest whether you succeed or fail, you travel back to town where you can visit the shop to spend your hard earned gold on new equipment and gear, level up your character that you are playing from the experience you gained from the quests, donate to the local church (which gives a benefit) , start a new character AND/OR take part in city events.The town itself has a prosperity level that is raised as you do specific quests. It starts at level 1 and every time it gains a new level more different items get added to the town shop to pick through for purchase. The city events are randomized and they supply an interesting story of something happening in the city that allows you and your group to make a choice on how you want to proceed with the event. The choice you make determines whether something good, bad or neutral happens to your group.This game is LONG. It takes on average 2 hours to complete one quest and there are 98 different quests in the quest book. Mind you that 2 hours is generous, for my group it typically takes about 3 hours per quest as we have much more discussion as we are delving into dungeons. As such the game is made for new people to easily join and drop from playing throughout the game if someone decides they don't want to play anymore. Also there are 6 characters to choose from starting out so if someone doesn't like the character they picked right off the bat, then they can easily switch to a different character once they get back to town.Once you finally get done partaking in the city life you draw a random road event quest card to complete. These basically act just like the city event cards I detailed earlier but with story elements more directed to life on the road. Once that is finished, you start the quest you were traveling to. You open up the quest book and find the current quest and start the setup process. Each quest has a completely different setup and they are all played on modular pieces that make up the game board. Each piece will snap together to form the current dungeon or area and there are doors throughout usually that separate the individual rooms. One of the cool things is, your group doesn't know what lies in wait on the other side of each door until one of you opens it. Then whoever is running the quest book sets up the next room for the party. Also the quest book has very thematic story elements you read as you start the quest and when you open each new door to really set the mood.There is always a specific quest goal that you must complete to beat each quest run, at which point you and your group will gain any number of items. It could be gold, experience, new locations to explore, new gear to be added to the market. All kinds of cool stuff not to mention your progression in the very awesome story. If you lose the quest, you are transported back to town to recover. The good news? You get to keep all the gold and experience you gained from the quest so you don't leave empty handed and feel like you wasted your time. However if you want to proceed in the story and open new locations/quests you must buck up and beat the quest at hand. If the game feels too hard you can easily lower the difficulty of the enemies but be warned that this also lowers the bonus experience and amount of gold you collect from enemies. I would suggest for first time players to play the first couple of quests at the lowest difficulty until you have a good grasp of the play mechanics and rules. Then after that have at it!As far as progression of the game goes, as you defeat locations and quests you will unlock new locations and more quests to take part in. There is another game board that acts as a map of gloomhaven (the town) and its surrounding land. On this gameboard you will keep track of all the locations you have unlocked and beaten via stickers that are included with the game. When you beat a location you check a little box on the sticker with a marker or pen to show you have completed it. And when you unlock a new location you find that location sticker and place it on the gameboard in its specific spot. This is also where you keep track of the towns prosperity level and any global achievements that you have completed. Global achievements are specific things that you and your team have completed during the life of the game and have an effect on the overall story and determine other quests that can be done. There are also party achievements that act in a similar fashion but to a lesser extent.As I said earlier there are 6 characters/classes that you can choose from at the start. When you start the game you randomly choose a character quest card as well. This card has some specific thing you need to complete in the game to unlock it's benefits, such as discovering a new character/class. Because of this there are numerous other characters/classes included with the game that unlock for players as the game progresses. Each character comes with its own mini as well AND each one is in its own little tuckbox so you cannot see what it is. This adds so much excitement to the game. You CRAVE the play just so you can get to the point of opening up the new box and see what's inside. On that point there are numerous other envelopes that are sealed from the onset of the game and are not opened until you completed specific objectives.As far as value goes, the time played to cost ratio is outstanding. At 2-3 hours per quest for 98 quests (plus more online) it will take MONTHS before your group finally beats the game (story). Even longer if you do every single side quest depending on how often you play. Heck, even once you beat the game there is nothing stopping a group from just picking any quest in the quest book and going back and replaying it just for the fun of it. Granted there wont be much point for the gold or story elements as you already traveled that road but for the gameplay it would be worth it. Speaking of gameplay, battling beasts and other critters in the game is very unique. Each character has a specific amount of ability cards in hand each dungeon run. It's different for each character but as an example let's say there are 13.....for each of your turns you play 2 of the cards. Each card has a top and bottom ability that you can use. On the 2 cards you play you pick 1 top and 1 bottom ability to be used, whether it's movement, setting traps, healing, casting spells or just attacking plus more. After you use the cards they either get discarded or ""lost"". Cards generally get lost if they have a decently powerful ability so you can only use it once during a quest and they go in a specific pile next to your character board. The discarded cards go in a diff pile and you can choose a ""rest"" action to collect those back but lose one to the lost pile.Basically as you traverse the dungeon, you will get more and more tired and if you ever ""lose"" all your ability cards and cant rest to get some back, you then become exhausted and have to head back to town, leaving the rest of the party to contend on their own. This creates a very strategic playstyle in where you only use your powerful ""lost"" cards sparingly when you absolutely need them. I love it. Another cool mechanic that I think alot of people miss when they play is that when an enemy attacks you for enough damage to kill you, you can choose to ""lose"" any one of your ability cards in your hand to prevent all that damage.TLDR: This is a game that will keep you occupied for months, possibly years. The sheer amount of content and interesting story creates enough value to keep a group intrigued and wanting to come back for more. Whether played solo or with a group, you will not be disappointed.",5.0
4580,B01LZXVN4P,R1MYAQLG524PVL,A true masterpiece,"  It's hard to describe the awesomeness of this masterpiece. All my friends and family thought I was crazy waiting 7 months after spending over 200 in total for this one game...It was worth the wait.An escape from the digital world, in that fantasy realm, with more detail and lore than even triple A games seem to provide these days.... This game is a true master piece.There was so much planning and consideration put into this game, ensuring that you had content for weeks/months/years to come (varying on how much you play obviously).Balance feels great and provides a sense of challenge.Let me be clear, this isn't your family board game. This game requires dedication, commitment, and enthusiasm. You will spend time on setup and clean up.But, the experience is worth it for any RPG/dungeon crawl fan.If you find the likes of DnD/Pathfinder etc too ""open ended"", you will appreciate this giving you that same friends at a table top experience, but a well defined rule set, where everyone players.And it's your game, so if you want to house rule it to add some openness still... go for it!The only problem I have with this game is that the people I play with don't live with me... :)",5.0
4581,B01LZXVN4P,RDTOHJZMS4SJA,It's awesome and it makes D&D players mad.  Win-win!,"  A fantastically elegant system that literally knocks every board game competitor in the dirt. Components are pretty well made, the quality of construction is quite good. Yes there are a ton of them. Yes the game needs and organizer, badly. Yes the broken token organizer is relatively expensive (but worth it IMO). Guess what! You can put your own system together for about 20 bucks if you have a level of personal motivation that doesn't resemble a porcelain door stop.The mechanics of this game flow smoothly (it is only clunky if you're not so hot in the brainpan department) and the modifier decks are small, easy to handle, and most importantly not in the way of a single thing.I hear a ton of people bashing this game because ""dungeons and dragons."" Well, this game is a LOT more accessible to players than DnD. Given the cost of books and materials with DnD it's probably a lot cheaper to have this in your closet than to ask everyone to go buy their own manuals/dice/minis and then thumb through all 7000 pages of available lore to put something together that works.Also, when was the last time you sat down with your DnD group and got anything meaningful done in less than 5 or 6 hours? Spend a ton of time debating and rules lawyering with your DM pal? DM pal unfairly exercise their blue-bolt and because-i-say-so privileges? That one dude who constantly seduces everything that moves because he has no game in real life? You get 0% of that in this game and guess what! You can STILL roleplay.Yep. All it takes is imagination and a shred of desire.  Every time you pull a card, make a choice, or literally anything happens, you can roleplay all you want.One of my favorite critiques is that the game has cosmetically ""resurfaced"" tired old tropes (thief is now a ""scoundrel"", fighter is a ""brute"") to seem new. Yet that same review will go on to recommend a game that beat those tropes into our brains and hasn't offered anything new in decades except a different way to roll the same old dice and a new opportunity to buy another 400 dollars worth of books.Seriously this game is insanely well done and an absolute achievement in legacy gaming. Characters grow and develop in skills and health, a process you guide. They have motivations in their overall participation and in each scenario. Players can experiment with different characters and it is easy to drop-in, drop-out characters and players throughout the story arc. As the game progresses your decisions and actions have meaningful, formative consequences on the game world.Clocking in with 95 available scenarios with the base game, played on branching story lines, theres enough here to keep you and your pals busy a long time.Yes, you'll want an organizer. Check out YouTube for some great ideas from other players on the cheap. Or, if you have the skrilla, I'd get the previously mentioned organizer. I can set up a game in about 5 minutes now with it.Videos for gameplay reviews and tutorials are plentiful online and more fun than the rule book (which is useful as a reference after the videos). I learned most of the rules watching those and use the book now just for minutiae and double-checking.Two thumbs up.Nobody paid me anything for this review.",5.0
4582,B01LZXVN4P,R53G8ONU91CK2,Lives up to the hype,"  This is the game that every co-op dungeon crawler wants to be: a complete video game in a box. I am completely thrilled and even after playing 85 missions, I want to play more. However, it's not for everyone, and you shouldn't pay upwards of $140 for something that will take up an entire shelf gathering dust, so be careful.Mechanically, Gloomhaven has hundreds of hours of content to uncover (2/3 of the box starts sealed), a pseudo-legacy system where you make steady progress at unlocking the game over those hours, and a remarkably good balance considering how much there is in there. A flexible campaign system lets you add, remove, or swap players, or tune the difficulty without breaking anything. (Start on Easy mode, even the tutorial can be tough for first timers.) There's an innovative and elegant replacement for dice: a set of 20 cards that both you and enemies can modify. There's an innovative and elegant action system: a hand of cards that you slowly spend over time, creating a natural timer that keeps up the urgency in every mission and makes every turn count. There are dozens of enemies, each with a small but unique set of behaviors that adds some randomness. The whole package is polished to a high gloss, gameplay-wise. Even the art is pleasant, with sensible clothes for both genders.However, this is not an RPG in a box. There is little opportunity for roleplaying, and you are forced to retire your characters and start new ones every few sessions (otherwise you would never open most of the box). Nor is there much base building or long-term planning; all that stuff is abstracted to a single good/evil tracker and a single prosperity track, which your actions influence VERY slowly over time. It is a tactical battle-puzzle game first and foremost; you are only ""exploring the wilderness"" in the sense that the mission today calls for a fight against wolves on the forest map tiles.Nor is this a light purchase. It is meant to be played by a hardcore gaming group with lots of free time, because the pace of progress is very slow and each scenario is quite thinky. Even the group that plays Scythe with you may not be thrilled with dedicating 100 hours to a campaign. Because setup and teardown is a beast, solo play takes forever; the additional hands really help get the game started in under 30 minutes. If you have a wife who also loves video games, and another friend or couple that is similarly enthused, that's the optimal way to enjoy this game.The more hardcore you are about Euro/American hybrid games, the more you will like this game. It is a masterpiece of design that, like many such things, is not entertaining to the average gamer, and that's OK. I love it!",5.0
4583,B01LZXVN4P,R3LU7A1SQ26TX5,To many pieces. Good game though.,"  This game is vastly over rated. It's basically just DnD with stickers. Which is fine if you are into that. Except instead of your standard RPG where you have 2 hours of setup at the beginning and then can play for months. You have to do the setup literally every time.The game takes a solid 30-40 minutes to setup the first few games, you do get better at it as you go along now its at about 20 minutes max to setup for my group. Then the game can take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour to play. Then boom you have to redo setup for the next scenario. Every single time. And a solid 20% of the game play is asking ""Hold on... I just saw that piece where did it go?"" because this game comes in a big empty box. No separators, no bags, just your pieces and a half baked sorta separator at the bottom that holds like 6 of the 40 things the game has.Want to cut down on some of that setup time? Well oh boy get ready to drop another 100 dollars on an organizer from a third party that you will spend 6 hours putting together at which point you come on to amazon to share your realization that, This game is just kinda good but not worth all that time and money you just spent.It's on par with other good games, but when you have the honest thought of ""Man I want to play, but it would be way quicker and easier just to pull out Scythe"" you know someone screwed up.Why are there so many pieces. It's not like the different monsters beyond the first 15 really add anything. Who needs 5 different types of demons. It just adds a bunch of unnecessary complexity to the setup so some board game nerd can gush over how much is included.All this doesn't even effect what makes the game good, and that's the card/deck building system. But you don't need 150 card board cutouts and gratuitous decks of one use pseudo-roleplay cards. To have fun in this game. You could literally cut the pieces down by half and have the same experience.That being said, meh solid game you should get it if you like big rules heavy board games. If you don't maybe go pickup a different game.",3.0
4584,B01LZXVN4P,R2910FM0JF9EJY,Amazing game with an enormous amount of content that is a must have for any dungeon crawler/ RPG enthusiast,"  It is typically overpriced here on Amazon, but if you can find a copy under $130.00, and if you have a couple friends who like dungeons and dragons, but don't like the whole talking like an elf part, then this is your game.PROS: It is easily one of the best stand-alone games I have ever played.  My group has only played through about a half dozen dungeons so far and I am thoroughly blown away by how good it is.  The actual game mechanics when you're in dungeons is pretty clever and well designed.  The use of cards instead of dice works very well and always makes every choice you make feel important and satisfying.  The overall campaign is basically a full D&D campaign sprinkled between exciting dungeons.  We played on normal mode, and each time we completed a dungeon it felt like we just barely completed it.  Choices you make in town or on the road have actual consequences that last the entirety of the campaign and can lead to different paths for different groups.  If you like painting the character models that come with it are pretty well detailed and are a pleasure to paint as well.  It is a game with so much content that i can see my group playing off and on over the course of a year (or more).CONS: It is an $$expensive$$ game that takes a long time to set up, a long time to play, and a long time to pick up.  Also, punching out all the content out of the cardboard takes a long time.  Storage is also an issue - there is so much stuff that fitting it all in the box it came in can pose a challenge (although there are companies that make really good solutions to this... but they can be pricey)..Overall it is an amzing game that will give you somewhere around 100 hours of playable content.  The dungeon gameplay is deep and rewarding and a pleasure to play, and the campaign story ties it all together in a fun ""choose your adventure"" style system where you and your group of friends can forge your own somewhat unique path.",5.0

The fighting mechanics are so well balanced, especially if you pay attention to the nuances of the rules in fights.  It has taken a few scenarios to really get down all the little things but it is well worth it.I think the only minor issue I've had so far is that my Scoundrel miniature came out of the box unnaturally bent backwards and it is a bit flimsy, I fear it may soon break off at the knees.  Even with this issue I can't dock it any points, it is just too well designed and has an amazing ability to keep my attention captured.",5.0

4587,B01LZXVN4P,R143E1T8XN0LI0,really great... if you like that kind of thing,"  It's hard to summarize a review for this game, because some things are really great and others are absolutely terrible.GOOD- The general concept of a highly modular dungeon crawler game with a Legacy-style persistent world and a novel style of tactical combat is a good one- Beautiful artwork- With certain reservations, the card-based combat system is both very fresh and very fun- The amount of content included is mind-blowing. I've heard some groups got over 200 hours of play out of the base set, and I believe themBAD- My friends and I like board games, but anyone who is not an ultra-hardcore gamer need not apply here. The rules are very, very, very complex and detailed. Unless you watch like a hawk you can regularly expect to forget to draw cards or apply effects or alter your damage calculations when you are technically supposed to, which makes it very frustrating if you want to play correctly and not cheat.- It takes FOREVER to set up, especially the first few rounds. Block off at least an hour for your first game to do this. Overall the ratio of time spent setting up/taking down to playing is probably the worst I've ever seen.- The theme is meh. Pretty generic fantasy stuff, with a Warcraft-style option to be ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" even though both plot threads play out pretty similarly. Because you can pick your characters, it means your characters don't actually get to grow or evolve (except for their stats) or have arcs of their own, as far as the game's plot is concerned you will always be just a gang of generic mercenaries with a ""Reputation"" score and not much else.- The box weighs like 25 lbs and is a pain to carry around.- Personally I thought the combat gets kind of same-y and static over time, especially since you only get one new card per level (and it takes several sessions to level up). You're basically using the same set of ~10 cards over and over and over.I respect what the designers were going for, but I think they went too far on the side of adding mechanics and complexity to the point that the game became unwieldy and flawed. They almost should've made it a computer game if they wanted this level of detail. But if you are willing to put in a lot of time dealing with the rules, I could see a group of hardcore gamers having fun with this one.",3.0
4588,B01LZXVN4P,R1G9BWL4DGXX3L,"Great game, but prepare for setup/tear-down","  I love this game.  It's an awesome mixture of my 4 favorite game types (role-playing, euro, deck building, and strategy) in one seamless well thought out system.  The price point seemed high when I bought it, but after receiving the box, I understand the cost.  It's about 17 - 18 lbs of cardboard punchouts, plastic figurines, and decks of cards.  The quality of the components are good too.  There's a giant and still growing community of players with websites and video channels to address any playthrough questions you may have also.  I realy only have 2 complaints and both of those are addressed with aftermarket solutions.First, this game is so massive it can take about 45 minutes to set up (before play time) and another 30 or so in teardown (add 20 more minutes if you separate things out like I do).  The game was in bad need of an organisation system, and a few companies have provided them.  Do a search and you'll see the options.Second, it's not designed for multiple playthroughs.  The game is written with the intention of the players marking on the board and making permanent changes.  Let's be honest, there's enough scenarios that almost no one will play through 1 complete time more less multiple times, but I do see the possibility for different groups to play through on the same set.  Again, luckily someone has a vinyl sticker set that also has a record sheet so you can make any permanent marks on the record sheet, and place the sticker on the board with multiple playthroughs.",4.0
4589,B01LZXVN4P,R2XZSZQ2NJ67TX,Overhyped,"  Tried playing it on lvl 1, 2 players w/2 characters. A road condition made us lose 3 health each. Ok. We lost the very first scenario the first time we played. Figured it was newness to the gameplay, didn't manage cards right, so we restarted, and played it again on lvl 0. Won it, barely. We looted the treasure chest with a ""prize"" of ""new random scenario"". That opens some random thing on the map. Well, that's a bit trash. I wanted a reward that, I dunno, maybe make things easier? More interesting??? but we got nothing. A few gold, but not enough to even go back to town to get potions.We moved on to scenario 2, bandit commander opens all the doors right away and summons 2 skeletons, so we have to fight/kill everything. Spellweaver fails to hit things because curse cards, summoned living bones heals, she's left with one card, so she's exhausted, and runs out. Brute exhausted. Lvl 0 elite zombies with 10 health each left. Scenario failed at lvl 0.We have to do that whole thing again??? Seriously??? NO.Gloomhaven has received high praise and glowing reviews... it's why I bought it and was excited to play, but ended up finding very little enjoyment in its stiff, complicated rules. I don't know who this was made for but it's not for me.By the way, I've played & DM'd D&D 5th edition, I have dozens of rule books and adventures, and I've set up my own adventures as well as playing the given ones verbatim. I didn't get anything out of playing Gloomhaven except that there's no way me, as a working person with an actual job, is going to waste another half-dozen hours or so trying to get through scenario 2 at lvl 0.If anyone else is looking for better co-op games after being disappointed by this one, even ones with complicated rules, AND ones that still feel rewarding when you lose, then try these:Eldritch Horror--great game, even though the rules can get complicated, lost loads of times but still fun. Mansions of Madness--same deal, complicated, but there's an app that randomizes elements so you can play them again later, but you never lose, you just make it to the 'end' and get a good story from it. Dead of Winter--end of the world with zombies, there's co-op rewards, etc, not my fav but it's better than Gloomhaven.",1.0
4590,B01LZXVN4P,RPX07L3VT71U1,Missing pieces mar an otherwise good game.,"  The game itself is well designed and fun to play.The missing pieces are aggravating.  Initially I noticed I was missing a complete punchboard of pieces and requested a replacement from the manufacturer's website.  Due to the nature of the game you gradually open content, which also means you gradually discover even more missing pieces.  I later discovered that one of the character decks was missing a card and requested a replacement.  I then discovered that one of the miniature boxes held the wrong miniature, leaving me with a duplicate for one character and missing another, and I requested a replacement.All of this would be OK if the replacements arrived in a timely manner.  But I have been waiting 6 weeks and haven't seen a thing.  Apparently this is a typical experience and replacements take many months.  In the meantime I have been working around the missing pieces by substituting other pieces or printing things out myself on cardstock.  This would have been OK for a cheaper game, but I expected better from a game that lists at $140.  I won't be buying another game from Cephalofair.---Update: I finally received the replacements, a little over 10 weeks after my initial request.  On the plus side, it also included the parts I had requested later (7 weeks ago and 6 weeks ago).  I realize that with a game as complicated a Gloomhaven there are bound to be a few problems.  Faster response and/or better communication from Cephalofair would have gone a long way towards making this a more positive experience.",3.0

If you want to spend all night setting up the game and explaining the rules constantly this is your game.  If you want to juggle multiple decks of cards, tokens, and effects for everything that does anything this is your game.

4592,B01LZXVN4P,R19HS7CSPUJXIX,"Ok, but way overrated.","  This game is reasonably fun, but has its downsides, and is way overrated.The set up time to play is large. There are a million fiddly little pieces.  Unless you have a large table to devote to it, I wouldn't bother.The board itself is pointless.  All it does is serve as a place to put stickers that show what scenarios you've unlocked.  Might as well just have a list.Character classes vary widely in terms of fun-ness.  Almost none of them are tanky, that we've found so far.  (Oh look, another damage dealing caster or rogue type.)  Survivability is all about killing monsters before they hit you, stunning them, or cheezing them.  (Ex: Invisibility in doorway so they cant get through)Some rules need work.  Summons in particular are lame.  If they can't see an enemy, they dont move, leading to them falling behind.Armor/shielding is pointless for characters and good for enemies.  Enemies can have armor (shielding) that provides from 1 to 3 damage mitigation every attack.  Characters can buy a shield that provides 1 point of mitigation one time...Leveling seems inconsistent.  Some of our classes have an easier time of it than others.  Get stuck playing a bad/boring class?  Prepare to play about 12 to 15 games before you can retire it.  (Yes, I know you can abandon it and make a new character, but then you're playing something that was in the starting set or that the group has played before.)Random events are frustrating and uneven.

The box was well-packaged, and came without bend corners or scratches.If you enjoy dungeon-crawling, leveling up fantastically nuanced characters and an immersive story-driven experience, and are fine with a great deal of admin and a hefty price tag, this game is for you.

Don't be. The rule reference book is one of the best I've seen with great visual identifiers for components, rules that are well written and easy to remember, and fantastic organization of concepts and mechanics of the game.Speaking of mechanics, this game strikes an uncommon balance of tactical planning and spontaneity. The perfect plan can be foiled by an enemy moving before or after when you had hoped they would do so, but the top/bottom function of the action cards allows for last minute changes in strategy. The scenario's (I've played three so far) are of a satisfying length that never seemed too short or long and are certainly challenging (if you choose them to be) enough to satisfy a gaming veterans need for some real close calls.In the end the campaign appears to be the real deal for folks that are on board with spending many, MANY, hours in a game that has secrets (sealed envelops, unrevealed characters, etc.), remarkable combat, outstanding art, and easy to follow rules and scenarios.

4598,B01LZXVN4P,RS0Q1JD0T4C3N,There is a LOT to this game,"  This is a great (mostly) cooperative board game. Individual play sessions are fun, but what is really done well is the way the game grows and changes as you play. I have only played 4 times so far, but its already beginning to show its promise.Price: Yes it is expensive. Yes it is worth it. There is a LOT to this game. You don't need to worry about buying expansions, you will be playing this for a long time. You and your friends will WANT to play this game a lot. You will probably buy a few other things to help organize it (see below)Gameplay: It says 30 minutes per player. Maybe if you use apps and tools to help you can get that fast. Plan on 45 minutes per player, and plan on 1 hour per player for your first 1-2 games. It plays well, but somewhat differently with 2, 3, or 4 characters. You will eventually fine tune your play style and tactics to match your choices and number of players.Note that setup & take down time are IN ADDITION to the game play time above. Depending on how you store it, and how many of the components you replace with the use of apps setup and take down range from ~5 minutes each, to 30 minutes or so each (1 hour total)What else you will need/want:Some sort of organization is a MUST HAVE. There are a LOT of options out there, from ziplock bags, to fishing tackle type boxes, to expensive custom storage tools. You can spend $5 to >$100. If you have a side table or somewhere you can let the pieces spread out and stay for a while, I recommend playing a few times before you buy something. I bought lots of card sleeves and trays but now that we are using apps for some stuff I probably could have used different storage options. Similarly I bough dice to track monster hitpoints (using the damage tokens is really slow) but with the apps I dont need them.Stands. The Spiel Pro ones (white and gold) are excellent, and low priced. Get them, the 1 thing that comes with the game that is terrible.Apps: There are lots of free ones. The makers of the game have a list on the website. There are ones that replace the scenario book (to keep you from peeking ahead), ones to track your campaign for you, and ones to streamline gameplay. The gameplay ones can really make the game faster and let you keep dozens of card decks for the monsters in the game. Play 1-2 times without any apps, then try something like Gloomhaven Helper (free for android or PC). Without the apps 1 player does a lot of ""admin"" type work while playing... with the app its greatly reduced.So buy the game. Even after you buy storage and stands it will come out to $1-2 per time you will play the game... because you will play it a lot.",5.0
4599,B01LZXVN4P,R325E3O1S4P8FZ,"Incredible experience, with additional purchases required.","  Gloomhaven delivers a fantastic tabletop game experience provided the player group is committed to investing vast amounts of time to get the most out of it.However, the game really is not complete as it is delivered in the box, and some crucial investments are frankly mandatory if one wants to have a great experience.Firstly, it requires an unprecedented level of parts organization.  I've never experienced a board game that contains the number of pieces (and categories of pieces) that Gloomhaven delivers.  You would need a passion for misery if you tried to organize all of this with just the materials in the box.  I would suggest a number of plastic tackle boxes to organize the hundreds of cardboard pieces used in this game.  I actually utilize a drawer of a filing cabinet to keep all the large map tiles straight and easily accessible for scenario setup.Secondly, one will absolutely need a phone or tablet available to access a 3rd party app that will manage all the character and monster statuses that will be in play in any given session.  Using the analog system included in the box is manageable in the early days, but as the game develops this becomes a literal accounting nightmare.This is not the kind of game you can just pull off the shelf and have a good go at it with uninitiated friends.  Expect a newcomer to need a good six hours of exposure at least to come to grips with the genius of this game and begin to truly enjoy themselves.In short, a gamer (or group) needs to approach Gloomhaven as a hobby with all the commitment a hobby entails to get the most out of this experience.  In the end, I believe it's very much worth it if you can make such an investment.",4.0
4600,B01LZXVN4P,R2DC2VUH1XF57G,Incredible!,"  Really can't recommend this game enough. Do you want to be a psychic rat that stabs and mind controls your enemies? How about an outcast rock elemental that slams his enemies through things? What about a mechanized gnome with bombs, traps and a flamethrower?Gloomhaven is heavy, theres a lot of components and its -very- long but if you're looking for the perfect blend between a video game rpg, a deck building board game and d&d, this is it. While there's a lot to it, theres never too much, the game concepts are handled so elegantly that really anyone can pick it up with some practice and there's plenty of helper apps on the app store to help with token and character management. You can play solo using two characters at a time or with a group of up to four, no dungeon master required but plenty of immersion just the same.The game is a string of chosen scenarios many of which you won't or can't see in one play through which are strung together by a simple narrative and random event cards that impact the world and add flavor to your adventure. Each time you unlock a new scenario you add a sticker to the 'world map' board, allowing you to explore somewhere new. After awhile your characters 'retire' unlocking a new class, of which there are 20'ish I believe. Persistent character levels, item cards, ability cards and ability upgrades allow you to grow more powerful and customize to your hearts content as the adventure unfolds.I'm blown away by the world building and just how darn fun it is to play this game. Every scenario has you visiting somewhere new, making unique choices and fighting something new and in a way where you thought you were good and knew how to play, then you get slapped in the face and have to try again. You're looking at over 100 hours of choose your own adventure, build your own character and get lost in this world goodness.

4601,B01LZXVN4P,R53GFN7X43239,RNG - The Game!,"  Wow! A game that is completely unoriginal that uses DND as a bases and tries desperately to mimic them while boosting replay-ability! Not sure why this needed to start as a kickstarter considering it's just a bunch of printed materials that copied an already existing game by replacing dice with cards. But the real kicker to this game is that you need those cards to do anything at all. Ten cards sometime 8, to complete an entire scenario. You thought the fun of the game was defeating enemies? Nope. It's micromanaging your cards and inventory down to one single efficient playstyle that everyone uses. You thought there would be variety in a game with 14 classes? Nope. Go look at guides right now if your interested. Everyone plays the same class the same way due to how horribly the game is balanced. Some items and ability cards are just flat useless, forcing you to learn the hard way or eventually look it up. Every monster in the game has 8 ability cards and 2 critical moves of which you draw from randomly to determine the monsters turn. You can already tell that this will end horribly right? You often just draw the same move over and over. And if it couldn't get worse, guess what? On that critical move, you MUST reshuffle, and might just grab it again. I have faced groups of enemies, scenario after scenario that just did the same move. I didn't even know the monster had other moves, until I looked. Sometimes these are good moves, sometimes the monster just stands there doing nothing giving you a free kill. I mean I really don't know what they were thinking there. You could have given the monsters two extra moves and we would have MUCH better chances of not drawing the same thing. (About 4/8 monster cards are the same with slight variation anyways.) However the worst thing, is the RNG. Imagine rolling a dice that has a 0 on it. Sound fun, or dynamic? Well now imagine rolling a dice with MULTIPLE 0's. That's right, some scenario's FORCE you to add some 0's to your deck. Some conditions ADD 0's to your deck. If that isn't the most blatant replayability boost I've ever seen, I don't know what is. The reason for the bad review score however, is entirely for being so unoriginal. This game is DND without the roleplay and cards instead of dice. That's it. The monster moves are bland and repetitive and mostly similar, and that's IF you get to see them. Some enemies require some tactics but the meta doesn't change, blow up everyone as quick as possible. The small amount of lore in this game is nice but because there's is no RP and the game is mostly combat you never really notice that anyways. The game is presented well and the rules are easy enough to understand but it's funny how little all your strategy matters when your hit with constant 0 pulls. At that point every single game is ""Boy I hope I get the RNG I need to win."" Now try explaining all of these negative things to three of your buddies as they suffer through it with you. There's a reason why there are so many used edition's of Gloomhaven floating around.",1.0
4602,B01LZXVN4P,RZNQJ4IOJQCFX,"Amazing game, but only if you are willing to learn through harsh trial and error","  I'll keep the review short. For some background, I've played D&D (various editions) on and off for the past 12 years. I'm very familiar with following peculiar RPG rules. Gloomhaven, built upon a deeply intricate automated system for monster AI, has an extremely harsh learning curve. There are so so many little things that after even 50+ hours of game time in, there were still occasionally times that I had to say, ""We've been doing this wrong the whole time."" And, unfortunately, doing even something minor wrong can sometimes really mess with the difficulty. For example, if you're making a monster move to a space where it shouldn't have, it can increase or decrease how often they are able to hit players with attacks. And, to be clear, doing something just slightly wrong is incredibly easy! While there is virtually always a definitive answer to every solution, look no further than the ""The Gloomhaven Rules Quiz"" on boardgamegeek to see the insane amount of comments debating the accuracy (or the confusing nature) of nearly every single scenario presented in the quiz. Monsters don't always move intuitively or intelligently, which can lead to a case of you moving a monster somewhere that does make sense but, again, may be only slightly incorrect but with potentially a large amount of effect on the gameplay.When all is said and done, I ADORE this game and I'll be buying the big new expansion coming out early 2020 as soon as possible, but it is truly difficult to RECOMMEND this game to anyone without an insane list of conditions. As long as you know what you're in for, it is absolutely worth the buy.",5.0
4603,B01LZXVN4P,R2TP6PAZK5J9UL,Great game but a bit fiddly,  This would be my favorite game if building each dungeon didn't take as long. I would have preferred more like 4-6 generic map tiles and generic creature standees for speed of play. I played the first two scenarios without any helper apps to get a feel for it and I would say that they are pretty much required to keep the session time down and the enjoyment up. I still recommend your first scenario you do without helper apps and the second you do managing on the board and in app so can make sure everything in the app is setup correctly. You will probably want something to manage the monster cards and health to clear table space and If you care about spoilers you will probably want to use a scenario viewer so you can't see rooms you haven't explored yet. If you plan on playing with multiple groups or parties you'll need an app to save your progress for one of those groups.All of my experience has been with a 3 person party but difficulty seems about right. We usually beat a scenario in 1 to 2 attempts and usually only fail because someone's battle goal is disadvantageous for us or from selfish play in general like trying to get xp or gold over optimal play.That said this is by far the most interesting game I've played. All the little mechanics are fantastic and nothing seems forced into the game play. I will say watching videos providing details and recommendations for your first scenario will help you tremendously. Even googling recommended house rules will help you understand some mechanics better.Overall I'm very happy I took the plunge and bought this game. I feel like its good value for money. My only real complaint is more so about time spent not playing the game like finding map tiles to applying stickers. Once you are playing its a lot of fun.,5.0
4604,B01LZXVN4P,RXP4JTMSS9349,It's a great game but it has a few serious flaws.,"  This game is basically dungeons and dragons converted into a board game.  The developers did a really good job accounting for all of the things you need to think about to accomplish this.  If you like DND you'll love this game.  If you don't like DND or have never played it then this is still a great board game.  However, there are some things you need to know going in.First, there are a lot of pieces and rules with this game.  You'll need several hours to read the instructions, punch out all the cardboard pieces and organize all the cards.You need to know going in that it is a very strategic game.  There are a couple ways to lose (become exhausted).  The obvious way is your character reaches zero hit points or life.  The other is to run out of ability cards before you complete your objective.  This requires a lot of strategy on your part. Once you figure it out the game is a lot of fun.  To really get everything out of the game I recommend playing with four players.Now the bad stuff IMO.  First the instructions are poorly done.  This game is complicated but that is no excuse for how poorly written the instructions are.  I promise you no one has EVER played this game correctly without reading numerous FAQ or watching hours of youtube videos.  Anyone who says they never need to consult FAQ or watch a video is either playing the game wrong or a liar.  The fact that there are so many FAQ should be a big clue to the developers that the instructions need a serious overhaul.Secondly,(this is just my opinion) there is a quest / puzzle within the game that is insanely difficult to complete.  To solve it you need to play the entire game, unlock all the sealed envelopes and characters, study each piece of the game with a magnifying glass, decipher encrypted messages, have internet access to find developers discussion admitting to a typo in the puzzle that makes it impossible to solve otherwise, solve an anagram, and then you'll get your big prize.  Now the prize is pretty cool but the amount of work you need to put into solving this thing is stupid.  Not only that but when you get the prize you have to take it somewhere and spend money to actually get it.  The prize should be included so once it's solved you contact the developer and they send it to you but it's not.  I know the developer put a lot of work into creating the puzzle and made it difficult on purpose.  But it's dumb.  There are links on the net that will save you dozens of hours and frustion and provide you with the answer to the puzzle and I recommend using them.  However, once you do you still have to spend $$ and involve a 3rd party to get the prize.Due to the poor instructions and the insanity of the puzzle I give the game 3 ***.  I hope future additions come out with better instructions and the puzzle prize should at least be available for purchase from the developer once solved.",3.0
4605,B01LZXVN4P,R2DP5EWPE0YPAO,So many rules it is like doing homework,"  If you have a group of gamers that usually plays D&D, but no one wants to actually run the campaign, this might be a good choice for you.  But, if you are looking to just chill and play a game, this is not it.  You basically have to stop every four seconds to check the rulebook, or to check the 50 pages of FAQs online that try and help explain the rulebook, or check one of the 100 videos online to help explain the FAQs.Admittedly, most of the people I play with are halfway drunk or high when we play, leaving me to manage 500 rule actions every turn, but if it was written more clearly it wouldn't be such a chore.  Note to mention, if you lose a match, you have to spend 3 hours playing it over, which is a huge drag.For Legacy games, I recommend Betrayal Legacy instead, it's faster paced and more engaging, and keeps moving even if you lose.",3.0
4606,B01LZXVN4P,RCYR3URR0V337,Great game with poor support for missing parts,"  I would easily give the game a five star in a bubble. No questions asked. It really is that good.The problem is that the game came missing parts. Some of this was discovered immediately and some not until a couple months later with legacy content unlocks, and the company has not replaced the missing items in over two months of waiting.  I highly recommend having a veteran player check through your materials to ensure they aren't missing anything if you buy a copy",3.0
4607,B01LZXVN4P,RC0MF4EY1KVTI,Will give hundreds of hours of enjoyable play,"  This is one of the top-rated games, all-time, at various online sites that rate boardgames, and it is well-worth it. My son and I will get hundreds of hours of play from it, if not several hundred, so though it is an ""expensive"" board game, if one measures $ per hour of enjoyment, it is probably very ""inexpensive"".There are tons of pieces and cards and things to keep track of. Much of that I am tracking using various free or very cheap apps available online or as iOS apps. Now that we are using digital tools to help us play, some of the components will sit in the box (forever) doing nothing, so the manufacturer would do some people a favor to make a version of the game that intentionally is missing some components and is cheaper. The digital tools make set up (and take down) of the game much, much faster.Another idiosyncratic feature of the game that I don't like is that the 40 or so map tiles have labels that are not easy to read (i.e. the printing does not contrast well with the art). So it would have been great if the labels were easier to read: I would rather have a slight distraction from the aesthetics of the art to allow me to set each scenario up more quickly. Also, there is no reason why the maps have to have a strange labeling system. There are several maps whose labels start with ""A"", several that start with ""B"", some with ""C"", etc., Sometimes there is one map for a letter. Sometimes up to 4. If the maps were clearly labeled from 01 to 40 (or however many maps there are), I could more easily set up the game.But at this point, I guess the creator of the game is stuck: changing the labels would mean having to change the ""scenario"" book, creating confusion.",5.0

The quality is outstanding.  From the Eggs, to the box to even the rule book, everything is of premium components.  StoneMaier Games knocks this one out of the park!Edit:The game is currently sold out, but there are more printings on the way with the first batch available in Mid April.

4639,B07MC9JN56,RXPQ5QQICJGP7,Bird Paradise of Glory,"  1-5 players, Competitive, Engine Building Bird ParadiseOverview of Gameplay-In Wingspan you need to build a build empire. However there are many different ways to build said empire. You could place high value birds on your player mat to gather points or you could place low valued birds that have better synergies with other birds. There are eggs you can lay on your birds that are worth points or some of your birds can gather food up or even devour other birds. In short there are a lot of ways to gain points in this game and finding that perfect strategy may not be as easy as it sounds‚Ä¶.So to play the game is actually really simple. On your turn you place one of your colored wooden cubes on a specific spot on your player board and take the action that is there. The actions are: Play a bird, Gain food, Lay eggs and draw card. That‚Äôs it. The key is to play in such a method that the bird madness you create on your board all works together fluidly. Because as you start playing birds on your board, depending on what row you play them in, those actions become more powerful. So let‚Äôs say you have a couple birds already played to the forest row, well now when you perform the ‚ÄúGain Food‚Äù action you can gain two food instead of the one food like everyone starts with.What makes it more tactical though is that you are constrained by your starting birds. At the very beginning each player is dealt 5 random bird cards and 1 of each of the 5 food tokens and you can keep however many of those cards you want at the cost of 1 food each. Not only that but each player is dealt 2 objective cards and has to choose just one to keep. So right off the bat you have to make a choice on how you want to proceed building your bird engine based on what you have in hand. It‚Äôs an interesting choice for sure, and for the life of me every game I‚Äôve played it hasn‚Äôt been about winning. It‚Äôs always been about something super specific that a particular person had on their mind. A couple examples, my wife played and in her starting hand was this Horned Owl that looks all devious. Now she loves owls so I can only imagine the glee in her bones when she had this card. The ONLY thing in her mind was that she HAD to play this card regardless of the cost. Now I believe the cost on that particular Owl was 3 rats. Of the 5 different foods that can be gained rats are are one of the most rare. Also there are precious few birds in the large deck that eat rats so you don‚Äôt see them come up all that often compared to the others. So she spent a very large portion of the game trying to gather up enough rats to play this beast. She finally did and she was pleased, however it cost her the game. But that didn‚Äôt matter at that moment, she accomplished her goal that she created from the get go.In another instance I was playing a 5 player game with some friends and one of my buddies got it in his mind that he wanted to find the Pigeon card in the deck. So he built this incredible ‚ÄúDraw Card‚Äù bird engine that when combined with bird cards that he played had him drawing up 11 bird cards every turn. At the end of the game he came in 4th on points and never did find that pigeon (there isn‚Äôt one in the game) but the amount of fun he had hunting was glorious. That game in particular also showed me so many different ways you can build up your bird engine and was an interesting experiment on different strategies. In any case I‚Äôve dolled on long enough, onward with the review!Components/Game board ‚ÄìThis is one of those games that goes far above and beyond when it comes to component quality. Before I purchased the game for myself I had played a friends copy and got the honor of touching his rulebook. My gawd. These rulebooks are heavenly. The pages feel like‚Ä¶like‚Ä¶what you imagine a cloud must feel like when you were six years old. The softness and texture is out of this world. The cards also have a lovely texture to them, the oversized wooden dice have custom images emblazoned on the sides and roll perfectly down a custom made bird house dice tower that also feel very sturdy. There is a plastic storage holder that doubles as the card draw for the cards that has an image of a bird on it. I mean the ONLY things in the game that I would even consider average are the wooden action cubes and the cardboard food tokens and even those look very nice on the table. Oh and the plastic eggs! A whole fat batch of plastic eggs that you use in the game that adds an immense amount of theme.The player boards are also super high quality. They fold in half and have a kind of soft smooth textured touch to them. It‚Äôs hard to put into words until you feel of them yourself‚Ä¶..especially those rulebooks. Anyway as far as components go this game shot straight to the top for me. Super high quality and attention to detail with every aspect.Box/Storage ‚ÄìThe box also has a nice feel to it as well, it just feels premium. And it‚Äôs not all that big either when compared to most modern games. I would say a little smaller than average. And even though it doesn‚Äôt come with a proper insert, everything fits in the box almost perfectly. Now this is the way to measure and pack a game box. There is even a diagram on the inside lip of the box that shows you how to pack the box. There are a few plastic containers that allow you to store the tokens though which is nice. The big storage aspect though is the plastic card holder. This baby stores all the cards and has a nice lid to keep them all nice and organized. Beyond all that though you will bag up the rest of the stuff such as the eggs and dice. For a game without a full insert I was pleasantly surprised at how well everything came together in the box.Visual Appeal /Theme‚ÄìAnother aspect that they just knocked out of the park with this game. The game is gorgeous with a variety of colors all over the player boards. And not just the player boards either, the plastic eggs are all colored differently as well as the food tokens and player action cubes. Visually this game just draws people in when they get a glimpse of it, it stands out. Now I remember when this game was first announced, the theme was to me, uninteresting. I remember thinking, ‚Äúbirds? Meh‚Äù. Oh how wrong I was to dismiss this game just because of the theme. After having played it I can say the way the bird theme integrates with the game mechanics and how interesting it is to see some birds synergizing with others is just awesome. Strictly speaking just because of this game, I will never judge a game solely on its theme alone again.In any case they did an outstanding job with the bird cards. Heck even if you are not a bird lover, the little bits of bird knowledge on each card is fun to read! Plus some of the bird names are just hilarious. It never fails to bring a smile from the groups I play with when I flip a new bird card and read its name aloud along with the nice little bird fact.Rulebook ‚ÄìOh don‚Äôt even get me started rn. These 3 rulebooks included with this game are‚Ä¶..unbelievable. And in such an amazing way. I mean honestly I am at this moment having a hard time even remembering the rules‚Ä¶..it‚Äôs almost like once I touch the softness of the pages my mind is whisked away to an enchanted forest where only the softest of trees grow and tiniest fuzzballs of birds dwell. Snapping back into existence, the rules are written out easy to read with plenty of examples and even still there really isn‚Äôt much to explain as the game is so straight forward as it is. But I don‚Äôt recall ever wondering about a specific rule and I haven‚Äôt had to come to the forums in search of a rules question which is always a good sign.I mentioned 3 rulebooks up there ^. There is the regular book to explain the game, an appendix book that goes over all the finer details (which I have never needed to use) and a solo Automa rulebook which explains how to play the solo game. The solo game is super fun and unique and I‚Äôll delve into that more in the player count section below. All in all though the rulebook/s are great!Table Talk/Fun Factor ‚ÄìThe game is played on your own personal player board as there is no group board to play upon so you do find yourself focusing on your own devices a lot more than worrying about others. That said, at least with the groups I play with, we always seem to keep conversation going about the game while we play. We are always talking about the different birds we find and I typically handle the draw pile for everyone around the table and read aloud the new birds with their little tidbit of intriguing info. It goes a long way to keeping everyone engaged and not only that but people always seem interested in strategies that everyone else is doing.I always ask my groups how they like the games we play every week and every single person enjoyed this one. They all said the same thing too, they loved all the different ways you could try to win by gaining points.Optimal Player Count/Replayability ‚ÄìI think this game wins in a number of different player counts. Solo is a blast as the game comes with a dedicated automa solo mode complete with its own cards and instructions. I enjoyed all my plays solo and am itching to play it as we speak. 2-5 player is super fun as well however I did see some downtime during the 5 player games I played. The downtime wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as some games I‚Äôve played in the past but it‚Äôs something to be aware of.Replayability is pretty good for the most part. There are 150-ish different bird cards in that large deck so more than likely you will not see ALL the birds for quite some time. So each new game you play you can try out new strategies depending on what birds you collect/draw. That said it‚Äôs the same game mechanics over and over of playing birds, collecting food, drawing cards, laying eggs. The variety comes from HOW you choose to build your engine.Positive Final Thoughts ‚ÄìIf you are looking for a great engine building style of game with loads of theme and color then look no further. Even if you are not a fan of birds in general the gameplay mechanics are a hoot. With the amount of variety of the different birds and ways you can try to win this game will keep you occupied for a very good long time. Not only that but the component quality is off the charts, and for the love of relish you NEED to feel these rulebooks omg.Negative Final Thoughts ‚ÄìI wish there was a pigeon. Also the game isn‚Äôt crazy deep so if you are looking for a complex strategy game or a brain burner then this isn‚Äôt it. There are card synergies you can play but that‚Äôs about as deep as this game gets. Also the end game seems a little lopsided, what I mean is that it seems like everyone always leans towards laying eggs for those easy points during the 4th and last round. Since there isn‚Äôt as much time to play actions during the last round due to having only 5 action cubes (when compared to 8 in the first round as you lose 1 action cube each round) players seem to all agree that laying eggs during the last round is the best course of action.",5.0
4640,B07MC9JN56,R99XP2UPUUXV2,Favorite game in years,"  This game is beautiful and so much fun to play. We have been counting down the days for its arrival since we played it at a friend's house a couple months ago (then INSISTED that we be invited back to play again). It's one of those games where, even when you lose, the concept and execution is so wonderful that you enjoy playing. If you can snag this for the retail price, _run_ don't walk to get this.The game is not super simple, so if you're playing with the young/inexperienced/daft, this may be difficult at first for them to pick up. But the theming is so gorgeous that I think it will appeal to people who aren't traditional board game geeks. It's also not so complicated that it will take two hours to set up and explain, like some games.The game is not vicious - on the margin, you can harm another player intentionally. But, for the most part, you're doing your own thing on your own board. That's good if you're playing with sensitive types. There's also a decent amount of luck, with the card drawing. I like luck, because it means that new players can win.Other game makers - please make games this beautiful in other genres!! I want more like Wingspan.

The build quality is stunning - dice roller, plenty of bags and boxes to hold everything (no need for special wooden organizers really), pieces, and even the quality of the paper stock used in the rules is head and shoulders above typical fare.There is surprising depth for a game about birds, with multiple possible ways to win.  Once you do a few turns the game pace is pretty steady.Overall highly recommended and probably the best game of this sort since Gloomhaven, and it appeals to a wider audience.  Great add to any collection and worth every penny.",5.0
4642,B07MC9JN56,R2U75MYBE0FYZV,"High Quality, Great Game.","  The artwork for this game is phenomenal. (You can actually order prints via a link provided on the info page of the game on StoneMaier's website). The components are all high quality. I would have preferred for the game to come with wooden resource tokens, but if you desire, those can be acquired through MeepleSource. I thoroughly enjoy Gizmos and other engine building games and this is a great one. I like how you can decide if you want round scoring to be directly competitive or indirectly competitive. If you are looking for a multiplayer game that can also be played solo, this game has an ""Automa"" designed for the game.The game comes with small token trays to contain pieces. I was not expecting this and was a nice touch. Nothing fancy, just super useful.At first I thought the theme would not appeal to me, but my mind was quickly changed after diving into it. You can tell  how much time was put into the research of each bird on the 170 bird cards.Anyways, I will have to play more games of this before giving a proper critique. But initially I find this game beautiful and charming, with a great use of engine-building mechanics and an abundance of quality components.My ""belongs in my gaming library"" score at this time is a:  5 out of 5 Bird Eggs",5.0
4643,B07MC9JN56,R1OUUW7WX8T8YF,Wonderful lightly-strategic game!,"  Beautiful game! It has high quality components, wooden eggs in different colors, slightly oversized wooden dice, and more! This is a wonderful game, even for people who aren't really into board games. It is light on strategy, but very creative and fun!  Overview of gameplay: each player is establishing their own bird sanctuary, trying to attract a variety of birds to move in and lay eggs by providing them with their desired food. The game is played over the course of 4 rounds, each with their own bonus goals. In each round, each player has a set number of actions they can perform by doing  one of 4 options (Play a Bird, Gather Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards). As you play a bird, you will improve the efficiency or power of another action based on where you place your bird in your habitat. Over the course of your game, your Food/Egg/Card Draw engine will improve, making each action you take more satisfying and powerful. The game ends after all players have used all of their actions in Round 4.  We have only played this game with 2 players so far, and it is very satisfying. With 2 people, it takes about 45 minutes to play the game (will take longer with more players). I highly recommend this game! Please mark if you find my review helpful. Thank you so much!",5.0
4644,B07MC9JN56,R30UQFUMC3J373,Two or three games and this one takes flight,"  The first time I played Wingspan, with a group of serious gamers, I wasn't sure I liked the game as much as the critical reviews told me I should. Every bird collected into your ""aviary"" comes with a power that changes the dynamic of your strategy; and, I felt that a lucky player could tilt the game early on by collecting a few particular birds.  It comes down, sometime, to the luck of the food dice available to you and, subsequently, that luck follows over into determining what birds you can play based on the food you have on hand.  But, the game is beautiful to look at and looks great on the table; so, I bought my own copy despite my initial reservations.  When I got my copy, I played its solitaire version a dozen or so times.  That's when the game won me over.  No pun intended, but the game did win more often than not.  But, the point is, as I played over and over and came to know the 170 unique bird cards, I began to appreciate how balanced the game is.  I just hadn't appreciated my strategic possibilities in that first play.  I do now.  I have since introduced the game to a group of more casual gamers; and, in a very tight game, a first-timer took a well-earned victory.  On first play, these gamers (a family of friends) found the game so enjoyable, they are now seeking a copy of their own . . . . not an easy thing to find.  My advice:  if you see this game in stock anywhere (Amazon, CoolStuffInc.com, Miniature Market), grab it.  The first play or two might have you scratching your head; but, it will take flight.",4.0

There's loads of reviews that can go into the details, also, the bird facts are great and they're very cute.I'm mostly writing this review because I see ""offers"" to charge $135 for this print run on Amazon, and the worst part is it appears to be dropshippers as they're only providing the game once June comes around. This is just the date for the next print run, the publisher will sell you the same game at the same time for a much lower price - this game just gets scalped sometimes because it won a bunch of awards.I bought this game months ago for $50 on Amazon, as good as it is, it is *not* worth $135.

4649,B07MC9JN56,R455IBJT8NLBR,A bit Confusing & Overwhelming at first-- Then it all clicked and became a lot of fun!,"  (tl;dr  5 Stars for gorgeous layout and intriguing gameplay. A lot of fun once you figure it out!  But, confusing at first.)I will admit that I was really overwhelmed and frustrated the first time I played this game. I *wanted* to like it-- it is gorgeous and expensive and was highly rated on board game websites! But, the instructions were really confusing, and there are so many pieces and components.The game is played in 4 rounds (a round consists of each player taking 5-8 turns). At the end of Round 1, my husband and I were totally lost and confused. By the end of Round 2, I was frustrated and embarrassed that I had wasted so much money on a game. But, by the end of Round 3, we began to be intrigued-- as you ""activate"" the bird cards, the game starts to take on a life of its own. As we began Round 4, it all suddenly ""clicked"" in our brains, and the gameplay finally made sense.  As soon as that first game ended, we enthusiastically played a 2nd game, excited to play it now that we actually understood what we were doing.We've played the game about 10 times now, and it keeps getting better and better.  As we get to know the game better, it's like peeling away the layers of an onion. There's a lot to consider when formulating a strategy, but there's a lot of luck involved too. We knew it was a great game when we found ourselves talking about it for days after playing a game, discussing what went right or wrong or what we're going to do differently next time.In summary, the game is really entertaining and has a lot of depth to it. But, I only recommend it if you're willing to slog through confusing instructions and devote the time necessary to learn how to play.",5.0
4650,B07MC9JN56,RHWIKYFIUF2NK,A new family favorite,"  I'm not big into board games but this game was recommended to me because of my interest in birds. I purchased it based on the stellar reviews. The rest of my family tends to enjoy board games more than I do, but we have all enjoyed this one. The materials are high quality, and the game itself is easy enough to learn. It takes a bit of time to set it up (especially for the first time) and get everyone acquainted with the rules. It took the five of us two hours to play our first game. But now it takes less than an hour (or less, if the game is still set up from the last time).There is a bit of luck involved with the game, as the bird cards that you draw at the very beginning can be a make-or-break moment depending on what you get. But the birds have such a diversity of point values and abilities that they create a game where it's difficult to settle into a routine strategy from game to game.The one puzzling thing we ran across was the four clear plastic trays (and lids) provided with the game. It was unclear what we were supposed to do with them. From the Stonemaier website, we learned that two of these are supposed to be used to hold the eggs and the other two hold the food tokens. I'm not sure if these containers are intended just for storage purposes or if they're meant for use in-game also, but we've found it's much easier to keep the different types of food tokens separated. Thus it's easier to find the specific food you're looking for on your turn. So while we're playing, we use the four trays and a lid to hold the five types of food in the center of the table, and use the three leftover lids to hold the eggs and spread them around the table a bit.We have the third printing and I still see a few typos in the rulebooks. It's a bit puzzling to me how all of these haven't been fixed yet with so many people pointing them out (not to mention the game's hired proofreaders). But they don't affect gameplay or my enjoyment of the game so it doesn't affect my rating. Just thought I'd mention it.EDIT: We've owned the game for two months now and I'm not exaggerating when I say we've played it at least three dozen times. My wife can't get enough of this game. However, we have made some modifications to the gameplay to suit our tastes, and I thought I'd edit my review to share them in case anyone else wants to try.1. We don't usually play with the end-of-round goals. They add a layer of complexity, but we think the game is complex enough with the different habitats and bonus cards you're already working with. One of our kids prefers playing with the goals, because he likes focusing on them. But if he's not playing, we usually go without.2. We play eight turns per round. Since we're not using our wooden blocks to track goal points, we can use all eight for each round. This lengthens the game by six turns, so not a huge deal, but it makes a big difference in feeling like you get to use the engine you've spent all game building. In the shorter game, it feels like the game ends just as you've finally got things going.3. We start with 5 bird cards, 1 of each food, and 2 bonus cards, and only discard one bonus card. We felt like the beginning of the game is a bit of a struggle when you play by the rulebook and discard a number of cards or food before you start. You end up spending most of the first round scrounging up cards or food with little to show for it. We like to get going with a little more momentum. One problem we ran into with this at first was that someone could get really lucky with the five birds and bonus cards they drew, and the game would be essentially over from the get-go. So we began a draft where you would select one card from the five you were dealt, then pass the rest to your neighbor. Select one more from that pile, then pass. Continue until you have five cards again. Then discard one of your bonus cards. That evens the playing field for everyone.4. Sometimes we play with another variant that we call ""Blackout,"" where you play the game until someone has filled up their entire board with bird cards. Once that last bird card is played, everyone (including the person that played the bird card) gets one more turn and then the game is over. We still play this variant with rounds of eight turns, clearing the bird tray after every round, and rotating who goes first like normal. We're just not limited to four rounds. Usually it lasts around five.Obviously these aren't going to be everyone's cup of tea, but they make an already enjoyable game even more of a favorite for us.",5.0
4651,B07MC9JN56,R1LLUUZOPQCTA9,Great game!,"  I don't think I can praise this game enough.  We have about 60 games in our collection now, and this one is currently our favorite.  Everything from the components to the table presence to the game play are so good.It is a ""eurogame"", which means that you are mostly focused on your own board and collecting points.  There isn't really any ""take that"" in this game.  My family really enjoys this style of gameplay.There are a lot of cool decisions to work through as the game progresses.  I'd consider it a medium weight game because there are quite a few rules to learn. But watch a few how-to-play videos or find someone who already knows how to play and you'll be up to speed on it quickly.  We've shown it to friends and family who are not necessarily into heavier games, and they have really enjoyed it.It can go on for a while at higher player counts.  I think we played for almost 2 hours at 5 players, with some teaching needed for a new player.  But it didn't feel like it was near that long. It's a very smooth and overall quick moving game.I know it's a bit hard to find right now (summer 2019).  But when the price is down to around MSRP, this is an easy decision.  If you enjoy board games and want something more than what you typically find in the big box store, buy this.  You'll be glad you did.",5.0
4652,B07MC9JN56,R1YZBYXTTUDYYB,Worth the MSRP,"  It‚Äôs frequently sold out so there is quite a premium being added to it‚Äôs already high price.  I kept an eye on Stonemeier‚Äôs website to know when another printing was occuring.I am not going to review the gameplay.  There are tons of videos on YouTube and reviews on board game geek so you can see if you would like it.  I will say, the concept is very different and many people have an immediate WTF reaction to the description on the box.  Personally, I am hoping my whole family will play it togetherRather, I want to review the value.  Right off, opening the box revealed a wonderful set of manuals.  They are printed on high quality paper and feel great to the touch.  The rulebooks are not too dense and filled with artwork.Next, there is a plastic card tray for when you play and also to hold the cards when you put it away.There is a cardboard tower to put together, the instructions are easy to follow.  Little wooden eggs and wooden dice are included, and a limited amount of time is needed to punch out the cardboard food tokens.  Plastic trays are included to hold the eggs and tokens.  A couple of extra plastic bags are included to hold any loose items.On the side of the inside box is a handy diagram that explains how to put the game away.The only negative is a crappy paper scoring pad.  Otherwise the theme, artwork, and quality of the game reflect the price.",5.0
4653,B07MC9JN56,R105WUH001D5SH,A great gateway game,"  The 170 bird cards in this game have lovely illustrations.  The miniature eggs are in pretty pastels, the dice are wooden, and a birdfeeder-like cardboard dice tower is included.  Based on the components, I give this game five stars.The game comes with an outstanding solo-mode Automa.  The gameplay works well as a light introductory engine-building gateway game.  The gameplay isn‚Äôt deep but the cards do provide a lot of variety.  An expansion is planned that might present new challenges.  Overall, I like this game and would recommend it especially to those new to the boardgaming hobby.",5.0
4654,B07MC9JN56,RVWY02X7PPE93,Game Came Damaged,"  Love this game and couldn't wait to give it to my friend as a gift. I wrapped the box up and they were happy when they opened it, but there was a cut through the game box!Return deadline passed since it was a gift and the company won't work with me for a new one. Hoping this review may change their mind. Brand new game, in the plastic wrap and everything, and you can see the cut through the wrapping and the box. I'm so sad to have spent so much money on a damaged game.",1.0
4655,B07MC9JN56,R1CQWB5CTTTA39,Beautiful.,"  All the components are extraordinarily beautiful, especially the bird cards.  The game is easy to learn, but it does present some challenges for putting together the optimal sequence of plays.  The theme comes through in the mechanics in subtle but amusing ways.There's limited player interaction, especially if you choose non-competitive public goals.  We find ourselves not keenly interested in our opponents' turns.  This can be fine, according to your tastes, because a lot of people prefer to avoid thwarting the other players.I'm really happy to have this game on my shelf, as it creates an inviting option for casual players or to play in a short time window on a weekday.  It's not my favorite game (even among engine-builders) but I enjoy playing it.  I prefer Gizmos, which is a similar game mechanically but lacks the sophisticated table presence of Wingspan.",5.0
4656,B07MC9JN56,R2ZZAPQXZ073K8,So Pretty and Fun That You Enjoy It Even When You Lose,"  COMPONENTSThis is where this game shines above any other board game.+ The Outer Storage Box is Pretty Solid and Sturdy+ The player mats fold nicely. They're thick and give feel of leather finish.+ The storage tray for cards and smaller storage compartments for food tokens, and eggs is good bonus+ Little eggs are pretty and look like small candies!++ The bird house and wooden dice are awesome! They didn't have to include the card-board dice tower but I'm so glad they did!+ The illustrations on the player mat and all the bird cards is pretty and beautifully done. I do enjoy the little bird trivia for each bird that's included on the bird cards.* The card-board bird tokens are okay.- Now I'm nit-picking but since everything else is so good, if the player cubs could be little birds, that would be amazing!- The play a bird row is pretty narrow. That could have a little width added to it. (but that'd just lead to bigger player mat and then bigger storage box, so may be the reason they didn't do it)GAMEPLAYThis is an engine building game where your actions become stronger as you move to later stages in the game.The game is played over 4 rounds where players take turns placing their tokens on one of the action spaces. These actions are 1) play a bird (in Tree / Grass / Wetland habitat), 2) Gain Food, 3) Lay Egg, 4) Draw Cards. As you take these actions repeatedly the later 3 actions become stronger and stronger as the birds that you play give you special powers which become activated. These powers could be gain additional food, cache food, lay additional eggs, draw additional cards etc.The game also has end of round goals. Which is the only thing to make you pay attention to your opponents as you directly compete for these goals for end of round bonuses. At the end of round you use one of your player cube to mark your position. Thus subsequent rounds give you less turns. In the beginning you have 8 cubes, 2nd round has 7 cubes, then 6 and then 5.The game is equal fun with 2-5 players. Sometimes in worker placement games it happens that player wait for their turn and don't pay attention when other players are playing. But in this game, the turns are fast. You do pay attention to your opponents for end of round goals and also certain bird powers that you have. You may have a bird which gives you extra eggs when the opponent lays eggs. Or opponets themselves could activate some powers where each opponets gains a food token or bird card or an egg. So it's not that you just wait for your turn.GAME DURATIONThe game plays pretty fast. A 2 player game can be completed in 60 mins. And a 4-5 player game can be completed under 2 hours. Both including setup and tear down time.AUTOMA (SINGLE PLAYER)I have tried automa few times. It's pretty good and competitive. You can adjust the automa difficulty level to normal, medium, hard and legendary.CONCLUSION* The game is fairly easy to teach. All the people that I played this game with, loved it and immediately wanted their own copy.* The game is a great gateway to board games, worker placement category, engine building category or Euro games.* The game design is thoroughly play-tested and competitive.* The luck factor is minimal and most of games are very competitive. The first time we played the 2 player game the scores were 70-72. The multiplayer game had scores of 91, 94, 97, and 100.* I highly recommend this game for all levels of experiences, expertise and groups.",5.0
4657,B07MC9JN56,R3QMWC3NAUJLI2,Too complicated.  Design does not allow for fun of competition.,"  I bought this for my wife who was recovering from surgery of a broken arm.

Do you hate a cleverly done board game?Wingspan has proven it's worth on my gaming shelf. I like birds, but this game is like a NatGeo bird marathon in a game. I know im probably not selling this, but the game is about birdwatching. I know, birdwatching?Wingspan allows you to take 1 action per tern which really helps out with teaching others. You will be playing the beautiful bird cards while laying eggs and grabbing some mice, grubs, or fish from the bird feeder. The more bird cards you play the more powerful your actions get. That's pretty much Wingspan in a nut shell.The card abilities can really make or break a game. I couldn't recommend this game enough for board game enthusiasts. It has a very deep strategic approach while also having the ability to get beat by someone who just keeps playing their favorite birds.",5.0

4660,B07MC9JN56,R3S3WH9AJ7IIFD,Wingspan Is Worth It! And So Is an Upgrade!,"  I loved this game way more than I thought I would. I knew I would like it a lot, but so far I have played it maybe 15 times just Solo. I have played it also as 2-player, which is very good. The components are stunning and I loved reading all the info about the birds. The game has a lot of depth as an engine builder and it‚Äôs fun to try different combos of cards. The eggs made me think of the Cadbury candy coated mini eggs (so much that I had to go out immediately to find it‚Äôs Halloween equivalent, which is Harvest Mix). I put 4 for Easy to Learn because the rules are very straight forward and make sense. I didn‚Äôt give that category a 5 because someone who is new to strategy games might need extra time to figure out, but they could pick it up really quickly if someone else were there to show them what to do. Incidentally, there is another version of the game that includes a swift start pack that helps take players through a sample turn. And on the publisher‚Äôs website, they also sell the swift start pack by itself for not a lot of $, but currently they are not in stock as of this review. You can put yourself on the notification list, though. Other things I would recommend pairing with this game are upgraded food tokens (geek bits) through the BGG store ($32, boardgamegeekstore.com) and the upcoming European bird expansion that you can find on Amazon and through the publisher. I am excited for the expansion to come out because it comes with more bird cards, more eggs, more tokens, another card tray, and more goals, as well as different kinds of card mechanisms and abilities.",5.0

(We have a bird feeder in our front yard, so obviously we love birds.) This game is perfect for bird lovers of all ages; it‚Äôs easy enough to learn, but it‚Äôs ever changing based on the birds you draw, so it never gets boring! My only complaint is how expensive it is. Even buying it on sale it was just over $100. Normally, I would never pay that much for a game and I probably never will again, but this game is definitely made with top notch quality and we play it all the time, so honestly, while the cost made me cry, metaphorically speaking, it was well worth the money spent!",5.0

Attempted a training round, read outloud so we all could hear the directions, and had a very difficult time. We gave up after an hour. After we parted for the holiday visit, my daughter in law watched the YouTube video on how to play and said it is easier than we thought, so in the next few months we'll be together again to try it again.

It is a wonderful sensory experience - the artwork is beautiful, and the components are well-constructed. Everything feels nice and solid, from the textured cards to the smooth wooden dice. The gameplay works quite well. The game is definitely not cooperative, but neither is it cut-throat. In general, each player just tries to improve his or her board and does not do harm to other players.The only downside of this game is that it is possible for a player to get behind early in the game, and there are not really any mechanics that help a player who is trailing get caught back up to the others. This makes that player's experience a bit less enjoyable.",5.0

The components are of such a high quality and the RULE BOOK! Just wait until you see it. I've played with four and I've played several solo games. I love playing both ways. It was easy to expkain to the new people to the game, so if you are playing with people who have played other modern board games, they will catch on quickly!It's my new favorite game!",5.0
4665,B07MC9JN56,R2TDNGZ5NP0ZM6,My favorite board game,"  Although I do enjoy other games (Terraforming Mars among them), I have to say that Wingspan has quickly become my favorite. It is an engine building game with an innovative theme and extraordinary artwork. It takes a few times through to start seeing how the game works and to plan decent strategies, but most folks seem to pick it up fairly quickly. I like that it is not extraordinarily long (some TMars games last over 3 hours!) and that, while a competitive game, you are not actively hindering other players.

You need all of them to have a good game...but at the same time, if the cards aren‚Äôt there the game really falls flat and the start is very slow.Great presentation, hopefully some future upgrades will add variety in game play and not just more bird variety.The game is very easy to teach however.

The game was definitely fun (the first time around). We were all laughing pretty hard.  But the fun came to a halt when we ran out of cards. You do not get that many cards in this game.  And the minute you restart, it's not as fun anymore. You are now repeating images from an hour ago.  I will resort back to my ""Cards Against Humanity"" game because of the large amount of cards to play, as well as having expansion packs available.

I didn't want to spoil the fun, so I stopped reading and put the cards away until I could get a chance to play with some friends.This is the time to add that I should have continued reading the cards before I decided to play with my sister in law and 10 year old son. A few cards in and I realized that yes, this is definitely an ADULT game! The mixture of funny, yet innocent, cards definitely deceived me at first.  Whoops! Lesson learned!I finally had a chance to play a full game with some friends last night and it was hysterical!When I purchased this game initially, I also ordered the pink expansion pack. I'm very glad I did as having more cards definitely added to the game and made it so we could play longer. I really hope they continue to make expansion packs, but I'd like to see some extra picture cards either added to those packs or sold as a separate expansion pack. If you plan to play this often, more cards are definitely needed.If CAH is your style, I think you'll really enjoy this game. It offers a little change of pace while still offering some of the same humor to those of us who don't take things too seriously.For any parents of teens/preteens whose kids are ""too cool"" for board games now, this honestly would be a good choice as well IF you go through the cards before giving it to them and remove the ones that you deem inappropriate. The picture cards are all innocent and they could definitely have a great time playing.I hope the makers of this game see the market out there for a teen/kids version of this!

From the minute it was unboxed everyone was really interested in the game. We played with 3 couples and had a blast! The game is simple and very entertaining. We did pass on using the red cards, which would have probably made the game even better had we played it right. The ONLY negative feedback I have to give is we found a grammar error on one card... which was surprising! No worries though. 10/10.",5.0

I would beware before playing with your family (made that mistake) as their are MANY inappropriate/uncomfortable cards in there (that would be funny if you were just with friends). There are a few rape jokes and a few about Christianity, which I wish was not included, as I don't find joking about either of those matters to be funny. However, we just discarded those right away and didn't let it get us down. We still had a lot of fun with this. Would recommend for any meme-lover :)",4.0

We played this at a girls night birthday party and everyone was laughing and loved the game. It comes with a separate set of cards that are adult content, the only thing I don't like is they look the same as all the regular cards, so if you mix them into the regular cards you likely will never find them all! So now our cards will always be adult content only. Great with a group, but we had 15 people so it did take a long time to get thru the cards. You can split up the game and have two games going at the same time, or just play together. Lots of fun!",5.0

My recommendation would include some better meme cards and perhaps fewer reading cards about dicks. At the very least, I recommend making the reading cards more relatable to the meme or make the memes more relatable to the reading cards. While we definitely got several good laughs out of the game, it began to feel like the it was created by a couple of 16yo boys or the creators lacked originality. Trust me, this complaint is not coming from some prude without a sense of humor, remember I prefer CAH which is probably the most politically incorrect game one can play.

I could tell they thought it would be cheesy, but everyone in our group, from ages 18-65, from meme experts to meme noobs, was laughing and having a great time. What Do You Meme may seem like a corporate gimmick that's headed into ""fellow kids"" territory just to make money, but as a millennial, you can take my word that the memes you make while playing are actually hilarious. It's almost the same as Cards Against Humanity, but instead of matching questions with funny answers, you match images with funny captions. Some of the images are recognizable, like Harold, and some are more obscure, like a crying Pepe sticking a fork into a light socket. The ""mature"" (aka explicit) caption cards come wrapped separately so you can decide whether or not to use them, but I highly recommend including them. Those were the ones that had us rolling in our chairs the most. Highly recommended for everyone, this is my new go-to party game!",5.0

The potential for hilarious and uncomfortable results is high.  I'm planning on buying some expansion packs.  Cards are decent size for intimate around the table play but wouldn't be ideal for a big crowd. There's a lot of caption cards and an ok amount of picture cards but not nearly enough. I was surprised that there weren't more of the ""viral"" memes. I suppose you could find more memes online and continue playing with the caption cards.  Hubs and I went through all the pic cards pretty quickly. Of course with different caption cards the same pictures could be used over and over with hilariously different results.  A couple of the *MA captions would pose uncomfortable results for prudish or immature players but overall the game seems fun.  Well packaged. The ""easel"" reminds me of something my kids made in preschool with a couple popsicle sticks and glue, but it's not really necessary anyway.  I went back and forth on good games to buy for a fairly raucous group. After seeing a couple of the games I was glad I purchased this one.",5.0

Very enjoyable.2nd time playing it at another Thanksgiving gathering this time with Hispanic liberals. Two rounds in and they decided to have one person pick the picture to meme, one person (with the least accent ü§£ to read - that was me) and we all voted on the funniest meme.

4758,B00C3SFFEI,R2J9ZZXZJTNEJT,Having loved this game as a child,"  Having loved this game as a child, and not having played for the 2 decades since, I was quite anxious for my 6 year old son to open this on Christmas morning.  To my despair, it was 3 more days of him playing with all of his other toys before I could get him to play it with my wife and I, but now, its the only game he wants to play.If you played the original, the game holds pretty true to what you played back in the 80's, the board is sold and sturdy, the tickets are made of thick cardboard and will hold up.  The playing pieces are a little different, but the game play holds true with one notable difference, in the original version you always played all 5 detectives against Mr X, regardless of how many players there were.  In this version of the rules, there are always 4 detectives (unless 6 are playing the game, the all 5 detectives are used).  With less than 4 detectives, the difference is made up with ""bobbies"" I call them ""helpers"" for my son.  The bobbies are free to move at will, w/o the need to use tickets.  If its just a two player game, the one detective plays two pawns that can share tickets, and two bobbies that don't need tickets.  On the surface this seems insignificant, but once you start playing you'll notice that it simplifies game play for the detectives not having to micro-manage each game piece to ensure you don't run out of tickets.  You do play with 4, instead of 5, detectives, but that disadvantage is made up for the fact that the extra detectives can move freely w/o needing tickets.If you haven't played the original, and that previous pargraph means nothing to you, then this is a really fun game.  My wife, not being much of a strategy boardgame fan, initially commented, ""this game is pointless, you like literally have no idea what you are doing, its just random guessing"".  That attitude was over about half way through as she got into it and became quite interested.  You really do get a little bit of a rush of adrenelne playing as Mr X when you know you are about to get caught, but see an escape route, and a huge sense of relief if you can get to it.  Likewise, there is equally as much enjoyment playing detective and knowing you've got Mr X trapped that is equally disappointing to you learn a few moves later he has escaped and made it far out of your reach.The game is rated for ages 8 and up.  My six year old does okay with it.  Its pretty easy for him when he plays detective and you can help him along, but he does on occasion mess things up when he plays as Mr. X.  Its been found on more than one occasion that he made an illegal move, usually by taking a taxi to a station that didn't have a taxi route, or taking a bus or or two stations too far.  This is just a learning curve however, and I doubt he will have trouble much longer.I've seen some comments mentioning the game wasn't in English.  This version, that I'm reviewing, the board was printed entirely in English.  The instruction manuals are printed in multi language with English being in the very back.  There was one part of the English instructions that got cut off, it mentioned something along the lines of ""At no time can"" and then the next paragraph started.  I was able to switch to the French instructions, find the part that was missing, and put it into Google translate, it just said that at no time no two detectives could occupy the same space on the same turn.",5.0
4759,B00C3SFFEI,R3I6XAGR1U2QU0,Great cooperative strategy game!,"  A fun game that we feel best to play with several adults. It might be too frustrating and stressful for kids unless they are shepherded along by the entire group and being supported for their moves. As agents, we cooperate with one another on moves to try to trap the bad guy, Mr. X. The person who plays Mr. X actually has the tougher role, despite his advantage of being invisible most of the time. There's no doubt that it's a bit nerve-racking to have several people chasing you. Winning the game boils down to a combination of strategy, psychology and sometimes just pure luck. Regardless, we have a lot of fun playing Scotland Yard. And Ravensburger has, once again, made a very sturdy and easy to navigate game. The visor for Mr. X is also a nice touch, shielding Mr. X's eye movements from the agents so he can focus more stealthily on his actual location and future moves. We've played an older version of Scotland Yard that didn't have a visor and it was a distinct disadvantage for Mr. X, who is having a stressful enough time as it is. That said, the visor that is included in this version is made of thin cardboard that uncomfortably cuts into the forehead. So we would recommend that a regular visor and/or a pair of cheap dollar store mirrored sunglasses be used instead.",5.0
4760,B00C3SFFEI,R3S9AHSHBUMZY2,"DEDUCTION - ""It's elementary, my dear Watson""","  This is a game full of deduction, that Sherlock Holmes would have LOVED.  This is the third one of these board games that I have purchased - one for myself and two for gifts.  It is a very challenging, and extremely fun game.  The object of the game is to capture the ""Mister X"" (who is one of the players).  It is a all-vs-one kind of game.  There is a network of detectives that are strung out throughout London, using deduction and clues that Mister X reveals, to determine the location of the scoundrel.  It sounds east, but trust me, it is not.  3/4 of the games end early with Mister X captured, and it takes a lot of skill and solid thinking skills to be able to get away.  It is a great family game that I would recommend 100% to those that are shopping for a gift for someone else.  Younger kids also can play as detectives, as they are working with a team, and you can have lots of family bonding time with this game.  I think that the only bad thing, is that there is only one Mister X and that everyone always wants to be him, but in all, this is a great game that I would 100% recommend to families.

4761,B00C3SFFEI,R39Y6GI25AEW3X,Instruction Guide Poor; Many Questions Remain....,"  Bought this game as a family Christmas present. Pros and Cons below -Pros:Game and materials are sturdy and well-made. The concept and ""plot"", while simple, seem to be thought out and organized out well. Games are relatively short (in comparison to say, Settlers of Catan, Ticket to Ride, etc) at maybe 30-45 minutes with 4 people.Cons:After the first couple of games, it was clear to us that the instruction guide, while accommodating 6 languages, was very poorly executed. Being in the US, we read the US instructions. At the outset, they mentioned that for the ""beginner version"" of the game, the metro/tube is not used as a mode of transportation. Okay fine, fair enough. However, one would think that at a later point in the user guide there would be alternate instructions explaining an advanced(?) version, right? But the very brief US instructions explain ONLY the beginner version of the game. ZERO instruction on how to play a ""non-beginner"" version of the game, despite including several other game pieces that were clearly included for that version, but sat in the box unused. Later on as I perused the other languages in the instruction guide, I looked through the UK/English instructions, which were significantly different  from the US/English ones. Was this the ""advanced"" version of the game the game implies exists, but does not bother to explain? I think so, but cannot be 100% sure because the instructions offer no explanation or guidance to this end in English.Secondly, are there 3 water taxi routes at players' disposal? On the board, it is pretty clear that the intent is to show 3 yellow-to-yellow (taxi) type routes that span great distances up and down the river, which could be very convenient in a pinch, but again, the instructions do not say a peep about these, so we did not use them since there is no mention of water taxis.These are the 2 glaring short-comings of this game in our experience. Is there somewhere online that has a more complete version of the game rules?",3.0

He loves board games and I needed one that was fun, but also one that a family-sized group could play.  The verdict is that he loves it.  It was a lot of fun to play in a group with everyone taking a turn being the bad guy.  It was especially interesting to watch the adults over-think and over-plan just to get caught fairly quickly. On the flip side, it was also interesting learning how to work together to trap the bad guy. Overall, it took a little time to go over the rules the first time, but after that it's fairly straight forward and easy to remember.",5.0
4764,B00C3SFFEI,R26UJ3CWMI7P7J,Fun game for the whole family,"  Scotland Yard is my family's favorite board game.  The kids will even get off computers and Kindles to come play.  Everybody wants to be Mr X, the bad guy who has to try evade the detectives of Scotland Yard who are helped by up to 2 Bobbies.  The Bobbies can travel almost anywhere using tubes, busses and taxies, while the detectives have to use their tickets that they are allocated at the beginning of the game to move.  Mr X keeps a record of where he is and has to tell the other players what mode of transport he used but not where he actually is, unless he is on one of the ""show yourself"" rounds.  He then has to put his board piece on the board and then everybody else has to try see if they can catch him before the end of the game.  Mr X does have a few extra cards to make it even more difficult for the detectives.  He can do 2 moves in a row and he can also travel secretly, so nobody knows what he used.  He is also able to travel on the Thames, while the detectives and Bobbies can't.  This game can be played by 2 to 6 people.  If you have more people you don't play with Bobbies, only detectives.  My kids are 8 and 11 and really get into trying to work out where Mr X is so that they can catch him (or her).  We like the game so much , we even took it in hand luggage when we went on a long trip and had a long stopover so that we could play it in the airport.",5.0

I got the version that has pictures of each type of transport, not the words.  I like the pictures, so I am very pleased with that.  My youngest son got very frustrated with not knowing where Mr. X was on his hidden movements.  So maybe depending on the audience it might be difficult for some to grasp.

This is still a great ""starter"" hidden movement games for a family or friends...but, there are much better out there. Letters from whitechapel, fury of dracula, and the last friday are all examples. I don't think it plays all that great with 2 players, compared to some of the others, and the gane is heavily stacked in favor of Mr X.

4788,B07L1CPM28,R1YKRGFV5NNR3H,"Enjoyable Game, Looking Forward to Expansions!","  I just received this game, reorganized it with some inserts, and commenced a few solo games, followed by a 2-person game. Overall, it was a fun game.  It's light, casual, and easy to teach.  I was able to show my husband how to play in a matter of minutes and he is looking forward to playing again.  Don't let this game fool you though.  There is a lot of strategy involved, and both my husband and I kept overthinking our turns (we might benefit from a timer to reduce our analysis paralysis).I even liked the solo mode.  The difference between the multi-player mode and the solo mode is use of a 15 card deck.  While in the multiplayer mode the players take turns verbally selecting the building material (brick, glass, wheat, wood, or stone) with no restrictions, the solo game limits your options to 3 flipped over cards from the 15-card deck (3 cards each of brick, glass, wheat, wood, and stone = 15).  Once you pick 1 of the 3 cards, you place that resource cube on the board, then draw a replacement card, to bring you back up to 3 face-up cards; rinse and repeat.  The scoring for solo play is in the instruction booklet, where there are score ranges to indicate your skill level (eg:  10-17 points for Builder‚Äôs Apprentice, 32-37 for Town Planner, to name a few).The components are well-made.  I did notice a smoky (camp fire) aroma from the wood building pieces, but after I aired them out, it went away. There seems to be more space than you need for the cards, which I hope is an indicator of upcoming expansions.  I will definitely buy any expansion for this game; sign me up!",5.0
4789,B07L1CPM28,RJE3LA910L6EY,A simple game with plenty of decisions and oodles of fun!,"  We really enjoyed this game! It is a little spacial puzzle that you immediately want to try again and again. We play a lot of heavier board games, but we still enjoy a lighter game if it is this fun. It is simple enough for casual gamers to enjoy while still offering plenty of logical, puzzley, decision-making goodness. Because of the different building types available each game, the strategy will change each game as well.The rules are very simple and easy to learn. The game even includes a few variants for different player counts. The components are made of wood and of very good quality. They feel great to pickup and place on your board. It comes with a plastic insert that stores all the pieces safely and easily. This a a great quality game!Things to like:- Good for variety of ages and skill levels- Good quality components and insert- Good replay value and variations- Quick to set up and play- Very fun for how simple it seemsThings you may not like (or maybe you will?):- Very abstract game (you are just placing blocks and buildings)- May be a bit slow when playing at maximum player counts (the variant rules included do help with this)We would totally recommend this game!",5.0
4790,B07L1CPM28,R1FDMLE5T5HFKA,Easy to learn game with tons of strategy,"  We have only had this one a couple of days and I can already tell that it's going to hit our table pretty often.  We typically enjoy the more ""euro"" style games where each player is focused on their own board, so this one fits that bill.  We also enjoy puzzles, and this one is definitely a good puzzle.The box says it is intended for age 14+.  However, my 7 and 8 year olds were watching my wife and I play last night and asked if they could play too.  We said yes and they kept up pretty well!  So I think that shows how easy to teach the game is.  We did take out the monument aspect of the game when we played with them and they didn't really care about points.  But in the end, they had pretty nice looking final boards and had a good time.It seems this one will have a lot of replay value.  There are a lot of options for each building type, the monuments add more flavor, and even the different options on how to choose resources (players calling out vs using cards) can change the feel of the game.  The solo variant is a very nice addition as well.I think this is good to show someone who likes board games but doesn't really know much about modern/designer games.  It's a step above most big-box games.I do ding it one star because I do feel like the cost is a little high for what is in the box.  I know there are a lot of wooden components, but still it seems it's priced about $10 too high at $40 MSRP.  If you can get it for $30 or less, I think that's a better value.  But don't let that dissuade you too much.  It's a great game and very justifiable at $40.",4.0
4791,B07L1CPM28,RLCXNC7BLAH4B,"4.5 Stars Here, Very Happy with This Purchase","  I'm not much into family games but like to have a few. I often find them too simple, too lucky or too long. Tiny Towns not only stays within these limits but manages to captivate with fun timely game play.  I find it scales well with the Town Hall variant but there are a couple imperfections which keep it just shy of a true 5 star rating. 1. it's slightly awkward to keep track of who is doing what and what has been done. Is it time to flip the next card or move the turn along? I read players are supposed to keep their hands up but it was a minor bump in the flow. 2. The scoring can be somewhat complex and there are no reference cards. To make matters worse, the large building cards in the center of the table have extremely small text. It will take some familiarizing or you might want to type some cheat sheets up. For me the scoring isn't really a hit on the game because that's what adds to the strategy but it might be a little overwhelming for more casual players and without references it's even worse during the first game. Other than that a very fun accessible game that will see a lot of play. The components are large and high quality and I didn't find the abstract design and concepts to be a buzzkill. I think function is more important than extra eye candy and we didn't find it boring at all.",5.0
4792,B07L1CPM28,R1TUBQTWPK7SLN,A perfect game for game night,"  We love this game! It‚Äôs a in depth game without being too long or confusing. It‚Äôs my new favorite. It has a few different ways to play to keep things fresh. I‚Äôve always wanted to try games like catan but don‚Äôt have the time or the patience to learn or invest in it. We‚Äôve played it with friend that like the longer games and they didn‚Äôt like it as much as we did.

4793,B07L1CPM28,R3XC0YJC2OYRY,Tiny Town. Big Box. Enormous fun.,"  If you like puzzle-esque games, but still enjoy getting a group together at the table, then this is what you want. Where puzzle meets party game. Don't misread that, this isn't a party game, but it goes beyond your typical puzzle games where it's 2 people at the table quietly trying to contemplate their move. Your goal is to construct your town based on the 7 buildings available to everyone at the center of the table. To construct one of the buildings, you use cubes to create the tetris-like shape on the building card. Going clockwise around the table, each player will call out a color cube, and everyone has to take that color on that turn. Your plans will be thwarted, trust me. Especially if you play with the 6 player maximum. I recommend 2-4 players for that sweet spot, but you can absolutely play up to 6. Just be prepared to curse your neighbors! The other aspect is that everyone gets their own monument building that they can choose to construct. Because it's specific to them, it removes the problem mechanism of everyone just building the exact same as everyone else. A terrific game. Super easy to learn. With several options for buildings, the replay value is perfect. An expansion for Tiny Towns is launching Feb. 2020 and I can't wait!",5.0
4794,B07L1CPM28,R36ZTUO97AT4VD,Can we play it again?!,"  The first time I played this with my wife she immediately said ""Can we play it again?!"" This is quite a rare occurance, so that says something. It is very easy to learn, and quick to play. (About 15 minutes per player)I love the mechanic of using the resources in certain shapes to create the buildings for your town. The limits of the board help to make it a fun game as you try to build the best town with the resources that are given to you without painting yourself into a corner. The multiple types of each building, besides the cottage, help with replayability and keep the game interesting without making it overly complicated. The cards for each building make it easy to understand what they do, and what resources in what configuration are needed to build it.The wooden building meeples (Beeples? Muildings?) are very nice, and their colored silhouettes on each building card make it unmistakable what each is every time you play.I have played both the solo game, and the game with 2 and 3 players. I have found it to be a good game at all of these player counts.The wooden master builder hammer makes it easy to see whose turn it is to call resources, and keeps the game moving quickly. There is good natured interaction between players, and even when resources that you don't want are called, it doesn't feel like an attack, but part of the fun in figuring out the puzzle that is Tiny Towns.The solo version works well by using cards with the resources on them; first 3 are drawn, one is chosen and returned to the bottom of the draw pile, the ones you don't use are left behind for subsequent turns. This works well at imitating other players calling resources that you don't want or need.It's a good game with high quality components and interesting mechanisms, with enough player interaction to make it fun, and enough variability to keep it fun.",5.0
4795,B07L1CPM28,R1WK3WIBKA6A05,Confused about positive reviews,"  I'm not sure why this game has so many stars. I buy 2-player games so that my wife and I can play together. With this game and it's unnecessarily overly complicated rules, we each have our own towns, and, besides taking turns calling out resources to build with, we don't interact. We both take resources each turn, and both build, and carry on. It's so independent that when one of us completes our personal board, the other person continues playing until they fill their board, as designed. Then we score up and see who won. The scoring (enough math that requires a scoring chart and pen/pencil) is an underwhelming victory/loss. Ultimately, this ""game"" just felt like work. My wife won our first game. She didn't care. I lost. I didn't care. We were just glad it was over and didn't take too long.2-stars because I've played worse games, but we may never play this one again.",2.0

Of course, the first playthrough is always a wash in order to learn how the game works, but the first playthrough is still fun.While it's easy to learn, there is a lot of strategy involved in placing your building and gathering resources in order to buid--and that's what I like about this game. Easy to learn, but takes skill to master. It's got a bit of Tetris involved because of the way resources and buildings are placed, so that's where a lot of the thinking comes into play.This game has a lot of potential to have expansions and apparently one expansion is in the works.",5.0
4798,B07L1CPM28,RM6S1GIIREH5N,Awesome game,"  So far the game brings good variation of game plays. The strategy is affected by many aspects - available buildings and their combinations, your secret building, the building others decided to build. There is an interesting interaction between players - you can either assist each other or play against. It's very strategic and fun.My family enjoys playing the game. We adjusted the rules to allow my 8 yo daughter to play with us. She can store some amount of cubes aside, so it is less destructive for her to build a city.I wish there are more buildings available. I assume they will be available in the future expansions.Highly recommend if you like this type of games!",5.0

Took a little getting used to learning to deal with placement of resources I wasn't planning for, but it forces you to think on your feet and revise your strategy when needed. Had a lot of fun with this with a few different groups of friends, and I'm interested to see what expansions may come down later down the line!Another note, my box accidentally was missing a set of red buildings and had 2 yellows instead.

4837,B00S732WJE,REJN3VSBZ0XIM,The game is fun but the product / manufacturing is terrible.,"  Very rarely do I give bad reviews, but this product really deserves it. I remember this Guess Who from my childhood and had lots of fun playing this with friends and family. But this version of the game is absolutely terrible.#1. When we received the product, one of the card holders was broken. I tried to fix it with some glue so i did not have to return it, but it still would not work.#2 None of the pieces in the row actually line up with each other (See picture).#3 the cardboard that the faces come on seems more like paper than actual cardboard (See Picture).  Two pieces had scratches on them already. You can tell that only the cheapest plastic possible was used to created this game. For the $25 price being charged on Amazon, you'd imagine it being a bit sturdier, but no, this is the type of plastic you can find in toys at the dollar store or Poundland.Also I thought that this game was made by Hasbro, but it is only licensed out by them to some company called Winning Moves Games.Please for the love of all that is good DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE to support a bad quality product for a formerly great game.",1.0

I was really disappointed to find that some of the colors on the cards that are drawn don't match the colors on the board images. For example, black appears as black on the board images and as brown on the cards.  As a result, my children unintentionally give incorrect answers leading to frustrating results. For example - one child asks ""Does your person have black hair?"" to which the other responds ""No"".  This inevitably leads to accusations later in the game - ""You said your person didn't have black hair!! You cheated!"".  When. in fact, no one cheated.

The pictures punch out, but for the kids, easy to tear when getting the game set up.  Also, the kids have a hard time determining which hair is orange versus yellow.  There are also only 2 eye colors... Blue and what looks like orange (weird).  Also, the back piece to the '?' to keep track of your wins was missing for one play board so it won't snap in place.Another issue is when you flip down a person, it flips down the person in front 30-50% of the time because they spaced them too close when they made the game.  I mean... Really?  That would have been so easy to avoid.It is fun once you know what colors each other is calling each color.... Before that you can never guess the right person.

In hindsight, I probably should have shelled out $20 for the retro version because of the little changes this one had that I don't like.A few notes:. The rows are very close together.  When my daughter goes to fold down a person/piece, the row in front of it goes down too. They actually hit the row in front of them as you fold them down.  At that point it becomes a domino effect.The hair colors are very difficult for a young person(and old) to differentiate.

Nonetheless, this game is fun and easy for kids. Most kids. My 5-year-old is an unabashed cheater at almost all games, including candy land. Seriously, hates losing a no-stakes game so much that given a few losses will stop playing--even if she won some as well. Sorry, a bit off topic.

4912,B01M1DPWKV,R7C1A04L6YPXV,Purple Phoenix Games Review,"  One of my favorite classic mass-market games is definitely Clue. Murder, mystery, and a bit of deduction make for an engaging and entertaining game! That being said, even classic games can use a little updating from time to time. Allow me to introduce to you a Clue-on-steroids kind of game named Awkward Guests. How does it hold up to the OG staple? Keep reading to find out!Mr. Walton has been murdered! You have been called in to investigate and get to the bottom of this gruesome mystery. By interrogating the suspects and the household staff, searching for clues, and examining the crime scene, you must decide WHO the killer is, WHY did they commit the murder, and HOW it was done. There may or may not even be an accomplice that needs to be caught too. Put your deduction skills to the test as you work to be the first investigator to solve the case!Disclaimer: I do not intend to rehash the entire rulebook in this review, but rather give a general overview of the rules and gameplay. To read the entire rulebook, check out the game at your FLGS or directly from the publisher! -LAwkward Guests is a card game of hand management, trading, and deduction in which the players are trying to be the first player to solve the murder of Mr. Walton. The game is actually pretty simple to play. To start, each player receives a hand of 6 cards and a case tracking sheet. The cards will have one or more references (case information) on them, as well as a value of 1-3 points, depending on the reliability of the information presented on the card. On your turn, you will ask for information about two different references in which you are interested. The other players will then look through their cards, and offer some or all that pertain to the chosen references in trade to the active player. The active player may then choose a player with whom to trade, giving that player any number of cards, as long as their value equals or exceeds the value of the cards received in trade. Look at your new cards, make notes on your case tracking sheet, and play continues to the next player. After all players have inquired and traded cards, players have the opportunity to solve the mystery. You must know WHO, HOW, and WHY, and possibly the identity of the ACCOMPLICE depending on case difficulty, in order to solve the mystery. If nobody is ready to solve, everyone discards their hand down to 3, and draws new cards to a hand size of 6. A new round then begins, and play continues until one player successfully solves the mystery.When you get down to it, Awkward Guests is easy to learn and play. It mostly consists of trading cards to learn information. That‚Äôs it. And that‚Äôs what makes it a great game, in my opinion. Although it feels more involved than regular Clue, the gameplay itself is very similar and that familiarity is reassuring. One thing that elevates Awkward Guests above Clue is the fact that it requires so much more strategy than original Clue. In Clue, when asking for information, you are asking 1 specific opponent for information, and they have to provide it if they have it. In Awkward Guests, you are able to ask all opponents for information, and they can offer as much or as little information as they want. It increases the amount of strategy required to play, and takes it from a simple grid movement memory game, to one that encourages deduction and compromise. Since players are trading cards, you never know who is holding what cards at any given time, and that makes it harder to pinpoint the information you may need. You can‚Äôt just memorize another player‚Äôs hand of cards, because on any given turn that hand has completely changed. Along those lines as well, you have to decide what information you are willing to trade, in hopes of receiving useful information in return. You don‚Äôt want to just trade back the same cards to the same players in an effort to stunt their investigation, because that could deter them from trading with you in the future. You have to decide when is the right time to trade, and what information you are willing to hand to your opponents, because you need to be receiving new information as well.Another brilliant thing about Awkward Guests is the amount of replayability. Each case uses a different combination of cards, and with so many cards, that means that thousands of different game decks could be generated and played as individual cases. The game design and card system boasts a possible total of 3,600 case solutions, each reached through these different card deck combinations. No matter how many times you play, it is almost guaranteed that you will never play the same case twice. That being said, the biggest downside of Awkward Guests for me is the actual game setup and teardown. Each case deck requires certain cards, so that means to set up, you have to search through all 243 cards and pull out only those required for the selected case. And then after the game, you must sort them all back into their correct order. That just takes a bit of time, and makes it a game that can‚Äôt just be played on the fly.One other downside for me when playing Awkward Guests are the player screens. Each player receives a screen to block their case tracking sheet from opponents. As you learn information, you write it on your sheet to help keep track of your notes and accusations throughout the game. The player screens are also reference sheets, providing much gameplay information to alleviate the need to reference the rulebook at every turn. The downside is that there is just SO MUCH information in the player screens. It is quite overwhelming, and honestly, makes the game seem more complicated and confusing than it really is. I appreciate the effort to provide that cheat-sheet, but it needs to be majorly edited and redacted to be truly useful.Let‚Äôs talk components. The game comes with some high quality double-sided case tracking sheets, and nice sturdy cards and cardboard components. It‚Äôs pretty simple, but really gets the job done effectively. The artwork is pretty basic and the color scheme is mostly monochromatic. It may not be the most exciting game to look at, but the lack of colors makes it feel appropriately thematic.Overall, Awkward Guests is a good step-up game from Clue. It requires strategy, deduction, and even though the game is ultimately competitive, selective cooperation is a key to success. As a huge fan of Clue as a child, I can definitely say that I am a fan of Awkward Guests as an adult. Originally printed in a different language, this game was brought to Kickstarter with an English version in 2018, and I am certainly thankful that the decision was made to reprint it in English! If you like deduction games with a twist, I would absolutely recommend giving this one a shot. Purple Phoenix Games gives Awkward Guests a mysterious 17 / 24.",4.0
4913,B01M1DPWKV,RR9NQYUUS5SNV,Clue on Steroids - Board or Bust Review,"  Mr. Walton suspects someone is trying to kill him, and after inviting all his closest ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and family, his suspicions are confirmed when he is murdered! Like his father always warned him, ‚ÄúPeople who wish you dead make for awkward guests.‚Äù As a detective it is your job to crack the case. Who did it? Why did they do it? How did they do manage to kill him in a house full of people? Was there an accomplice? It‚Äôs up to you to interrogate the suspects, question the household staff, search for clues, and read the police report so that this case can finally be closed. Good luck out there and be cautious. Whoever murdered Woodruff Walton is still in the house with you!Designer: Ron Gonzalo Garc√≠aNumber of Players: 1-8Play Time: 45-75 minutes-Setup-To setup the game, you have to first decide on which case you are going to play. The rulebook has 30 cases in the back that you can use or if you download the Awkward Guests app you won‚Äôt ever run out of cases to solve. Each case has a difficulty level ranging from  Beginner to The Perfect Crime. After choosing the case you will get a list  70 numbers (1-243). The numbers correspond to a specific card in the game and will make up the deck you will use to solve this case. Once the cards are all shuffled, deal ever player a hand of 6 cards and get to solving the murder!-Gameplay-Awkward Guests is played over several rounds. In each round, every player will record new information from the cards they have in their hands, then they will ask for new information. After everyone has had a chance to request new information, each player takes their player token and secretly decides to play it face up or down. Face up means you are ready to try to solve the case, down means you aren‚Äôt sure of the solution and want to keep questioning. After checking the solution, if no one succeeds all players then discard cards and play continues to the next round.Each card has a reference in the top right (specific suspects or rooms of the house) and a value in the top left. On your turn you have to ask for information on 2 pieces of information, for example: 2 suspects, a suspects and a room, or 2 rooms. Then in counter-clockwise order from you each other player sees what cards they have that references what you asked for. If they have any, they can offer you some, none, or all in the form of point values. So if another player has cards with values 2, 3, 3 in regards to what you are asking for they have to decide how much to give away. The more given away is more information gained though because the player requesting information has to reciprocate the same value or more worth of information back. To continue the example above, Sally is willing to give 5 points of information away, if Joe accepts he would have to give at least 5 points back, if he gave two 3 point cards for a value of 6, no change is given. Also once an offer is made it is in stone, so if Sally offered all 8 points worth and Joe didn‚Äôt have/want to give 8 points back he just has to decline the offer. It‚Äôs a very tricky push and pull situation because you want more info but don‚Äôt want to give all your good clues away.After all players have had a chance to request info, the solution phase begins. Each player decided simultaneously if they want to guess the solution or not. If you use a case from the rulebook and are wrong, the game ends for you. If you use the app instead of seeing what the solution is, it just gives you a passed or failed state and you can continue playing. To prevent players from spamming guesses, if you fail your guess you have to skip guessing for one round.With all the suspects, motives, and locations combined there are over 3,600 solutions to each case. The publishing company (Megacorpin Games) uses their ‚ÄúBrilliant Deck System‚Äù to create infinite replayability. Even though there are finite solutions, which cards you use in each game will affect how you reach that conclusion.-Components-In the box there are: 243 cards, 1 notepad of tracking sheets, 8 player screens, 12 offer tokens, and 6 suspect profile cards. The cards are a good thickness and have, so far, held up to plenty of shuffling. In each case you are only using 70 of the 243 cards so not every card is going to be shuffled every game, which will lead to longer durability. The player screens are good size and have hints on both wings to help you solve the case. The art will be divisive for some I believe. It is not my favorite art style as everyone is a little grotesque and has exaggerated features but I love the washed out sepia tone everything has. The color palette really lends itself to old detective movies.-Final Thoughts-I have never had a bad time playing this game. It was one of my most played games last year and we haven‚Äôt slowed down playing it this year. While most plays have been at 2-4 players, I have played a few games at 6 and still enjoyed my time. For me, piecing the puzzle together will never get old. I enjoy feeling like a genius every time I have an AHA! moment. Awkward guests is not perfect though. Like I mentioned earlier, the art style hasn‚Äôt been a big hit for me or others I have played with. Also the setup and tear down for this game gets old really quick. You have 5 compartments of cards in increments of 50 (1-50,51-100, ‚Ä¶) and before and after each game you have to look through each file to find the specific cards your case needs. It also adds time to the tear down if you want to sort the cards back out after playing. In my opinion the extra setup time is well worth the effort and while tearing down we often discuss what red herrings threw us off the murderer‚Äôs trail. My last con is how much this game asks me to suspend my disbelief. If the police are at the house to be questioned, why aren‚Äôt they solving the case? Why is my list of weapons so large? Obviously, a rope and a blunderbuss would leave vastly different wounds. Every time I sit down to play this game, I simply wave those questions away and focus on the real hard-hitting questions: Who, What, and Why?I would give Awkward Guests 5 stabs in the back out of 5Board or Bust Scale:1 - I would never play this again. I would not give this away as a gift.2 - I would play this game if someone else had a copy but I would not buy it for myself.3 - I would ask to play this game on occasion. Would be happy to receive as a gift or in a trade.4 - I would purchase this game for myself. I can see this getting to the table a few times a year. Always enjoy myself when playing.5 - This is exactly what I want out of a board game. Would never turn down a game and would ask to play regularly. Hard to imagine ever getting rid of this game.",5.0

This is not ""Life"" by any stretch of the imagination. You get a car, you all start at different points, you get stars for.....something. There's charades, there's events you can go to or not go to. It's not Life, it's not even a little bit like Life, if you're looking for a ""Life Junior"", this isn't it. You're better off playing Life and going slowly with your kids, or just get a different game. This is NOT the Jedi you're looking for.",1.0

4944,B00NQQTXW6,R30511SSZZCBCP,Not what we were expecting...,"  I guess we are in the minority, but we weren't fans of this version of the game. Before this  purchase, we bought Monopoly Jr. and loved that it was an easy intro to a beloved game for our younger children. This particular game however, is nothing like the original Life. It's a cute enough game I suppose, but not at all what we were expecting. I would have much rather purchased the original Life for our kids and a children's charade game (since that was the only portion of this version any of us enjoyed). It's not necessarily bad, but if you are expecting this to be an easier version of the original game, it's not.",2.0
4945,B00NQQTXW6,R2QCBKMID0FP33,not impressed,"  I played LIFE growing up, even at a young age, and I loved it.I was not impressed with this game.  I want something easy but a little challenging for my kids.  I would prefer something more as in buying toys, ice cream or school supplies with money instead of visiting or not visiting a playground, museum, etc.  There is really nothing to visit, it is just another space.  My kids were really waiting for something more.  My kids did not do well with the charades either.I would have also liked passing a certain space on the game where it is your birthday and everyone must give you a $1 (as in original LIFE) or you have to buy Mom a birthday gift and pay a $1 to the bank.......Things that relate more to a child's everyday life and wants and needs. This is cheaply made, not that interesting, and yes, as previous reviewers stated, the cheap spinner goes flying everywhere even knocking down the players and everyone has to remember what space they were on.  I may play this again over the summer but afterwards, I will donate it to our church.",2.0
4946,B00NQQTXW6,R3LXJXDTK2MV14,Candy Land  meets the Real World...for Juniors,"  So your kids have graduated from the iconic board game known as Candy Land.  Is it time for them to grow up? Maybe take on some responsibilities?  Manage their money, and use their skills in the Junior world?  Are they ready for Game of Life - Junior?!If your child is 8 and up - like my nephew, he would probably be better off playing Roblox or Minecraft or the adult version of Game of Life (which he won). If your child is under 8, the game may be better if you start off playing along with them instead of against them.Some Gold Stars:>>As far as board illustration it is completely beautiful.  Like Candy Land you want a board that ignites the imagination and I think the board-art in the Game of Life Junior does that well.>>It doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly like the original Game of LIfe.  As a Junior your life should be care-free; eating ice cream at the beach, visiting the zoo after having stuffing your face at the chocolate factory.  Imagination is key here, and I understand why they have those action cards.>>The introduction of money.  There‚Äôs no compound interest or mortgage but just the introduction of money is enough.The game is open for home renditions and rules. Instead of stars use animal crackers. Or try introducing fun-size packaged candy or fruit roll-ups as a side vendor to redeem that money.Some Black Stars:>>The spinner feels cheap, doesn‚Äôt feel random and has no suspense.  It is supposed to spin like a top but there‚Äôs too much friction.  One can control the spin depending on your pressure.  I say trade it in for a Pop-O-Matic (Trouble), or improve the spin, or use a die. I get it the adult life has the same spinner, I say trade that one in as well.>>‚ÄúMy Book of Adventures‚Äù is really just a single card where you place your stars that always seem to fall off. I would suggest that the deluxe version use magnetic backing.>>Some action (charade) cards are too difficult for young children and may prove to be frustrating:Winning a RaceThink of a Song and hum itThink of a Cartoon character and act like itScoring a goalPlaying catchMaking a cakeSack raceCrossing the roadA Circus ClownSpoon and Egg Race>>Certain action cards give two stars.

They really enjoy getting the yellow cards and figuring out what they need to do - sometimes the card gives a $1, sometimes it takes it away, sometimes it gives a star or 2, sometimes takes them away and some cards have you just share your favorite whatever, sometimes you get to act something out or finish singing a song. It's fun!  And we typically finish the game in about 15 minutes.",5.0

This game is a good premise and it's super cute, it just loses its magic when switching from adult to kids.We've only played this twice and she LOVES board games. All of her others are in constant use. I feel that they dumbed it down a little too much to try and help out kids. Some of the action cards are silly.For the most part it's an alright game, but I think we will probably just wait a little longer till she understands the adult version better!",3.0
4950,B00NQQTXW6,R1UX90GBOODZCH,Great junior version of Life,"  This is a great junior edition of the classic game Life. My 5 year old loves it. This game does run a bit different, so reading the directions is important. My child loves the action cards. I like that they include a symbol that allows my child to identify if its something she needs to look at the picture to act out, or something that needs to be read to her. It helps allow this game be more independent where otherwise all the reading would make it a bit more of a challenge. The money is just $1 bills, so I cannot say this game helps with learning how to use money at all. Wish it at least worked with some other bills, and a little counting besides to 6 to move the car. My only negative comments are the spinner does not stay on the board, and I have lost track how many times it goes flying out of place when my child spins it. The colors on the spinner are not attached with the numbers, which makes the colors not line up right when you spin, which is also confusing. Overall, great game. And happy I found it.",5.0
4951,B00NQQTXW6,R3GDBQFG4JJ0OB,NOT even similar to the adult version,  My son received Monopoly Junior and it‚Äôs perfect - a version for kids that‚Äôs easy to play and understand. I therefore figured I‚Äôd get the Game of Life Junior and this is.... bizarre. It‚Äôs easy enough to play but not at all even similar to the original. It makes no sense what you‚Äôre playing for or competing for. You act things out and get a star if someone guesses right? What is no one guesses right - how long does the guessing go? What incentive do people have to guess right if they don‚Äôt get a star? But that‚Äôs just one of the many absurd/silly components. I wish I could return it because it‚Äôs nonsensical and no fun.,1.0

Even though it‚Äôs Life Junior, I found it pretty different from the regular Life but still really fun once everyone gets the hang of it.

You don‚Äôt get to add people/family members to your car, you don‚Äôt get to choose a job... it‚Äôs the game of life for little children who move around town trying to get to all of the activities possible. My 8 year old is bored by this version, and my 5 year old is also underwhelmed. It‚Äôs more of a game for preschool children in my opinion.",3.0
4956,B00NQQTXW6,R24MKGVLKB7V76,Bonding and fun game,"  Fun game for the whole family! However, I wish the makers of the game would fix the way you keep track of who is winning. The stars on the star card is a complete joke! Did you even test to see how well they stayed in place? Yes, let's give the kids a small card to put stars that fit a certain way and see If it stays that way. The answer is never.

4972,B085WL4LMG,RF6TMQO8FZ3MM,Love everything about it... except the game itself,"  This game was definitely made by fans.  The Delorean.  The Clocktower.  The fading picture.  It's all here.  Unfortunately this game is super swingy.  I've played plenty of difficult dice chuckers, from Elder Sign to Pathfinder Adventures, but this one seems exceptionally punishing.The game manual itself recommends that you spend early turns doing side objectives in order to build up extra powers for future turns.  Extra powers=more actions per turn.  The problem is, everything in the game (except for movement) is done with a dice roll and there is a 1/3 chance that you roll a Biff, which not only fails whatever it is you're doing, but also causes Biff to set you further behind.  So in the crucial first turns of the game you can complete challenges and gain 1 to 2 extra actions for future turns or you can fail the challenge, waste your turn, still be stuck with the starting 5 powers, have the trouble card messing up your game because you failed to clear it, AND have Biff set you further behind.Even fighting Biff is a dice roll, so if Biff is causing too much damage and you try to stop him, you can roll even more Biffs.  This can lead to a completely unwinnable situation within the first several turns. I had a two-player game where it ended with the love meter at -4 (the lowest it can go, you need 13-15 to win) AND the Delorean still in the starting space (we did get the 3 car parts at least).  That is not just losing the game, that is elderly grandpa fighting Mike Tyson levels of obliteration.  It was not even close.I've been trying out different house rules to figure out the best way to play it because the theme and components in the game are fantastic.  If you're a Back to the Future fan, pick this one up.  If you're looking for a good co-op game, try Horrified or Pandemic.",3.0
4973,B085WL4LMG,R24BBOR8VONELU,Great concept captures the essence of the movie,  I love this game. Took a few attempts to understand all of the rules (and there are quite a few) but if you're a BTTF fan you will love this.,5.0
4974,B085WL4LMG,R58IJF6IGBW6I,You will love this game win or lose!,"  I am a huge fan of both Back to the Future, and table top board gaming.  I am no stranger to games that are made out of an existing franchise.  Sometimes it is done very poorly, and sometimes it is done well.  This game does a good job!  When you turn a story into a game. You have to capture the essence, while not making it a boring game.  It can't be too word for word the movie, and it can't stray too far from the source material.It is clever to have Einstein and Jennifer join the group so you can have a 4 player game, and not have it restricted to 2 (Marty and Doc).  Unique abilities with each player make replay a must.  The randomness of the challenges, and perks you can acquire can really make the game a nail biter.  Our first play through it was down the wire.... and we lost!  I still had so much fun.  The board is a very cute representation of Hill Valley, even complete with pop up clocktower that doubles has a dice tower!!!! So well thought out.I love that as you continue to fail your main objectives, the iconic family photo begins to show Mary's family disappearing in a clever way.The components are nice, the Delorean is detailed, the character models are unique.  This game has a great art style that is it's own but pays a good homage to the artistic direction of the movies themselves.AND I CAN'T FORGET The rule book is disguised as the comic Tales from Space featured in the film!Even the board has a nice visual queue when opening for the first time as you get a nice shot of the flux capacitor.All in all this game is fun to play, follows the narrative well, and is a great cooperative experience for you and your friends/family.  Working together is what makes this game great!",5.0
4975,B085WL4LMG,R335J2F36ZZD4R,Game of the Year (if you're a Back to the Future fanatic!),"  Bought this game as a gift for my husband for Father's Day. It was a BIG hit and we had such a fun time playing it as a family.It's cooperative, so you're all on the same team working together to get George & Lorraine to fall in love, the DeLorean fixed up and into position in time for lightning to strike at 10:04pm, all while dodging Biff and his gang who are out making trouble.It's super theme-tastic, and we were up on our feet shouting at the dice by the end of the game. SO much fun!!",5.0
4976,B085WL4LMG,R2SGXDA6UXDMUI,Requires house rules,"  Theme alone is 5 stars. Combine that with excellent components (also 5 stars) and you really feel like you‚Äôre in the movie!Well you would feel like you‚Äôre in the movie if the film ended with Marty failing and disappearing out of existence in 1955. Gameplay is a 1 star. It is incredibly punishing for anyone that isn‚Äôt insanely lucky (which I‚Äôm not). The first play through (2 players) ended with the love meter at the starting spot, the delorean almost to Doc‚Äôs house (halfway to where it needs to be to win), and the only accomplishment being that we collected all 3 parts. Our second game (3 players) ended 3 rounds before the endgame when everyone quit because realistically there was no way to achieve a victory - we were just too far behind and every roll just set us back further. I don‚Äôt think this game was playtested for balance, and that is a shame because clearly a lot of time was spent on components and theme - it does such an amazing job of honoring the film.Without house rules this game just isn‚Äôt fun. We tested house rules like rerolling one biff, or when you acquire a power tile you can immediately use it, which helped the experience.I hope there is a second edition at some point with a rule adjustment, I love Back to the Future and good strategic co-ops, so I want to be able to love this game. Fingers crossed.",3.0
4977,B085WL4LMG,R3ID8CU5JHPCZJ,"Great Scott, that was fun!","  What‚Äôs not to love about a Back to the Future themed board game? The components are fun, and although it may look daunting to infrequent board gamers because of all of the different pieces, it is not that complicated. We highly recommend the advice of the game makers - complete the opportunity challenges first thing.  You need the extra power tiles and items help, too.  Focus on the love meter and get it moving, and keep an eye on what is coming up on the time track.  It‚Äôs true that luck of the die plays a significant role, but efficiency in accomplishing the two main tasks (moving the love meter and moving the Delorean), rolling extra dice (for the wildcard lightning bolt), and active coordination and sharing power tokens in clutch moments, really help. We played three times and won each time, without resort to House rules.",5.0
4978,B085WL4LMG,R3IRNB3FJ7H0D2,Back to the Future in a Box!,"  Sure, my headline is the most cliche, clickbaity thing you can think of. However, I truly feel transported into the movie when I am playing this game. This coop board game will get you and your friends and/or families high-fiving when you complete a challenge, but flipping the table when Biff comes over and messes you up.The lovely designers of Prospero Hall have knocked it out of the park with this one. I have played Jaws before and knew when I saw this new release that they would do the IP justice. I had just watched the movie a few weeks before playing the game so my Back to the Future fervor was at an all-time high.First off, the game is pretty simple to learn. Your character has several ""power tiles"" at the start which tell you what you can do on your turn. On all the starter ones, you can either move or use a dice in a ""challenge."" You'll be running around the board trying to gather parts for the Delorean and ensuring Lorraine and George stay in love before time runs out. What's not to love?Well, good ole Biff is running around trying to ruin your plans. And oh man, if you hated him in the movies, you'll hate him even more in this game. Everything you do, he is there ready to reverse anything you've done. Whenever you do a challenge which typically involves helping George and Lorraine or trying to pick up the parts, you can roll ""Biffs"" on the dice which will move him towards George and/or Lorraine. When he gets to their spot, he will drop their love on the love meter. You need to keep this high but he will be constantly lowering over and over again.I don't want to go over all the rules, but I'll say for the price, the components are really good. The art on the cards is not just movie stills, but instead are custom images made for the game. I haven't assembled the Clock Tower dice tower since I heard it is a little fragile, but everything else is great quality. Pick this up if you are a Back to the Future fan!",5.0

4980,B085WL4LMG,R34PKRCH34Z69I,GREAT cooperative play game,"  Fan of  ""Back To The Future"" movie or not, this is an engaging, challenging, but most of all FUN game to play. Excellent cooperative game play with many ways to interact with fellow players. Excellent quality game board and all components, right down to the highly detailed DeLorean that is an essential part of the game. For those who are fans of the movie, there are many play details which emulate scenes from the movie that actually enhance game play. There are also excellent strategy elements to the game which add to the challenge of the game. This is a game definitely geared toward those above the age of 10. or those kids who can grasp and retain multiple game rules when playing. Excellent family entertainment. Funko hit this one out of the park. HIGHLY recommended.",5.0
4981,B085WL4LMG,R2CW6BBHUVAM14,Great Game! Very Back to the Futurey,"  In the last year 2 games have come out that have been affordable, kind of by the same people, and have become my favorite games. Horrified was the first and this is the second. The components are great, rules are explained well, game play is fun and easy to learn, and somehow they've made the theme come alive. The game has you allocating dice to challenges while avoiding Biff who is on the board and moves around trying to take away your progress.Note that this can be challenging, especially for people who do not play a lot of board games. IMO I still think that if you do fit into this category and find it difficult and you keep losing I would hang in there. I believe that the game is so sound and fun that even non-gamers wil get better at it and find winning doable.",5.0

The artwork is really great also.  Having watched the movie as a kid it was a neat little adventure ‚Äúback in time‚Äù.My only beef, and thus the four star rating, was the poorly designed clock tower dice tower which is kind of a pain to set up and make use of due to poor design.  Midway through our first game we just stopped using it.  I guess at this price point some corner cutting is to be expected on a board game with this many components but it‚Äôs unfortunate something like that is ever noticeable.",4.0

4992,B085WL4LMG,RVTBRF1JTZ2FI,Not only a good Back to the Future Game (finally) - but a great co-op game!,"  This game is an absolute blast- let me tell you why.  First off- game is well designed with player powers- and power tiles that turn into dice rolls/allocation or other powers (like rerolling the dreaded Biff dice rolls- or more movement).  The game takes place in 1955- and the kitch-art is awesome- and the look and feel of the game just oozes with theme.  The four main characters to play as are Doc, Marty, Einstein, and Jennifer. (i know Jennifer & Einstein weren't really there in the film- but it works in the game)  They are all super different with asymmetrical powers- and each really lends themselves to securing victory by either moving the DeLorian, helping George and Lorraine fall in love, or scare Biff away.  Cool small opportunity cards pop up over the town- allowing you to level your character up- and the cards bring up some of the best moments in the movie!  This game is a 5/5 for me- but warning - it's not a cake walk! I've won only once out of five games- but when you win- it feels awesome.",5.0
4993,B085WL4LMG,R1F940BE9L1K9W,Cooperative is a perfect fit for Back to the Future,"  We love cooperative board games. And the theme of this game is a perfect fit for cooperative play. You work together to get George and Lorainne to fall in love and get the DeLorean to the starting spot before lightning strikes the Clock Tower. It's a dice rolling game, so there's an element of luck that makes every game turn out differently.The first time we played, we cruised to a victory. But the next time, we were failing everywhere.

Upon setting it up to play, there isn't really anything more to do than match cards of the same color together. You don't use the map in any way. You don't use the continent boards in any. It is literally draw 7 cards (that happen to have country names on them) and match four of the same color together and repeat.

5008,B077LZ69YZ,R127NTXIESVCKF,A great game for people who want to learn Geography,"  Our family loves this game. I have a degree in Geography and I wanted to share my love of the world and its cultures with my children. But, learning Geography starts with the basics of knowing where everything is before you can understand how environments and the people who reside there interact, and how conflicts arise from that. I wish I'd had this game to prepare for my location tests in college; studying would have been a lot more fun. Keep in mind that this game is NOT a mindless entertainment game. If you're not interested in learning Geography, this game will be tedious.Pros:-A fun way to learn world Geography for anyone old enough to read (Geography quizzes are NOT fun and that's the best alternative to this game.)-Great instructions and decent construction of the game materials.-Great for classroom or homeschool learning.-Different levels are built in for varying skill levels (my nine-year-old loves the challenge of the orange mystery cards.)Cons:-World Geography is continually changing so this game could be outdated in a few years. (An app version is in development and would manage this problem)-It was VERY thoughtful that they included plastic bands to put around and store the cards but an earth-friendly compostable alternative would be better.-Our biggest disappointment was that the country information on the cards is too basic. The flags are great but they could at least include capitals too. (We will probably write the capitals on the cards ourselves.)-Although there are increasing skill levels we felt we weren't challenged enough and the game ended too soon (but I guess that's partially a pro because we didn't want it to end!)",4.0

This was not what I expected.  It is a nice, quality game but the point of it is to collect sets of four color matching cards and one set of two.  It was so confusing to start because I thought there must be more to it, but no.  The map and continent/country lists are completely superfluous from the game.  My toddler likes it, so we're keeping it, but it is not really worth the $35 cost.  Kudos that a portion goes to charity but this game is 1.5-2 times more expensive than other quality learning games such as those from Peaceable Kingdom.  To make the game better we study all the countries on the map and go over the flag and capital.  I really wish I had better things to say about it.  If you're on the fence, skip.",3.0

5058,B014Q1XX9S,RUSQTN7T0HGLQ,Hard game to play unless you don‚Äôt mind a lot of downtime.,"  We are gamers, I own almost 100 games.  I was excited to try this game due to the high rating.  It was an epic fail. First you have to try to give clues that are only for your group of cards and none of the other teams.  You give a one word clue that is suppose to relate to one or more cards (only you know which ones) and your partner better have the same thought train.  The guessers complained we took too long between giving clues UNTIL the next game when they became the clue givers and saw it wasn‚Äôt easy.  This is not a fun light hearted game and I doubt young children could play at all.",1.0
5059,B014Q1XX9S,R39YV671BF5GBA,A deceptively awesome game for four or six players,"  I admit I wasn't particularly excited when I saw the initial reviews and playthroughs of this game. The name/theme make it sound like a hidden role type of game a la The Resistance, but that's really not what it is. The theme is spy-based, sure, but only to make this more interesting than a generic word game. Nothing about it besides the artwork makes you feel like you're playing as or against a spy.What this game IS, however, is a very solid word game with a little bit of deduction, press your luck, and ""party"" thrown in.In short, the game plays like this: two teams, each with a clue-giver (spymaster) and one or more guessers. On the table are 25 random words. Each spymaster is trying to give their team one-word clues that help them relate one or more of the words on the table together (without saying the actual words, of course) so that the guessers can figure out which of the random words are affiliated with their team (only the spymasters know this information). The spymaster hopes their team will pick the words that they intended based on their clue without picking cards affiliated with the enemy team, neutral words, or the ""spy"" word, which immediately ends the game. Whichever team can identify all their words first wins.As an example, a clue of ""animal"" might be great if you're trying to get your team to guess ""cat"" and ""dog"", but horrible if the opposing team also controls the ""lion"" card. On the other hand, maybe the word ""pet"" gives just enough information about a cat and a dog without also implicating lion. Should you risk it?A little tricky to explain in one paragraph, maybe, but takes about 2 minutes to teach to a group in person.Personally, I think this game works best with 4 or 6 players, where each team has a spymaster and 1-2 guessers. We tried playing it with 8 and in my opinion having that many guessers on each team does nothing to enhance the experience of the game. Instead, it felt to me like a lot of people sat and waited around while each of the spymasters tried to come up with good clues, then argued more than was necessary about which cards to guess.Despite the fact that this game appears ""meh"" based on the concept, it's a lot of fun to play. Spymasters will agonize over what clue can safely implicate their own cards on the table without overlapping (and therefore helping) those of the opposing team. Teams will struggle to come up with the logic that the spymaster *must* have used, some wrong guesses will be made, hilarity (and frustration) will likely ensue.There is some downtime when the spymasters take a while to come up with their clues, so be prepared for that. Otherwise this game is a blast and easily one of the best in my collection under the $20 price point. I have no doubt I'll be able to pull this out with any type of group (gaming, friends, family, work, etc.) and have a great time. It is a must buy at retail price ($20) or less.(***Note: This review is for the original Codenames, and NOT Codenames: Pictures. Amazon combined the listings after I wrote this review***)",5.0
5060,B014Q1XX9S,R2U41ZSFK7HCG,A Review For 2 Player Games,"  This review is specifically for those thinking of playing it as a two player game. Codenames is a clue giving and partner solving game where the clue giver will say a word and a number. For example: animal, three. Laid out will be twenty five cards with secret agent codenames written on them. In my example I am indicating that there are three codenames related to the word animal. Hopefully my partner will guess which three cards/codenames they are. 12 of the cards/codenames are designated for the red team. 12 for the blue. And 1 for the assassin. If your partner picks the card that is associated with the assassin the game ends immediately. In a two player game there is no other team. So you and your partner pick which team you will be (blue or red). You then get 8 turns to try and ""beat"" the game. To make the game harder you could make the number of turns you get lower. The game is still enjoyable as a 2 player game, but it is more fun when playing against another team of investigators. I would guess that expansion cards will come since if you play enough you will start cycling through the same codenames/cards. For a 2 player game I would recommend this.",4.0
5061,B014Q1XX9S,RBR1M9M3HZHOL,It's a fantastic party game because it can be taught in under ...,"  Codenames really is genius in it's simplicity. It's a fantastic party game because it can be taught in under 5 minutes and provides a ton of fun. It has definitely been a hit in my gaming group and with my family over the holidays.Two players are chose as the ones giving the rest of their team clues while the rest desperately try to make sense of what they are talking about. A 5x5 grid of word cards is laid out and then using a key card that shows what words are for each team and which ones are bystanders or an assassin, the clue givers take turns saying a clue word and a number which indicates how many of their team words are related to the clue. The team guesses and the clue giver places a token on their guesses corresponding to the red team, blue team, bystander, or assassin. The first team to cover all their words wins, though guessing the assassin automatically makes you lose.The game is surprising simple, but provides hours of entertainment, especially as everyone laughs over the connections that everyone makes.I cannot recommend it enough!",5.0

5064,B014Q1XX9S,R1YK7F1TLKO1P6,The hit of Christmas!,"  Gifted this for Christmas and it was the first game we played after opening several others.  We really like it!  It's a great game that can be played with a large variety of people which we like for our family of 9 that ranges in age from 8 to 60.  It's nice because the kids can play (on the guessing side) too.  We like it because it goes fast (15 minutes or less) and has just the right amount of strategy without being overly complicated.  I recommend just YouTubing the instructional video and then playing your first round, it's quick to learn.  One thing I noticed is it's very easy to ""table talk"" in this game so we did have to institute a silent rule hah!  But maybe that's just us.  But if you're wanted an animated party word game, this isn't the one.  Another thing I really like is that even after you go through all the words, it will never get old because they'll be paired with different words every time.  Looking forward to playing this again and maybe even buying my own copy.",5.0
5065,B014Q1XX9S,R229BIPDU6KBI7,Tough game but loads of fun and replayability,"  Codenames plays as a team based spy themed game where you have to think of a single word clue that can distinguish as many of your teams cards as possible. Unlike fast paced games like Taboo, this allows you to think and plan out what word or association will drive your team in the right direction while avoiding the other team's cards and making sure they never guess the one assassin card (instant lose card).Although the theme is spies, the game play is all about word associations and knowing your team. The code master is allowed 1 word followed by a number. Example turn would be code master says ""Tree:3"" for Apple, Leaf, Paper. Multiple worded clues are allowed if it is a proper noun (New York).The game is a blast. You use 25 (5x5) cards each time, each card is double sided. The good thing is even if you reuse words in future games, a quick shuffle/flip sides makes the card association unique each play through giving this game huge replay-ability. Although this game can be tough and some code masters may have a hard time getting 3 or even 2 associations, I highly recommend this game.",5.0
5066,B014Q1XX9S,R31SNN357IGN5C,Team game play with a lot of laughs...,"  This is a great party game. The concept is you form teams, and the team leader gives out one word clues to help their team guess which words belong to the team. Guessing wrong could give points to the other team, could be benign and simply end the turn, or could be disastrous and end the game. Discussions about which words to choose can be side-splittingly funny, so it's hard to keep a poker face as a team lead.The number of clue and word cards are generous so you can play this over and over.

5067,B014Q1XX9S,RP0KCSZJ1OG5E,They love playing it and said that it's a fast game ...,  I bought this for my sister's family and unfortunately found out they already had not only 1 but 2 copies of it! They love playing it and said that it's a fast game that you can play many times in a row and a great way to get to know people better.Update: We played the game (along with many others) for New Years Eve and it's a fun game. It definitely goes quick. We played it without using the timer but I can see why they have that as part of the game as some turns could just last forever when there's no time-crunch. They have an age limit of 10 years old minimum and I can understand why. It requires some very creative thinking for how to connect multiple words both to come up with them as well as try to guess what your partner meant. You may be able to change the rules for under 10 and only try to get your opponent to guess one agent at a time,5.0
5068,B014Q1XX9S,R2NO88VF60WROH,I don't think it lives up to the hype,"  This is a very good game don't get me wrong but I feel like it's a bit overhyped. This was on almost all lists when I was googling party games. My group didn't really ask to play again, it was always kind of like a ""well we could play Codenames again"".Pros:-When playing with people from very different backgrounds it is hilarious to see which connections they make. You might have a hint that could get you 3 cards but makes 0 connections with your team. This caused a lot of playful squabbles.-The game is very easy to setup and teach. No one really needed further explanation once we got started.-The game design in terms of it's pieces is very solid. After the first board you just flip the cards and draw a new spymaster card and you are back in the game.-I will say this is a game where you feel like you got your money's worth. I paid $15 and you get a very complete game for that price.Cons:-We played this sober and then after drinking for a while. I will say this is probably not a game for a party with drinking. Its just a bit too cerebral and not really that funny for a drinking crowd.-There aren't really those surprise moments like other social deduction style games. This is probably the game you start with to transition into other games.Overall the price of this game makes it hard to turn away. I don't think this will be your favorite game in the genre but I think its a safe game to pick up. I feel like if you could make your own cards (which is easily possible) you could make a hilarious version of this game for older crowds.",4.0
5069,B014Q1XX9S,RIBXGGB5Z8265,New favorite game!!!,"  Our friends brought this to one of our Game Nights, and I have to admit that I was a little skeptical based on corny ""spy"" theme and the overall look of the packaging. Boy oh boy, was a I pleasantly surprised!! In a nutshell, I loved this game for its simplicity in pieces (no crazy board or obnoxious amount of accessories) and its requirement to creatively think.The Rules:1. Prepare the board. To do this, you simply lay out 25 white cards in a 5 by 5 grid.2. Divide into two teams: red and blue. We had a group of 4, so we did 2 teams of 2. On each team, nominate one person to be the clue-giver. All remaining players are the guessers.3. Let the clue-givers (one for each team) pick the one code-breaker card. This will essentially map the grid of white cards by assigning which cards belong to which team. For example, this means that the clue-giver on the red team is going to have to get the red team guesser(s) to guess the cards that are tagged as red.  In addition to noting which of the 25 white cards are red and which are blue, the code-breaker card also selects one that is black (the assassin).  If any guesser names the black card, the game is over. Untagged cards remain white. They are neutral, meaning that nothing happens if they are guessed.4. Let the first team start. The clue-guesser must look at all of the cards that have been tagged to their team, and with one word, try to have the guesser(s) on their team say as many of the cards.  The guessers look to all 25 cards, and not knowing which belong to their team, which belong to the other team, and which is the black assassin, try to name only cards that belong to their team.Example: The cards lips, lemon, mango, and ear are 4 cards on the 25 card grid. You are giving the clues and lips and lemon are tagged to your team. Mango and ear are tagged to the other team. This means you want to try to get your teammate(s) to say lemon and/or lips and NOT mango nor ear.  If you say ""flavor"" it is not enough to distinguish between lemon and mango. If say ""body part"" it is not enough to distinguish between ear and lips. But maybe the clue ""pucker"" could be enough?!5. Continue in this manner, going back and forth, until one team identifies all of their cards. That team is the winner!One thing I will note is that this game can move along rather slowly, because of its requirement to think. This means there can be a lot of downtime while you are waiting for the clue giver to come up with their clue. We were OK with this, but you might want to have some music or TV on in the background.",5.0
5070,B014Q1XX9S,R10SVRRTMLCCGL,One of my favorite games! Want an expansion,"  Pros:- Extremely easy to learn- Usable for a diverse group, all ages (though a kid might have some trouble but they could participate on one of the teams)- Good clean fun: safe for work cards, could be played at family gatherings/company parties- Overall just fantastic game- Everyone I have played with has seemed to love it- Uses your brain, extremely interesting concept- Transportable, it can pack up into a small bag or something for when you want to bring it on the goCons:- I really want an expansion for Codenames. We have the afterdark version and the picture version, but we like the original best and it's the best for family gatherings. However after playing for several years now, we have seen a lot of the cards many times and we would love a several hundred card expansion for this game. I know technically I could make that myself with notecards, but if I could just buy the expansion and keep the cards consistent in size and quality that would be great :P.  After dozens of games, the replay-ability does go down a little, and it can get repetitive. If there was another card pack, that would immediately fix the issue.- Sometimes the code master is slow between rounds when deciding a clue, and they get salty when you pull out the timer. It can be hard to think of pairing words sometimes. Occasionally the match ups will be unfair, with someone getting 5 easily connectable words in one go, and another person with completely unrelated words that seem near impossible to connect in any way. Not really a big deal though, that's how games go sometimes.5/5 stars. No shipping issues or damage to the box.",5.0
5071,B014Q1XX9S,R29TBZINA98Z7Z,As weird as it sounds this game is so much fun,"  I was pretty on the fence when my family first ordered this game. It seemed pretty simple and like something we'd get easily board of ( even though we adore family game night).But it turns out this game is packed full of laughs, inside jokes and challenges.  Perfect to play with anyone ages 9 + and definitely a lot of fun for adults and families.While the game is the most fun with piers  I did play the game with two adults and two 9 year old girls.  The two girls enjoyed it greatly and had a blast coming up with their spy names and imagining what their secret mission was.Ended up making way for a great geography lesson and discussion about how some words have different meanings in different places.Would highly recommend",5.0
5072,B014Q1XX9S,R2NRQIZAVDWQ9F,Love this game,"  Love this game! Fellow teacher bought it for her classroom and we had so much fun with the students playing it that I got my own! I have played it with classes from 5th grade-12th grade. My 9 year old son loves it and my 18 year old daughter took it to a teen game night because she likes the game so much. Several of the students have even asked their parents to get it for their own homes! The concept of the game seems simple and whoever goes first should win-if only! How players relate to each other, how old they are, and what they are interested in plays a big part in how clues need to be given for correct guesses. Strategy is a huge part and you have to think of how your partner would connect things when giving clues. We have played with as few as 3 players and as many as 10 (5 on each team) in one hand although I think with a little adjustment you could set up several tables and have several groups going at once there are so many cards that you can use-only hold back would be the little holder for the map card-although we find that clue givers like to hold it sometimes to make it easier to figure their cards out and pass it back and forth. If you have only 3-it is very challenging for the clue giver to keep the cards straight as they have to connect for one player ""red"" cards and the other ""blue"" cards-which keeps them switching thought processes. A normal game only takes 5-10 minutes. There are 25 cards laid out in the grid and after a game is over, the kids like to look at the cards to see relationships and ways that they could give clues that would include the most cards with leaving out the cards that they don't want picked. This is a great game for seeing relationships between different words and figuring out ways to make them connect! Can't wait for adult game night to see how a table of adults will do with it! There are 1000's of combinations so there is never 2 games twice!!",5.0
5073,B014Q1XX9S,R2IGCAGEGPEEMT,Not bad once you get the concept,"  As someone who appreciates word games and board games, I wasn't a big fan of Codenames. I actually thought it was something similar to Mafia (spymasters, dreaded assassin, and the posing of the two characters on the box). But my sister was the one who corrected me and said it's nothing like Mafia. It's more like Pyramid and Taboo with a whole lot of luck thrown in.I've played with my family for several times and it took awhile before my parents and I completely understood the rules. You play in teams, using 25 word cards laid out in front of you on the table. You draw a key card (can be flipped left or right to make for new patterns) and whichever color team you are on, you follow the pattern on the card. You take turns giving one word clues for your partner whereupon they must use that word to deduct what word(s) you had in mind. You can go big and use one key word for 5 cards if you wish - but it's at your risk. If your partner happens to guess the dreaded assassin word, then you automatically lose. While it sounds generally simple, it really isn't.It's definitely more of a luck game and how well do you know how your partner thinks. The guesser has a harder job than the clue-giver. I was frustrated by a few aspects of the game - the bolded words on the card only face in one direction while a lighter repetition of the word is on the other side. So only one pair can directly read the words while the other pair have to read the words at an angle. The key cards are a little hard to coordinate. You have to make sure the other clue giver is aware of which row of cards on the floor corresponds to which row of cards on the key card. We had several mishaps because of this. And I found it really hard to keep track of which words were mine - I had to write them onto a piece of paper and make sure my words didn't relate too much to my opponent's, otherwise your partner might guess a word that is for the opposing team! Not even sure where that timer comes into play because we took forever in giving and guessing clues.I guess because words can be interpreted in so many different ways and there are so many different patterns, you can use this set for some time before it gets old. I kind of feel silly now because I thought this was a strategy board game - I sent one to somebody for Secret Santa ‚Ä¶ hopefully they liked it? I do agree that this game would be better suited for older teens and adults. Not sure if I can see younger children getting into it.",3.0
5074,B014Q1XX9S,R2GCM0GDP7DX2D,Don‚Äôt recommend,"  My friends and I didn‚Äôt enjoy this game. Giving clues is so easy and so is guessing them. Your turn ends when your timer ends or your team guesses wrong. My team guessed all the words to ‚Äúwin‚Äù before the sand timer was even done, not giving the second team a chance. When we started a new game with the other team, THEY won everything without my team having a chance due to how easy the words were. We followed the rules, gave clues for the words and finished a round in 5 minutes. Really boring and I don‚Äôt recommend. I‚Äôm not sure why it has so many good reviews.",1.0
5075,B014Q1XX9S,RFOT2S9Q4BCDU,"Very engaging, fun, and challenging","  Wow, wasn't sure what to expect when got this game.  I was looking for some games to play with the family when they call came in for the holiday break.  This one had good ratings and reviews, so figured would give it a try.We were all really surprised at how fun and yet really challenging this game is.  We were playing with 2 teams of 3, and found that it was a little challenging for the 10 year old; but she did surprisingly well.  Be aware, the better you are at vocabulary, and your use of the English language, the better you will be at this game.  It also helps if you are playing with people you know, since it's all about making word association/connections.  We found out that the sisters were really good at it (they knew what each other was thinking), and the guys were good teams, because we all knew generally what the other was thinking.It takes a couple minutes to get the playing area set up, and a game takes about 15-20 minutes, depending on how quickly each team takes to make their guesses.Overall; we really enjoyed, we played it several times over several days throughout the 2 week holiday break.  And will probably play again the next time we get everyone together.",5.0
5076,B014Q1XX9S,R1VFWR0M3551E4,Not fun after second playing,"  We really enjoyed this game the very first time we played it with our kids.  We loved it so much that when we had some friends come over to play games, we taught them this game.  However, at that point, we realized this game was actually no fun at all!  The other couple immediately began just clue-ing one card at a time until they got them all.  And then we tried playing again, and this time WE just kept clue-ing one card at a time until we got tired of it and I just folded up the game and said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play cards‚Äù.  At first I thought this game was great, but it ended up being a waste of money.  I guess you could make a rule that you HAVE to clue more than one word at a time....but then sometimes that literally gets impossible.  This game is probably best played with grade school or middle school children.  High schoolers and adults will see right through it for an easy win.",2.0
5077,B014Q1XX9S,R3K82MSN3PWSRO,Team game play with alot of laughs,"  This is a great party game.  The concept is you form teams, and the team leader gives out one word clues to help their team guess which words belong to the team. Guessing wrong could give points to the other team, could be benign and simply end the turn, or could be disastrous and end the game. Discussions about which words to choose can be side-splittingly funny, so it's hard to keep a poker face as a team lead.The number of clue and word cards are generous so you can play this over and over. In addtion, Clue cards can be used 4 different ways and word cards are double sided.  Game play is fast paced, you can easily get through a round in 15 minutes if you used the enclosed timer to keep guesses moving. This game was an instant hit for our family.",5.0
5078,B014Q1XX9S,RJOC2FTYEX8W9,This game is addictive!,"  My sister and her husband bought this game and brought it to my house for a family get-together. I couldn't get enough of it, so after they left I bought my own. This is my new favorite game. It's very simple to learn and play, plus the possibilities are endless with the cards. You play with two teams. You can play with an odd number of people.  Each team has a color and gets a set of colored cards...one set  is red and one is blue. You lay out 25 word cards, each with a word on it. You take a graph card from the pile of graph cards and only one player from each team can see it; these two people are the clue-givers for their teams. The graph card has 25 squares; some are blue, some red, some beige and one is the assassin. The first clue-giver gives a clue that should help his/her team say as many words that (according to the graph) are their color as possible. For instance, if you see the words ""frog"", ""bunny"" and ""sock"" you might give the clue ""hop"" and say the number three so your team knows there are three words you associated with the word hop. Your team then points to the cards, one by one, they think you are describing. If the card they point to is your color, you cover it up with your color card. If it is the other team's color card, they get to put their color card on it and your turn passes to them. If one is a neutral, your turn passes to the other team. If one is the assassin, the game is over and the other team is declared the winner. The first person to place all their color cards on the board wins. It's fun to see how others think and the associations they come up with!",5.0

5080,B014Q1XX9S,RT31ZPCA8IS2T,Infinite replay value. READ THIS IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT NEGATIVE COMMENTS!,"  I LOVE this game and have gotten all of my friends and family hooked! It takes a second to learn to play, and is best learned from someone who has played before, but once you understand, it's so fun! The best part is, you could play it over and over and the board will NEVER be the same twice (which is a problem with other games I have because after a while, you learn the cards and it gets boring). HIGHLY recommend!Update: I was reading the negative comments about this game and wanted to clear a few things up.1. This game says best for 2+ people but in reality, it's best with 6-10 people. If you're only getting it to play in your two-person household, it might be more difficult.2. The rules are complicated, but it makes so much more sense once you start to play and get the hang of it. I would recommend playing with someone who knows how to play or watching a YouTube video on how to play because the written rules can be hard to understand.3. This is a thinking game, which I enjoy but it's not everyone's cup of tea. This is not really a ""drunk house party"" game but I've brought it to game nights and Christmas parties and it's been a hit every time.4. I've seen a lot of comments about people saying this game was ""too easy"" because they give a clue to guess ONE card and it's ""too obvious."" That is not the point of the game. If you did that, the team to go second would win every time and that would be boring! The point is to give a clue that could tie in AS MANY of your cards that you can tie together in one round. For example: let's say I had cards that were New York, pie, and sweet. I would say ""Apple for 3"" and my teammates would guess which 3 cards on the board could be related to apple. Their official guess is when they touch the card on the board. If they get all 3 cards, great for our team! However, YOU DO NOT GO AGAIN! It's the next team's turn. I saw reviews that said that people would give clues for a single card, get it right, and then go again. What???? So basically they were giving 8-9 single card clues in a row and winning. That is not how you play the game.",5.0

Games are hard to do with some of the people I know, but all of these people enjoyed it: the family members that only begrudgingly play games with us, the friends with short attention spans that can't play games like Catan, and the family members that couldn't figure out or enjoy a game like Concept (a real shame, that game is great).

I just wasn't in the mood to learn that much, so I searched YouTube for a nice intro video. I opted for a three-minute guide (over a twelve-minute alternative) but that was a mistake. The lay flew through the rules without explanation of the ones that seemed arbitrary.Fortunately, someone else realized she had played it before and took lead. I had a LOT of questions at first to get the gameplay and strategy in my head.The outcome? I loved it. It eventually made sense and the strategy options crystallized. I realized that there would have been much better, and more clear ways to describe game play. Had that been done in either the written instructions or video, so much the better. The game is great for those who enjoy word games, and it's highly replayable.

5083,B014Q1XX9S,R2QNBMVU8QQ4UD,This is a party game. The more people the better. I'd say 6 minimum to make it fun,"  The best way to play this is with 2 teams or three or more people. I'd say 12 or 13 at the youngest because you sometimes have to make complicated word associations.If you really get into this game and play it a lot and can get the hang of some of the weird ways to can associate words. My favorite has been tonsils to make my team guess both the word hospital and ice cream.The basics are you lay out the cards as directed and set up the key card showing which are the red cards and which are the blue team. Then each reader tries to get their team to guess their colored words without guessing the other team color, the white or the black(auto loser card).It takes a little time to get the hang of it, but when you do it can be a lot of fun, especially if people are willing to be a little inventive with their word associations.I'd recommend this, but only for large groups who know each other pretty well.

We're in our 20s, but we've played with our parents and our younger siblings just the same. Everyone loves this game. It's perfect for when you have more than 6 people but you still want to play a game everyone can be a part of. There are no eliminations, so everyone is an active player til the end. At the same time, the game is relatively passive, and when it's the other team's turn you don't have to pay all that much attention if you don't want to, and can go ahead chatting or eating or doing whatever else you were doing. It also does a great job of accommodating everyone, no matter how into (or experienced with) the game they are; loosely interested parties can participate just as well as extremely competitive ones. It's always a lot of laughter and it never gets old, with literally infinite board/card combinations.Highly recommend you get this game. You can all learn how to play in like, 5 minutes. My only note is that you should NOT try to play with fewer than 6 people, as it is actually somewhat un-fun if you don't have at least 3 (and preferably 4-6) people on each team.",5.0

5086,B014Q1XX9S,R1FGC441SPJK4Z,ZZZZZZ Boring,"  Buying a game that you have never played before is a risk because it could be hit or miss. After all this is a matter of taste and games have to fit the style of the community of people with whom you play games. With that said here are the Pros and Cons from our group. Pros; Game pieces are nice, good quality print and sturdy. The instructions are very detailed. Cons: It's slow, the field agents get bored waiting for the SpyMasters to think up clues and the game just dragged. You can improve it by setting up the board and having the SpyMasters study the board, and write all the clue words they plan to give ahead of time. This makes the game go quicker. But frankly that's a lot of work.  We did learn something,, we searched You Tube videos for reviews and found several channels that we will use again to determine which games we want to buy next.

I wouldn't recommend it for fewer people than 6, but other reviewers may have more insight on that.The rules are simple and straightforward, so it's easy to learn for the first time, or easy to introduce new friends who have never played before without those friends feeling too intimidated. It's a thinking game, but it isn't super strategy-heavy, so people can still play well enough even when they're a few drinks into the evening. The rounds are relatively fast-paced and it's VERY re-playable, so starting this game isn't a significant time commitment in the way games like Catan or Betrayal or Clue can be.

5090,B01MA5AJY9,RUTEIQ6N4YX0Z,Great Game!,"  I played Dominion for the first time about 4 weeks ago and have played probably 25 hands since. I and my friends enjoy the game quite a bit and would recommend it for everyone who enjoys game playing.That said I do not recommend this edition. It's not a terrible edition if you can get it at a good price, but here are a couple thoughts to consider:1) I have played Dominion, Dominion Prosperity and Dominion Intrigue. Dominion and Dominion Prosperity were very enjoyable. Dominion Intrigue not as much. It had a couple of likable cards, but altogether lacked the flow of the basic game and the smoothness of Prosperity.2) This Edition offers 100 extra base cards to provide for 6 player play. I'm not sure of the exact overall distribution of those 100 cards but six of them are Province cards and none of them are Duchy cards. This does not work out well since it results in 12 Duchy cards and 18 Province cards when the Duke card in Intrigue (for example) relies on duchies. I think the extra Platinum and Colony cards in Prosperity work better to support at least five players comfortably.3) The interior construction of this box stores all of the cards vertically rather than horizontally to conserve space. This results in the cards standing in the card tray less distinctly from one another than with other Dominion editions which store the cards horizontally. This makes the cards in this set more difficult to remove and replace quickly.These things said I love the game, but would recommend basic Dominion and a separately boxed expansion such as Prosperity over this big box solution.I am also anxious to try Seaside and Dark Ages!Update:I have updated this post to 4/5 stars as I have learned through more playing that the Intrigue and basic Dominion cards work together much better when mixed rather than using exclusive Intrigue combinations as I first tried.Also, I want to note that there are currently three different sets of base cards for American editions of Dominion:1)  the original base cards which use large round symbols of coins for treasure cards2)  the updated base cards which are sold in the base card box and have pretty pictures without large coin symbols on treasure cards3)  and the second edition base cards which have both the pretty pictures and mid-sized coin symbols on the treasure cardsThe type contained in the second edition sets such as this one are IMO the best looking. Other posters on Amazon or a Google search can be checked for images. I just want to mention this because since a second edition of Prosperity has not yet been released it is not possible to get a complete set of second edition base cards including Platinum and Colony cards. This might annoy some a bit.Update:  Prosperity is now second edition and I was mistaken about the need for more duchies. 12 is proper, even for 5-6 players.  Dominion has now become my and my friends favorite game.  This is an excellent edition and the best one to start with!  It is still slightly annoying that the cards rest vertically in this box (because they fan out more than in horizontally positioning boxes), but now that I have all the sets I use my own custom box anyway.  5 stars!",5.0
5091,B01MA5AJY9,R3T6QHIZ3TVABG,Better Than Cocaine,  Brother got the Version 1 base game for Christmas and my family fell in love with it so I bought this for after he headed back home. We now have an extra expansion and will not stop playing the game. We keep talking about having an intervention but nobody in the family will quit playing it. I haven't slept in over 3 weeks.,5.0
5092,B01MA5AJY9,RKACFEG5YI4FY,Most Addictive Game Yet,"  I was given the original game of Dominion when it first came out, but for some reason I can't remember, it got put in the basement and was never played.  I came across an article of the top 10 must owned games and found it in the basement.  When I looked online and saw there was a second edition, I decided to get this instead of using the 1st edition one.My friends and family have instantly become addicted.  My family has played this almost every night for the past 6 months.  My friends love this as well.  There are so many scenarios and different deck combinations that it feels like a different game every time.My 2 favorite aspects of this game are the easy setup, and scoring.  Too many games require too much too setup and calculators to score.  This game is simple in both aspects.  The best part is that scoring is actually cleaning up too!  2 for one deal in my opinion.Be warned though, this has set off a chain of purchasing the 10+ expansions.  However, each is definitely worth getting, with Empires probably being my favorite and Renaissance a close 2nd.I made a decision to sleeve each card in the beginning, which proved to be a lot of work since the beginning, but the cards have preserved very well.Recently I converted all the boxes to 2 big boxes to made it easier to play with every expansion since I got tired of opening 6 different boxes to cleanup and setup each game, but that was a HUGE project in itself.Great Game Overall, I can't wait for more expansions.  My biggest regret is not playing it when I first got it and getting to enjoy each expansion in its own right at release.  It has been a lot to learn and buy them all over the past 6 months.",5.0
5093,B01MA5AJY9,R3DV78S2U6EEJJ,Amazing Company - Great Game - Fantastic Value,"  My wife bought this game for my birthday. She contacted the company directly and they were super helpful. Recommended this set specifically, and I couldn't be happier!I cannot say enough about this game. If you're interested in Dominion, this set is the way to go. I've played some other expansions and I feel like Intrigue is definitely up there as one of the best. The original itself is enough to keep you entertained for quite awhile. The set as a whole gives you near limitless types of game play.It's easy to learn and has a very high level of replay-ability. We've played countless times in the last few months and it's yet to get stale.",5.0
5094,B01MA5AJY9,RMHSHKOQMHHNC,One of My All Time Favorite Games + Most Accessible Expansion for a Good Price,"  Not only is this classic game one of my favorite deck builders (or just favorite games) of all time, but the Intrigue expansion has been my preferred expansion simply for the fact that it's a simple first-timer friendly addition of new cards that requires none of the extra bells and whistles of later expansions. Simply put, that makes this my favorite combination of game and game expansions to carry around from group of friends to group of friends.But speaking of carrying it around: it's just as big as the title implies. If you ever wanted to bring a smaller version of this game to a party, well too bad. You'll have to lug  around and scare new players away with this imposing box (see photo to compare the Big Box to the original game). That being said, for 50 dollars??? That's basically only 10 dollars more than the base game.And to address others reviews that complain about the fact that the cards are stored vertically instead of horizontally: I don't think this is a nuisance at all - in fact - I think it's better that way. For one thing, it lets you see the card titles more clearly.",5.0
5095,B01MA5AJY9,R82C7YVN2JB1S,Great Value for Base Game (updated edition) and Expansion,"  We are new to Dominion having played with our oldest son's 1st edition original game. Since we wanted to be able to play after he returned to college, and would sadly take our new favorite game back with him, we bought this combined version since we were already bored with our options with only the original set of cards.The box arrived in perfect condition, not damaged at all. All cards were included as well as the nifty organizing tray and description cards. The backs of the cards match my son's original version and have the same feel to them so I don't feel that the quality is any different with the updated edition of the base game.After playing a few other expansions, Intrigue has become a favorite so this combination of the original game (updated edition with the newer cards which I agree are better) plus Intrigue is an excellent value!",5.0
5096,B01MA5AJY9,R2994O1SKOCWXB,Awesome game!,  This is my third deck building game so I'm quite familiar with how they work. This one is also hands down my favorite.1) the game time is shorter compared to other deck building games. A game can finish in 20 to 30 minutes regularly.2) the variety of builds is fantastic. Being able to change what cards you play with every time keeps the game fresh.3) it's easier to learn and play and consistently build good decks4) expansions expansions expansions. Need I say more? :),5.0
5097,B01MA5AJY9,RYKD73Q49GVO,Great deal for a super fun game,"  I am already very familiar with this game, and have owned the first edition of the Dominion base set for many years. I purchased this set 1) have another copy of the main game when I have tournaments with friends, 2) get the  new cards only in the 2nd edition that were not available with the 1st edition (to buy those cards alone would have been $22, so this was a much better deal), & 3) get the Intrigue expansion that comes with it.This game is super fun and everyone that I‚Äôve taught (at this point almost 2 dozen people) has really enjoyed the game. I‚Äôve owned & played it for over a decade now. Don‚Äôt go overboard by trying to do too much‚Ä¶ Just start with cards from the base set at first while you‚Äôre learning the game, and then once you‚Äôre comfortable, start adding in expansion cards. I also recommend that you follow the starter game recommendation on what cards to use from the base set for your first game when you‚Äôre just learning. Enjoy!",5.0
5098,B01MA5AJY9,R1001QV03161J2,Best way to get into Dominion,"  This is a fantastic way to get into Dominion! I do wish the box was a little easier to carry around, but having both sets of cards makes for endlessly fascinating game combinations, and having played the 1st Edition for many years at friends' houses I can say that the 2nd Edition is a big improvement! If you're looking to get into this game for the first time, this is the perfect choice.",5.0
5099,B01MA5AJY9,R3RF1TD5NFKT9H,Great Game for Most,"  I knew that I would enjoy this game because I had played other similar deck builders (all app based) but I wanted to own a physical version of a deck builder and I felt that Diminion was the best. I chose to buy the big box because of the value and the added replayability. My biggest challenge was to find someone to play with. My wife enjoys some games and I was hoping to talk her into playing it at least once or twice.When I recieved the game she was immediately turned off by it because of the size and the amount of cards it had (along with the fact that it didnt look like a normal game). I finally got her to try it and she immediately grabbed onto it and wanted to play it more! We have played numerous times now and are looking to buy another expansion in the near future for more optionality.We have introduced this to a few other people who haven't played games like this and almost all of them have immediately taken to it. It is a different game than something like Trouble or Phase 10, but it is a great ""different"" game that most will enjoy!",5.0
5100,B01MA5AJY9,R17SFNIIEM2AF1,"Great value, but could use tiny improvements","  As a person absolutely engrossed with Dominion after spending a lot of time playing with other people's sets, I decided to get my own and determined this big box to be the most economical way of purchasing it. ////The major concern I have that puts my review at 3 stars is that I did not receive about a dozen cards for the randomizer deck//// (EDIT: I'm really stupid, I ended up finding them in the middle of the 6 player extra gold cards months later).Additionally, I would like to see a few things in order to aid people in setting up this edition. First, I had a bit of confusion as to why certain sections of the card stacks are divided into multiple sections (for instance, there are three separate sections in the box for copper), and how many cards go in each of those dividers. These separate dividers are obviously meant for changes from 2-4 and 5-6 people play, and it would be nice to know how many go in each to make setup and put-away easier. It would be nice to have a small booklet explaining the card distributions and initial unpacking. Additionally, the cards face vertically up instead of horizontally like in most other Dominion boxes, which I suppose is a good and bad thing. On the positive side, the cards are a lot easier to read from the box, making finding the cards you want quicker. On the negative side, it makes the cards seem a lot less secure than if they were sideways, because they protrude out of their holders much more. Perhaps a simple fix for this would be to heighten the walls between the dividers.Overall, I think that what I received was a great value, but I still wish there was some minor improvements to the box design and setup explanation",4.0
5101,B01MA5AJY9,R3E3O6M7SWC5I7,Great fun! Easily one of the best deckbuilders.,  This box contains both the base game and the Intrigue expansion. It also has a few extra cards to cover the additional players you can play.Out of the box you will need to spend probably 30 minutes sorting cards but they provide an excellent tray with inserts labelling card types.The game itself is a lot of fun in which you are ‚Äúpurchasing‚Äù buildings to increase your domain. This is the deckbuulding aspect as each card you purchase eventually ends up increasing your hand and giving you more purchase power or abilities.It is quite a bit of fun with ALOT of replayability. You use 10 card types for the ‚Äústore‚Äù each game and there are a multitude of options just in this box!,5.0
5102,B01MA5AJY9,R1ZZDHAY86SBKP,"Great game, damaged box","  Purchased the game as a replacement to a copy that was taken from me years ago. Love the game, have since i first played it 6 years ago, but the box itself came damaged while the shipping box was fine. For me this is an issue since I have a weekly group of friends come and play board games at my place and I pride myself on my collection looking good. Worth the purchase, especially when on sale.",3.0
5103,B01MA5AJY9,R1YXFBI32N2HMP,Best value for Dominion games!,"  Wow! What a great deal!! With the base set of Dominion usually starting at $44 in regular stores and Intrigue being only slightly less, the price is amazing! We love this game! My husband and I will play for hours at a time. It really is one of the few truly enjoyable games that can be played with just two people. It seems much more complicated than it is, but once you start playing it all make sense. Luckily we have played with friends before and knew what we were getting into!",5.0

Please send me 6 more duchy cards. I will update to 5 stars once this is done. Thanks.,1.0
5105,B01MA5AJY9,R17J3ES7NT31ZP,Fun and addictive.,"  This is one of my favorite games ever. It's ridiculously addictive and no two games are ever alike, and that becomes even more true if you buy more expansions. The second edition of the big box comes with extra base cards so that the game can be played with up to six players, should you have the fortune of finding those extra players. The game can seem, at first, intimidating, but it's not as difficult to learn as you may think. The cards effects are written of the card, and rules and conditions regarding each card are included in the instruction booklet. This game is easiest to learn by playing with someone who has played before, but should be easy enough to figure out by beginners. The instruction booklets also include recommended, playtested sets to get you started, although I feel half of the fun of this game comes from playing randomized sets and replacing cards and playtesting until you've created kingdoms that are fun to play. Randomize decks using the randomizer cards included, or find an app that will do it for you based on the expansions that you have; I recommend an app called Jack of All Dominion for that.",5.0
5106,B01MA5AJY9,R35RRGDHV0J4NH,"The game is great, packaging not so much","  The game itself is great - no complaints there. My main complaints are with the packaging and box. It's really big! I wish it had more compact packaging, which would make it easier to transport places and store.There's thin plastic inside the box that helps keep the cards organized - when my box arrived, this plastic had already split and broken in a couple places. After playing a few times, the plastic had cracked in a few more places. Rather low quality. This doesn't impact the game itself in any way, but are minor frustrations I encounter each time I open the box to play Dominion",4.0
5107,B01MA5AJY9,R2HZIHDNVO6S8R,Satisfying packaging,"  LOVE how satisfying this game is to put away. I opened it just so I could put it away. Everything has a spot, the spots are labeled and things don't fly all over the box even when it's tipped over.As for game play, it's super quick and easy to learn, and there are usually several different strategies to play for every different game they outline.",5.0
5108,B01MA5AJY9,R3B3371VUG4MUL,Great game and great value in big box,  I had never played this before but after seeing reviews and how many people liked I decided to get itI researched and settled on big box for two reasons. The main one was that it came with intrigue for a lower price as buying intrigue and base separately. Second it comes with enough cards to play up to 6 players instead of 4 - which I haven‚Äôt needed to do yet but wanted to have the optionSo far we have played it multiple times each game night and enjoy it a lot,5.0
5109,B01MA5AJY9,RM7DTZO9JGR4P,We love it.,"  Bought this as something the wife and I could play and keep us entertained during COVID-19.This has delivered!  We play 2-4 games when we play, and we play about 3 times a week at the moment.  We love the diversity of the game play depending on which cards are in the supply.The game is fairly simple to learn, with actual strategy coming later, which is constantly evolving based on what cards come out for that game.We are hoping to play with others this weekend, which should further increase the enjoyment and completely change the strategy of game play.",5.0
5110,B01MA5AJY9,R3E8FA55Z2UTZQ,A Great Way to Get Started for Dominion,"  I'm new to the board game hobby and heard Dominion is one of the classics, and the originator of the deck-builder genre, so I figured I had to try it out.I ordered this big box because it was only 5$ more than the base game and it came with the expansion Intrigue and extra base cards to allow for 5-6 player play; a great deal!The game is as simple as your ABCs. Every player's turn is just : 1 Action, 1 Buy, then Cleanup. You use treasure to buy new cards from the middle shared supply to add to your deck, and at the end of the game, the winner is whoever has the most victory points in their deck. It sounds (and is) super simple to pick up and play, which was super important to me, because I've had to teach it to many friends / family members. The rules are simple, but figuring out the best strategy? Not so much. I have so much fun playing this game and trying to figure out what is the most effective strategy with the cards on the table. And what's even cooler, is that no game will play the same, because you pick 10 kingdom piles to play with out of the 52 (26 from base game, 26 from intrigue) leading to an ever changing modular experience.I've played Magic the Gathering for years, so I expected to like this game because card games and deckbuilding is something I enjoy, however I didn't expect my girlfriend to enjoy it so much as well! The day after the game arrived we tried playing our first games together and ended up playing for 3 hours straight without even realizing! This game is a ton of fun and a staple of the board gaming hobby. Dominion deserves a spot on everyone's shelf!The only downsides I can think of are :- With constant shuffling, cards may get damaged over time (and if sleeved, cards will no longer fit into their organized places in the box)- The box is big (as said in the title) and fairly heavy. I bring it to my friend's houses but you will need both arms to carry!- And finally, the game isn't anything to look at. The cards themselves have pretty dull art and the art style / art direction is a little dated. Going from Mysterium (a solid game with GORGEOUS ART) to this with my family was a bit of a shock. So if pretty pictures is really important to you for enjoying your board games, take that into consideration. Take a look at some of the card art online and judge for yourselfOverall, this game is phenomenal, and its surface simplicity paired with potential depth lends itself to players of all degrees of gaming ability. I 100% recommend, what are you waiting for? Get Dominion! Play games with friends and family!",5.0
5111,B01MA5AJY9,RFI1CNB4NYHQ1,Dominion is just awesome.,"  I bought this game in anticipation that the cards would be the same as my Dominion First Edition. This is not the case, as has been mentioned. The cards feel flimsy.However, this is still an awesome game, and the extra players it can support due to extra money and territories make this an amazing buy that lets different games of Dominion happen, which games would not happen without the extra cards.So, 1 star ding for bad cardstock, 4 stars anti-ding for Rio Grande being awesome.",4.0
5112,B01MA5AJY9,R16ZDCOBUR23GU,"This is a great, variable card game","  This is a great, variable card game. I enjoy it best with two players, but it works with more, especially with this set, which has cards for up to six. This is one of the original deckbuilders, and it has a great ecosystem of worthwhile expansions, but the original, and, in this set the included Intrigue expansion is considered the minimum to play a complex game full of strategy and newness.If you like card games, or board games, you will like this game.",5.0
5113,B01MA5AJY9,R35847G3PSAABR,Really large box,"  I love dominion, the game is great and versatile because it changed every time. My minor complaint would be with the packaging. Because this is a double game, the box is really very large and because the cards are all in slots you can‚Äôt put it on it‚Äôs side. Your kinda stuck with a huge box that is deeper than a standard shelf. Two boxes would have been better.",4.0
5114,B01MA5AJY9,R3EVRPNUO2NVDQ,Every game is unique and engaging,"  This is one of the best games I have played and owned. The learning curve feels a bit steep for the first game.

Lots of action cards to choose from and various cards create very interesting combinations, making for lasting memories. I will be buying all the extension packs, one at a time.",5.0

I got these to update to the second editions of both base and Intrigue and couldn't be happier.  If you plan to travel with this box, make sure to put a thin layer of soft padding inside your top lid to keep all the cards in place in transit.  Yes, I did learn this the hard way.  That is a LOT of cards in one box.  And when they are all mixed up it takes a long time to sort them all back out.",5.0
5116,B01MA5AJY9,R1218XV826TUTI,The ultimate deckbuilder game!,"  An extremely fun game, easy to pick up and a lot of variety with the cards. The only knock would be the theme (it's rather bland), however, as a deck builder game this is the benchmark.You can pick the cards for the game, allowing it to be as complex or simple as you'd like. You can also choose to enhance interaction between the players by selecting the correct cards.",5.0
5117,B01MA5AJY9,R3O10Y2UY2G3AG,Loving this game,"  I have played this before with some of my friends and loved it. Once COVID hit, we wanted to get one as we are completely at home. It's a great addition to your collection if you like board games. I bought the extension pack so we could play with some friends and it just cost $15 more. There are several online explanations on the game but I suggest you play a couple of games to get used to it. Its not a long game and can be completed it about 1 hour for a group of 4-6. I really like the game and would definitely recommend it as a gift.",5.0
5118,B01MA5AJY9,R6XO4DMGJLBA3,Count Your Cards,"  This is more a critique of Amazon and Rio Grande than the game itself. Be sure to check your packaging and count your cards! After seeing several reviews on here stating similarly, I counted mine when it came and I was shorted by a pack that included Harem, Duke, Mill, and Nobles (they were all missing). Amazon Returns are easy enough, and so is contacting Rio Grande for replacement cards, but should that really be necessary? Great game, great set-up/layout with the box. Just seems like maybe this game got a little too popular too fast and they couldn't keep up.",3.0
5119,B01MA5AJY9,RC6CTRWK1EHPG,Amazing game - less than amazing packaging,"  This is my favorite game in the universe, and so this review doesn't reflect the quality of the game.  Purchased this as a gift for my son who is stranded weathering a lockdown order, and had it shipped directly to him.  The shipping box was damaged, which resulted in damage to the box that holds these cards, including the plastic inner case that holds the individual cards in place.  Because he's on lockdown, he's playing the game and has no way to process the return.  Annoyed to have paid full-price for a damaged product.",2.0
5120,B07HB88VXG,R2FJI3D48MRBOO,NOTE - THIS VERSION IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPANSION!!!,"  Fun game! A little complex to get started, but good randomness and easy to pick up once you've played a few times.After I read a few reviews, I bought both the base version and the expansion, but the expansion (Supercup) is not compatible with this version. You have to buy the Pegasus versions of BOTH (colors are difference, dice are difference sized).  So, despite 5*, I would recommend not buying this and getting the more expensive version if you think you might play regularly with a larger group.",5.0
5121,B07HB88VXG,R3S1NOUYSDY72R,NEWER VERSION AND BETTER GAME PEICES,  This is really lots of fun.  There are two versions of this game. This is the newer version which doesn't work with the expansion of the older version. This newer version does have some of the expansions included along with the crazy camels that go backward. Which also was a limited expansion for the old version that is hard to find.  The game peices are great quality. Especially the pyramid that rolls the dice which is made plastic.  The older version is cardboard with rubber bands which is not all that great. The game is fun and quick once you get the hang of it.,5.0
5122,B07HB88VXG,R1K8TWOAUMUYYM,"Greaty Party/Family Game, Full of Laughter and Standout Moments","  GAME COMPONENTSThe game has stunning art-work. With Beautiful pop-up tree that stands out. The egyptian theme comes out nicely by the pop-up palm trees, the great dice roll pyramid and ofcourse the camels! The component quality is good/premium. The camels stack nicely on top of each others. The pyramid dice roll is amazing. The card quality for betting is okay. And the coins are good as they're made of plastic (and not cardbaoard), but still size could have been little bigger.GAMEPLAYGame is very simple to teach. You have 5 colored dice to control which camels moves by how many steps. There is one dice to control two crazy camels which run backwards. If a camel lands on top of another crazy camel, it could move backwards along with crazy camels!The game is highly luck-based and is supposed to be some fun time with friends and family, where you just sit back, sip on beers and watch those crazy camels run every which way! One could say that people with good maths and probability calculation would do well in the game by predicting what color die are left in the pyramid, and what outcomes are possible, but that's just as far as it goes. The dice rolls are random, player actions could change that with +1, -1 tiles, the crazy camels could disrupt your planning and bunch of other factors!Every game we played was unique and full of laughs. The excitement of rolling a die as to what would fall out of the pyramid and then waiting to see what face would be at the top (1/2/3). It just adds to the excitment. There would be games where one camel would come out of the blocks running ahead of everybody else, just to end of on top of a crazy camel which takes it backwards!The game is silly. And every time we played it with friends, they were thoroughly entertained. The repeated plays, one after the other could get somewhat boring though.CONCLUSIONThis is great game for parties and holiday gaming with friends and family. It's quick to setup, easy to teach and fun to play. I've played it with varying group sizes of 3-8 people and every time it was super-fun with standout moments. The game has great table presence and appeals to the audience of all types/groups.I highly recommend it for your collection.",5.0

Just buy this nicer, newer, better version and have a lot more fun with extra money in your pocket. The game was easy to teach and even my 7-year-old picked up on the majority of the gameplay (she missed some of the strategies, but still had fun and did well). There is a good mix of strategy and luck and some crazy fun changes with the ""crazy camels"". This version is better than the original, even when you add the super cup expansion to the original.

As a long time board-gamer, I dismissed it as fluff...boy was I wrong. It's amazingly easy to teach/learn, plays quickly, but has enough depth of decisions to make even the most hardcore gamer find enjoyment. As a quick 20-30 minutes, this is the perfect book-end for a more serious ""game night"" whether you're waiting for people to arrive, or finished a meatier game with some time to kill afterwards. It's just a really tightly done game that gets better at higher player counts. It's not a big game and can therefore setup and tear down in minutes. It definitely fills a niche in my collection, and for the price, it's a worthy purchase for long-time gamers or people just looking for something casual to play with the family.",5.0
5125,B07HB88VXG,RXU5FF5Q78ZC7,Great stand-up excitement,"  Excellent family game.  It has the fun of racing games, the drama of betting, and the perfect balance of unpredictability to keep it interesting.  There are great logical decisions to be made, but there is the right amount of luck to keep the game light and fun.  This is a game with strategy that also has laughs.  It is also a good game to introduce people to board games as the rules are simple.  The game takes about 35 minutes.  My kids (7, 9, 11) love it and it still is interesting to play with only adults.  The components are high quality.  I wish the betting ticket values were bigger and more dramatically different.  The pyramid is great an adds a lot to the drama, wondering what color will come out.

Here ""A man plans his ways but..."" those goofy camels can throw those plans out of the window.I have played with people ranging from 14-65, all of whom have enjoyed it, even if never really liking their (often limited) idea of boardgames.We have enjoyed it with player counts of as high as 8, down to a 1v1, each being fun as it is the camels that are racing, rather than us guiding one (to any great effect, at least).Most all players want to ""play again!"" and a few have gone straight to the 'interwebs' to buy it for themselves.Fully recommended by me.  :-)",5.0

We had the original version which we love, this is the new version and it has a plastic pyramid (more durable), additional camels for more players, and includes 2 camels that go backward to add a plot twist unexpectedly during the game.  This version also allows for some collaboration between players when you are playing with more than 4.  It's as much luck as it is strategy but it is super fun and fairly quick to play, taking around a half hour or so.  The board and pieces are well made.  It's more expensive than many board games, but also very different from any other board game I've played and if you enjoy board games it's worth it.",5.0

I believe my daughter has introduced it to her 7 year olds now, too. There is strategy, but that can be blown away by some of the random features, so that those with lesser skills can sometimes come out on top thanks to a couple of neurotic camels headed in the wrong direction.",5.0
5129,B07HB88VXG,R3R4J62H3K320O,Great 2nd Edition,"  So I owned the first edition, this is the second edition and I really like it: the pyramid and box are a real improvement.For starters, the game is fun. The dice make it random enough there really is not a great strategy. You just sit back and enjoy the game. A very light game. Not for hardcore Gamers looking for a true racing game.The new dice pyramid is much better on this edition.The box insert is well done and stores all the parts nicely (very tidy).The plastic camels  are not a problem (not cheap looking).I love the game's artwork.",5.0
5130,B07HB88VXG,R3OI2UM9B4789R,Very fun and replayable,"  The original game won the prestigious game of the year award and this follow-up version apparently fixes a few minor problems.  The fold-out oasis themed board is lavish and playable.  The plastic pyramid works great for dispensing the dice during each round.  Including the ""crazy camels"" (formerly a separate expansion) in the base game is great because these make the outcome of each race less predictable.  A great buy to add a fun but not too serious game to your arsenal",5.0
5131,B07HB88VXG,RKRYM3ZO06AVR,Family fun at the camel races!!,"  We play a lot of games, and I like to have variety. I can tell you that you more than likely do not have a game like Camel Up. This is a family friendly betting game that can be played with both kids and adults. Each turn comes down to 5 simple choices, with one of those choices being to roll a die out of the really cool plastic pyramid, which guarantees you a point. This game is going to be hitting my table a lot thanks to the charming artwork, the astounding components, and the super cook pop-up board (why don‚Äôt more games do this???)If you have kids in the 7-12 age range, you really can‚Äôt go wrong with this game.",5.0
5132,B07HB88VXG,R23T4A5ZUJV46T,Fun game!,  I like this game. Played it 4-5 times with my friends and won every time. I ended up buying for myself. Started to teach my family it and they kicked my butt every time. Still a fun game. Easy to learn. Annoying sometimes when the unthinkable happens but does make the game great. My sister always bets on the yellow camel...and one time by a stroke of amazing rolls that happened to launch yellow into first. The whole time were joking that yellow could do it and does. Easy to play and drink too.,5.0
5133,B07HB88VXG,RB5GUXB7HT7VU,Great family fun!,"  We got this game to play with our young kids (11,9,4) and it's a hit.

Also, the board and game pieces are very beautifully designed.",5.0
5134,B07HB88VXG,R2YED2DWZUDHAI,Addicting!,"  Camel Up is a board game based on risk and probability, but the new ""crazy camels"" add an element of complete chance that even the geekiest cannot estimate.

5135,B07HB88VXG,R62G5FND6F52F,Fun in a box!,"  The only way I can describe this game is fun! If you‚Äôre looking for a serious, strategy-rich game then this isn‚Äôt for you, but if you want a light, fun game that always involves laughter and ‚Äúoh no‚Äù moments this is the one!The overall design is well developed and one of the better game box designs for storing components (not a selling factor but this is becoming a more appreciative feature compared to many more expensive games).Camel Up is also great for a wide range of age groups - we play with my two older kids (10+) and parents/siblings and everyone is able to enjoy it for several plays with a consistent experience. Great for light, social plays and one you should definitely check out for your collection!",5.0
5136,B07HB88VXG,R3SY1REBM93KSQ,Really like the game.,"  I really like this game. It's easy to learn and works well with a group.

So now the lid does not stay on tight and you have to hold it on while rolling.",4.0

5141,B07HB88VXG,RW8WYIDU6UFB5,LOVE,"  I had played the older version of this game before and I love it so I gift this one to my Mom. She absolutely loves it!!I get her a game at least once a year because she loves to play when family is visiting but I have never seen her so excited about one. After teaching her how to play, she told me the next week that they had two different groups of friends over to play. Such a fun game for adults who get bored with traditional party games.",5.0

The white and black camels can move your camel back making the results unpredictable.  Other twists and turns make this a truly fun game.  The pyramid dice holder is clever.",5.0
5144,B07HB88VXG,R1KN82I87PQA5H,Great for game night.,"  Super fun game. The board is really cool. If you like probability games, this one is fun.

5150,B0002HYHT6,RW2HFSX1DA5ZN,A quality young children's board game,"  This is a fun board game to play with your 3 to 6 year old children that will exercise their mind a little as well. Older siblings and parents in the family will enjoy playing the game with them.Players roll 6 dice with faces of different colors. They use these colors to move forward on the colored race track. The track has three lanes with colored spaces on them. Players have to figure out how to use their 6 dice colors to move ahead on the track, switching lanes back and forth as needed. The track has spaces with wrecked tires on them which have to navigated around along the way. Players can land on each other's cars and push them back a space. There are tire wreck spaces on the track which need to be navigated around. The first person across the finish line might be the winner. I say ""might"" because the rules say that each of the other players get one more roll after the first player to cross the finish line. If another player can cross the finish line with less moves than the first person used then they can win instead.Both my children, 5 and 8, enjoy playing this game together. I enjoy playing it with them as well.The pieces are nice and sturdy wooden race cars and dice. The pieces will definitely stand up to classroom use. The board is nice thick cardboard. The game is very colorful, attractive, and cute. As you can see in the video, the whole game is smaller than board games usually are. This is very nice because it takes up less space on a shelf.This is a great game to practice colors with young children. Figuring out which order to use the rolled dice takes a nice amount of forward thinking strategy on the part of the children as well. If they choose a less than optimal order they won't move as far. It is a much superior color matching game to the old standard Candy Land due to the fact that Candy Land has no strategic thought in its gameplay. I'd definitely recommend this game to my fellow educators and parents over that one .",5.0
5151,B0002HYHT6,R2MQ7S6RLEZF78,Your Kids Can Grow With This!,"  This is an excellent and sought after game for young children and great fun for the adults playing it with them.  Don't let the recommended age fool, you.  Kids can start playing this as soon as they recognize their colors.  If they can play Candy Land, they can play this.  The difference is, with this game they will continue to learn rather than get bored, because there are actual decisions to be made in this game.  Our 3.5 year old twins love this game.  It's one of their top three picks.  They still don't fully understand the strategy and tactics, but this game is helping them to learn skills like planning ahead and examining different options.  It also helps them learn to deal with frustration when the dice don't always go their way, while allowing them to make the most of what they do get.The race track consists of three lanes of different colored squares.  In addition, there are spaces you can't enter because there is ""debris"".  Your turn consists of rolling six dice, each with the six colors of the race track squares on them.  You then use the colors you rolled for your movement.  If there is a blue space in front of you, you can utilize a blue that you rolled to move forward.  No blue?  No problem, just change lanes to the green space next to you.  By looking at your options, your goal is to use all six dice if possible to move as far as you can around the track.When first playing, kids can focus on learning their colors and making the connection between the spaces they can move to and the colors that they rolled.  As they progress, they learn to consider multiple possibilities (i.e.  If I use my green to move to that space, I won't be able to go farther because I would need a blue.  However, I use a white to change to this lane, I can move four more spaces with the colors I have!)",5.0
5152,B0002HYHT6,R1ITOBDTM57V70,"Gameplay is 5 stars, the rest is 4, maybe 3","  This is a great intro strategy game. It is simple, but fun.  Roll the dice, use all six colors to advance your card the farthest and provide yourself the best options in future rolls (often you can take multiple different routes, and so it teaches planning), and finish first to win!The cars are well made wooden pieces, but small, the dice are nice and made of wood, but the board screams cheap.  For 25 dollars, I expected more.  The board is the same material I have seen used in 5 dollar games and is a massive letdown as it should be more in the 15 dollar range.  I would say the game value isn't there, if it wasn't so fun to play.  Even with the cheapness factored in, I am still glad I bought it because it has a lot of replay value.",4.0
5153,B0002HYHT6,R2Z00ULZQSLMB6,My favorite first board game for young kids!,"  I bought this game to play with my 4 year old soon to be 5 and seeing if I could introduce my 3 year old to it as well...My 3 year old might not be ready yet :) He is too much of and walking tornado still...With my 4-5 year old this game has been great, it teaches her patience, turns and the basics of board gaming.  Apart from that this game has mathematical logic in its foundation.  If you do follow the full thought process of determining the optimal colors to pick on your path for each play it really teaches a young mind logical thinking, space analysis and observation.  This is why I love it the most.  This was initially difficult for my kid to comprehend, but she is getting the hold of path testing before making her move and organizing her color dice strategically to see which ones to use first in a play with the intention of gaining more distance or even taking a spot.. its great.. lots of elements for kids to learn from! and its just a beautifully done game.  Great first board game to share with your kids!",5.0
5154,B0002HYHT6,RGA0DXXO2YXHZ,Great Game for Young and Old.,"  I've been a serious board gamer since the 80's and belong to several board game clubs in my area. I've been looking for a game that my friends and I could play with my young son that wasn't the typical ""Chutes & Ladders"" or ""Candy Land"" and saw this game at my local board game store. As a serious board gamer I'm well aware of the quality of games coming from Europe so I wasn't too reluctant to buy this; especially at this price. All in all it's a great game that everyone of all ages can enjoy. The only issue I have is that I'd like for the game board and pieces to be a little bigger because I think it would be easier for small hands to use. I also think that making the game board larger would allow younger player to grasp the mechanics and strategies a little easier.",4.0
5155,B0002HYHT6,RZA7UV4C5TG22,Awesome little racing game for ages 4-8!,"  This is a great next step after ""Hit the Throttle!"" (also by Haba games).  It adds a little strategic decision making (do I go red, blue, white - or yellow, white, blue?).  I've played this game many times with my kids (ages 4-8), and they enjoy it every time.  The game does lose its entertainment value around age 8 though, where he wants more of a challenge.The luck of the dice is usually fair, but sometimes it's amazing what can happen.  There have been games where we're neck and neck the whole race, and other games where one of us crosses the finish line while the other player is still at the first turn.  There have been yet other games where one of us BLASTS out of the starting line and shoots half way around the track, but then stalls out there the rest of the game while everybody else finishes.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it demonstrates how this is 90% a chance game...  You can combat that slightly by allowing players to re-roll once on their turn.",5.0
5156,B0002HYHT6,RYVCC2WT00S4I,Mom and three year old enjoy,"  I bought this for my 6 and 8 year old sons, they do enjoy playing, but not as much as my three year old daughter (she doesn't get as concerned if she loses).  She loves rolling the dice and driving her car. I do have to prompt her at times(""you got a green and a red, you can use green and then red"")but some rolls she does navigate herself.  My eight year old removed Monza from the family games and put it in his own private toy stash. I took this as proof that he places a higher value on Monza than our other games.There are tricky spots on the track where every player will have trouble navigating.  This helps alleviate any pouting.  The children realize it's hard for everyone- not just them (if you've got that kind of kid).The cars, die, and board are very nicely made and really cute.  As an adult, I much prefer this game to everything else we have for young children; Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, Hi-Ho Cherry-O, trouble, and card drawing games.",5.0
5157,B0002HYHT6,R3VMBB1YLY4Q0T,Colorful Racing Fun,"  This is another one of those games where the colorful graphics excited the kids enough to draw our attention to it. After reading the description and the reviews, it looked like a worthy investment.To my surprise, my daughter loves it as much as the boys do! Your moves change with the roll of the dice, and you always have options so there is strategy involved, but it is so simple to learn, kids and adults will enjoy every minute of it. You can look like you're off to a fast start and then get stuck needing a specific color to get past road hazards... or you can suddenly pull well ahead from way behind by creatively being able to use all 6 colors in a lucky toss.This has quickly become a family favorite. It is elegant simplicity, a fun design, the kids love it, we love it.It is small and portable, can be played in small spaces too, making it great for a quick game before bed. Kids learn while having fun. The board is sturdy and thick, the small wooden cars seem fairly durable, and they were kind to include 6 so more people can play. My daughter especially loves the purple car and the white car. The theme is adorable, the concept is enjoyable and once you try it, your family will want to play it over and over again too. Love this!",5.0

5161,B0002HYHT6,R8KQIBKO9OS1B,Enjoyable Children's Racing Game,"  I purchased Monza as a boardgame to play with my 6 year old that wasn't Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, etc. It is simple to learn and requires more thinking than the traditional role and move children's games. My son thoroughly enjoys playing it. He keeps on bringing it out and requests to play it with me. As is the HABA standard, the production quality is excellent with wooden pieces and a sturdy playing board that will stand up to repeated play. Game is not perfect (ok, it is a kids game I don't expect awesome perfection). It is heavily luck dependent (but what kids game of this type isn't) rolling six dice and there are a few spots on the board where you can only move forward if you roll one color. If you don't roll the needed color you're stuck. Once is annoying. A couple of turns in a row and it gets a bit aggravating. But, it is nowhere near as fun killing as in Sorry! or Aggravation where you can go turn after turn after turn unsuccessfully drawing cards or rolling dice needed to move a piece into play. Overall I am very happy with Monza and recommend it as a race themed children's game.I purchased my copy from River Runners (Amazon Marketplace) and am very happy with them. Good price, Prime eligible, fast service/delivery.",5.0

Monza is one of my 4-year old son's favorite Haba games to play; the other game he loves is ""Animal Upon Animal.""  The quality of the pieces are high.  The strategy level is high enough that I don't get bored, and is good enough for my son.  After a couple of games, he got the strategy and plans his moves accordingly.  I would recommend Monza if you are sick of playing games like Chutes and Ladders, and Candyland, where this no real brain activity involved.  It plays in about 15 minutes.",5.0

He was quick to pick up the concept, however I think the way the spaces line up could have been more clear, sometimes it was difficult for him to discern which space was ahead.

5178,B0002HYHT6,RAHRT7I0ASSF5,Fun racing game that also teaches strategy... limited by the board,"  I generally like racing games, so I was excited to get this to play with my kids.HABA's components, per usual, are excellent. With one of the central mechanisms being rolling a ton of dice, kids enjoy it. And since you move by the color on the die, you can actually have a modicum of strategy AND teachable moments with kids as they riddle out how many dice they can use. Frankly, I think there's a good secondary lesson in that they learn they can't always use _all_ the dice every turn and some turns they can only use one or no dice.The problem comes in the fact that there's just one board, so re-playability will become an issue if you enjoy it. I wish HABA had come up with a double-sided board to extend the re-playability and add some variety (not unlike Formula De/D boards). Also, this one board does have a color-limited bottleneck about halfway through -- and it was very clearly designed to be that way, While I don't mind some patches of the board being a bit more difficult, cars frequently get stalled there for several turns -- and it can really dampen a kid's enthusiasm. In my mind, that's avoidable. Still, it does hit the table and we combat this defect by having the cars race in teams.",4.0

I initially opened the box, and saw a bunch of low-detail little meeple-like wooden pieces, which I was not expecting in a reprint (I was thinking there would be plastic figures).  Yes, all the monsters/creatures, and boats are wooden cutouts.  The ""treasure hunters"" are plastic meeples, with numbers etched into their bottom surface.  The tiles for the island are nice quality cardboard pieces of three different thicknesses, with stickers to denote that they represent mountains, forests, and desert/beach (each location is a certain thickness, too).The gameplay is similar to forbidden island, in that it is easy to understand, easy to teach, and feels like you are trying to escape an island. The major difference, is that in Survive, you are trying to get all of your meeples to safety, while trying to stop the other players from doing so, before the volcano blows, all the while, people are pulling tiles, and making the island sink (not to mention, each tile has a picture on the bottom of it, that will either immediately spawn a boat/creature, or can be used later).  Players can mess with each other by moving the monsters/creatures on the board to create havoc with other players meeples, stealing/joining their boats, and playing tiles that allow you to turn the game in your favor.  Finally, you roll the monster die, and get to move a creature to try to mess with another player.I have played about 5 times, and it has not gotten less tense.  There is just enough ""take that"", and strategy, to keep it interesting every time, and it still feels like I am in control enough to have a chance to win.  Overall, it is a good game that has timeless appeal just the way it is.",5.0
5181,B0084M8UE4,R2FJ2BCF6R585V,Fun quick learned board game for kids 7-8 to adults can you survive the sinking Atlantis??,"  Bought for my son's 14 bday- to give his xbox a rest... We love board games- real ones like ticket to ride, settlers of catan, camel up ( which I reviewed previously) to name a few. So I saw this in a book a million but hubs had me buy Takenoko the panda game instead-- when sons bday came around, we got this game- just the basic 2/4 player set. Sturdy board and solid wood pieces and solid plastic people- not cheap plastic! Game play is a quick learn (7 yr old picked up on it quickly)- basically there's an island with sand, forests and mountains and it's sinking and your people need to get to dry land in one do the four corners. Sand, forest and mountain tile placement is random so it's different every game. Then you rotate placing people on the sand, forest and mountain tiles..then you place 2 boats per player in the sea to use to transport your people to dry land. The sand tiles disappear first, then forest and mountain..one of those has a volcano which ends the game immediately. Plus what fun would it be without a few sea monsters, sharks and whales to eat others people and knock them off their boats. People have various numbers 1-6 on the bottom of them, you score only those that make it to land before the volcano erupts- the rest are all lost at sea. Once you get the basics. You can work on strategy- I even had a guy swim to shore because I had two dolphin help swimmer tiles. We are going to get expansions for Christmas- a nice fun somewhat fast game that isn't too complicated for little kids (7-8) but has enough strategy to keep adults engaged and it's fun to kick your kids people out I the boat and eat them....let's be honest here!!",5.0
5182,B0084M8UE4,R1B06S0TTVJ38J,Purple Phoenix Games Review,"  I have never been on a sinking anything. Sure, I have flipped over kayaks, and paddle-boards, and anything else that requires me to balance on top of water. But I cannot imagine the terror of being on an island that just‚Ä¶ sinks into the deep. Oh also running out of room and having to swim to safe land. Oh also while sharks, whales, and sea monsters are chasing me. You know what? Maybe I‚Äôm cool with being located in the Midwest. I‚Äôll just play this game and live vicariously through the esceeples (escaping meeples? I need a handbook for these -eeple terms).Survive: Escape from Atlantis! (which I now will call Survive) is an competitive adventure game featuring action points, grid movement, secret unit deployment, dice rolls, and lots of take-that. And little boats. It also can destroy friendships and ruin evenings. Play at your own risk.DISCLAIMER: There are several expansions to this game, but we are not reviewing them at this time. We ARE including the 5-6 player mini expansion, however. Should we review the others in the future we will either update this review or post a link to the new material here. Also, I do not intend to detail every rule in the book, but give our readers an idea of how the game plays and our thoughts on it. -TTo setup a game of Survive, each player will choose a color and take into their supply all the meeples of that color and two boats. Place all the terrain tiles randomly (and face down) within the bolded line on the board to create the central island. Place out the sea serpents on the sea serpent spots as menacingly as possible. Players then take turns placing their numbered meeples on terrain tiles until all meeples have been placed, and their boateeples on any water space near the island they wish. Keep aside the shark, whale, and dolphin meeples for later. Give the die to the first player and you are ready to play.On a player‚Äôs turn they will 1. Play any tiles from their hand, 2. Move meeples, 3. Remove terrain a tile, 4. Roll the die and move creatures. At the beginning of the game nobody will have any tiles in hand to play, so skip this step if there are no tiles in hand. On subsequent turns players may have collected tiles as a result of the #3 action, and now is the time to play those. Typically they are beneficial for the active player or detrimental to the opponents. Next, the active player will move their meeples in any combination three total board hexes. This can be done with one or more meeples on land or in the water. There are movement restrictions that I will not cover here. After movement, the active player will remove one of the terrain tiles with the lowest elevation (sand, forest, then mountain tiles). The player flips over the tile and will play it immediately if it shows an arrow, or keeps it in hand if it shows a hand icon. Finally, the active player will roll the red die and move creatures per the movement table printed on the board.Creature movement creates the tension in the game (as if fighting over the boats wasn‚Äôt enough). You see, when sharks enter the board and are moved, they are hungry for swimmer meeples (obv). Whales are hungry(?) for boats and will destroy them but fling the meeples aboard into the water to become swimmers. Sea serpents don‚Äôt care. They will eat swimmers and manned boats‚Ä¶ but they‚Äôre the slowest movers. So consider that.Play continues in this fashion until the either all meeples have been removed from the play grid, or a player flips over the volcano mountain tile and ends the game. Any meeples who have made it to the safety of the outer islands are worth the VP printed on their bottoms. Wait, not the butts. The bottom of the meeples. Which I guess are the feet.Components. To reiterate, in case it was missed, we are reviewing the 2010 Stronghold edition. There is a newer version, and it seems to look a little better but plays the same. However, I love the components of this version too. The meeples are fine, the creatures are cool, the varying thicknesses of the terrain tiles makes for an interesting mini-3D look, and the board is great without being too busy and distracting. I have absolutely no issues with these components and think they are super.Now, you may have read in my intro that this game may ruin friendships and the evening, and I really am not joking about this. I have played this so many times where at least one person becomes completely angered by the chomping of the shark or the horrible movement of the sea serpent adjacent to their boat. It‚Äôs just a game, and it‚Äôs inevitable in this one ‚Äì your meeples will get eaten. It‚Äôs gonna happen! When I teach this now I try to make that apparent right away because it is then not viewed as absolutely treachery when it happens to newer players. Should you be playing with sensitive gamers, please instruct them early that it WILL happen or you‚Äôre gonna have a bad time.However, this game is great! I love it now as much as I ever have. It‚Äôs an older horse for me, but one of which I will never tire. I can and love to play it with new gamers, especially the ones that are hoping to join the inner circle. If you can hang through a game of Survive without being angered and taking it all in stride, you are welcome at my table ANY time. That said, as you can see by our ratings, Purple Phoenix Games gives this one a mighty and well-deserved 21 / 24. If you enjoy games that upset your players and want a cool theme on it, check out Survive: Escape from Atlantis!",4.0
5183,B0084M8UE4,R33ZQ5023KVH3M,Pretty fun game for the family,"  Due to the whole COVID thing we‚Äôve gotten in to board games again and needed an addition. We don‚Äôt like long, intense strategy games that take forever to play and have 1000 rules,etc. this was a perfect game. Easy-ish to learn for our young (early teens) kids and has some competitiveness to it as well.As others have stated, the gist of the game is is remove a tile from the board (beaches first, then forest, then mountain), move your Meeple or boat three spaces and then roll the die in order to move either a shark,whale or sea monster around the board. Your goal is to get your Meeple to shore to earn points.The board, Meeple and creatures are well constructed. The game is fun and relatively easy to pick up. The only reason I didn‚Äôt give it a full 5 stars is because several of the moves you make with Meeples are not clearly explained in the rules and we kind of did a ‚Äúmake-it-up-as-you-go‚Äù kind of thing until we scanned the Internet for actual, correct explanations to our specific questions. Now that we have that down it‚Äôs more enjoyable as we don‚Äôt sit there and stare any longer several times a game wondering if we played a move correctly or not.Each gam usually takes about 40 minutes with three people, a bit longer with four. And believe it or not there IS some strategy involved. We probably play this 5 nights a week. If you don‚Äôt like marathon-session games but still have to think a little this is a great game.",4.0
5184,B0084M8UE4,R3EX93P5ELPNVK,"Use sea monsters to wreck your friends' meeples, but hopefully not your friendships","  What a fun game! I really enjoy this one. It has a similar feel to Forbidden Island for the island sinking portion alone. However! This is not a co-op game, and you aren't searching for treasure. This is a down and dirty survival game while trying to screw over your friends. I love it. It gets vicious with people trying to steal their friends' boats or sink them with sea monsters. You can even eat your friends' meeples with sharks! It is easy to teach and set up. I feel like this is a great game you can play with people who are not avid gamers, and they will still enjoy it. It isn't overly complicated and the game play isn't so long that it gets boring for people who aren't into heavier games.However, I am a big gamer and don't feel like this game is lacking in any way. It's got a strong theme and enough meat in the strategy department to keep it interesting. A good choice for a 4 player game with family or friends.",5.0
5185,B0084M8UE4,R1J0TFWCRNGJL0,Great casual game with a good variety of gameplay,"  This is our current favorite game! I like games where you feel that your strategy effects the outcome of the game. It's also good for a game to have some luck so that people of different levels can play and the outcome won't only be decided by strategy. I also like that a lot of the ""luck"" is actually other player choices. There is very little cooperative gameplay and there's no trading/collecting. It's all about getting the most of your men safe from a sinking Atlantis!The game in a nutshell is one where you save your people, and depending on which people you save will give you a total score that you try to beat everyone else's total score. You can play with two people, but it's really a 3-4 player game (5-6 expansion available but I've not tried it). The goal is to escape a sinking island across the sea to the other islands at the 4 corners of the board. Every turn you get three movements to try and get some of your 10 people to safety. Also every turn you remove one of 40 land tiles. First you remove the sand, then the forest, and then the rock tiles. One of the 8 rock tiles has the volcano which ends the game. Once the game ends, everyone on Atlantis or in the ocean dies and you count up your tiles. Oh, and beware, there are whales, sea creatures and sharks in the water!Pros:-There's variety in the gameplay. Every turn you have up to five things to do and there is a different starting gameplay. You may be able to use a tile from previous gameplay, you get to move your people, you get to take a land tile from the board, you may be able to use that tile immediately, and finally you get to roll a die which lets you move a monster. For as simple a game as it is, there is some real variety in what you're doing! And there's not a single mechanic I dislike.-You can surprise yourself! Each of your people has a different point value from 1-6 on their feet. You only look at the feet at the beginning of the game. If you don't keep track of where what point value is, you may have to wait to the end of the game to see what your score is! Nobody other than you knows the point values at all, so they have no idea how many points they need to beat you! Don't tell my wife, but I turn the biggest point value sideways...-The end of the game has some randomness. Everybody knows the volcano end game tile is somewhere in the rocky ground. But it could be the first rock turned or it could be the last! That add some tension when you get to the rock tiles, and knowing there is an end coming keeps you from playing too defensive of a game.Cons:-It's possible to know you will lose halfway into the game and have to keep playing. You could lose your highest scoring people or even lose all of your people. Then you are supposed to keep playing till the end.-There are a lot of mechanics that encourage revenge play. The players could all gang up against someone too. You can certainly play fair, but there's no mechanic to discourage these tactics.-There are green tiles you can play immediately and red tiles you play your next turn. If you look carefully at the edge of the face down land tiles you can tell whether you're grabbing a green or red tile. I wish the very edge of the bottom of every tile was black so you couldn't tell them apart.We love this game! The adults have played it regularly and the 8 year old son picked up immediately. I'm not sure if the six year old daughter gets it, but I didn't really expect her to. If you like Catan or other casual games, I really suggest this! After you learn how to play it only takes 30-45 minutes. In fact I've not had the game end yet where people didn't want to play a second time!",5.0

BUY THIS, and you'll immediately but the 3-in-1 expansion. It's that fun.Also consider Splendor, a totally different game that takes 30 seconds to learn and plays fast - yet with lots of replayability.The games allows you to take 3 actions it turn plus a dice roll to control the ""shared"" creatures that anyone can move to eat, sink, or save the players.",5.0
5187,B0084M8UE4,R11R64YKABAITZ,A few things I disliked about this version,"  I got the original game as a gift when I was a child. (We still have it). My brothers and I played it all the time. So, this game has a lot of sentimentality attached to it. A few things I disliked about this version... The island pieces are made of pressed cardboard, I dread the first time anything remotely wet comes into contact with them (the original pieces are as well, but once you see the new much thicker pieces it is easier to understand), and some of the new playing rules are a bit annoying to me. However, those are easily ignored. I liked the larger more colorful (yet darker) board and the different thickness of the island pieces based on terrain, the boats having slot like areas so the people are less likely to fall off, the people being bigger and easier to handle and there being places to put everything away back into the box without having to puzzle it together. This, by far, is my favorite design change. Why can't more game designers do this? Overall we loved this version of the game & plan to buy the squid and dolphin packs as well.",5.0
5188,B0084M8UE4,RH41SPX733RFW,Fun! In our family rotation of games.,"  My son, 8 years old, is in LOVE with this game. I was worried that it would be too much ""take that!"" element that it would end in tears. But in this game there are people dying left in right that doesn't feel like he's taking all the hits. And he can retaliate which is nice. He has a habit of making deals or teams, then getting you later when you least expect it. It's not hard to learn and it's fun to play. The board is always set up differently, which adds some variety in gameplay. Though it requires some memory with the people, it isn't necessary since most of the time your people won't make it that long and you'll be happy to get anyone off the island alive.We have all the expansions- but haven't tried them out since the base games if pretty good all on it's own. Highly recommend for familly and/or friends game night.",5.0
5189,B0084M8UE4,R3GX6DUPBKVHOS,"Survive Escape from Atlantis 30th Anniversary is a fun game, with easy-to-follow rules that enable anyone to ...","  Survive Escape from Atlantis 30th Anniversary is a fun game, with easy-to-follow rules that enable anyone to play. Essentially, the premise of the game is that each player is trying to rescue 10 survivors from an island that is quickly sinking into the water (an element that will be familiar to players of Forbidden Island.) The water surrounding the island is infested with sea monsters, which will destroy life rafts and people, sharks, which will eat survivors as they try to swim to safety, and whales, which will destroy boats, but ignore swimmers. Two game mechanics allow players to manipulate the various sea creatures, as well as providing random benefits. The first is a monster die, rolled at the end of each turn, and the second is the printed graphic underneath each bit of island removed from the game by the active player. In the end, the player who has the highest point total from the bases of the rescued survivor pieces wins. The game is simple and colorful, but brutal as players launch monsters at one-another, and scrabble to get on board and gain control of life rafts. I have enjoyed playing this game with my friends, many times, students at my high school, and will soon be sharing the game with my family. I highly recommend Survive Escape from Atlantis!",5.0
5190,B0084M8UE4,R6CG64EJ905T7,A great game where players try to....Survive!,"  This is a great board game, if you don't read any further....I recommend it highly.In Survive, players are on an island, this island is slowing sinking, players have to either swim or paddle their boats to nearby islands to survive.  Around the island though, are sharks, whales, and sea serpents, and they smell fear and blood.  Players throw other players in the direction of the sea creatures.  This is truly a game of ""I don't have to be fast, just faster than you"".  Make alliances, break friendships, become a traitor, do everything necessary to get your meeples onto nearby islands for safety.  Oh, also, it's not how many you save, it's the value underneath the meeples.  Each meeple has a hidden value (1-6) so during the game, no one really knows who is truly in the lead.  Can't king anyone in this game.  The downtime during play is minimal, the turns are quick and the game is always loud with all the chaos and the threats of being attacks, everyone is pleading their case to attack the other.I highly recommend the dolphin expansion, 5-6 player expansion, and Giant Squid expansion.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.",4.0

This game is half offense and half defense. As long as everyone is just out for themselves, this game is a lot of fun. If one person is ganged up on or if ""teams"" are formed, things can get a little ugly.The premise of the game is already described pretty well in the publisher's product description, so I won't go into that any further. What I will say is that the game can be taught to play in about two minutes, and anyone aged 5 or older will be able to play it without any trouble. This game has a fun theme and is very light in terms of concepts and rules, making it an easy entry-level game for anyone who isn't accustomed to ""designer"" games. Play time for the game is around 30 minutes if four people are playing, but shorter is fewer are playing. If you want to expand the game's number of players to five or six, there is an expansion available (

But can you get off the sinking island in one piece?Gameplay: Survive is an excellent medium-light strategy game with twists, disasters and miracles at every turn. The tension builds quickly and never slows down, until all of the explorers reach safety or the volcano BLOWS THE WHOLE game up. During setup, you quickly build the island and strategically place your explorers and boats, and cleverly, as each player takes island tiles away to make the island sink, they also get an action that is painted on the other side of the tile. This can be a helpful dolphin or boat, a monster that can be strategically controlled, or a disastrous whirlpool or volcano. Players win by getting the most of their treasure-rich explorers to safety.Pros: Original and accessible theme, Exciting gameplay, super components and box, FUN.Cons: I'm at a loss here, maybe replayability because of the limited actions.Best For: 3-4 players. Pretty much everyone, except little kids.Final Thoughts: Thank you Stronghold Games for republishing this game! It's hard to believe that such an amazing game came out in 1982, and that strategy-devoid roll and move games are more popular than this. It's so easy to learn and with a perfect blend of strategy and luck, it easily hangs with other modern classics. The weight is a little heavier than Ticket to Ride but a little easier than Catan, and anyone who enjoys those will love this as well. You can probably tell that I am in love with this game.

It is almost unheard of for new versions of games being anywhere close in quality of the original, often replacing original parts and pieces with cheap plastic and cardboard.... the opposite happened here.  The quality of this game goes beyond the original.

There's a lot of strategy involved and can be a lot of back stabbing as it is your opponents who decide which tile gets flipped potentially sending one of your survivors into the water and your opponents also move the sharks, whales, and sea monsters to attack your boats and swimmers. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new game.",5.0
5205,B0084M8UE4,R1WP910EF4E5B0,happy customer,"  I grew up playing the 80s version so I had high expectations for this revamped edition and it is even better than I thought. They really put some thought into how to make this new version great. I bought the game which is fun alone, giving you alternate ways to play in the directions. You can make it just like the original or incorporate any of the new features. I also bought the dolphin and 5-6 player expansion packs, which add fun new dynamics. We've adapted the rules for my 5 year old, making them less strict and as he gets older we can make it more complicated. ( We let swimmers move the full 3 spaces during a turn and don't make them use an extra move to jump on a boat from the same space. We also let the red terrain pieces be used at any point in your turn and as many as you want.) When just the two of us are playing, we sometimes use three colors of players each and use the blue dice plus one red one(having it follow the moving rules for each sea creature as displayed on the board). This is just another example of the many ways you can switch up the game to make it exciting each time you play. Its mine and my five year old's favorite game to play together and with friends.",5.0

It was actually a lot of fun to sabotage the other players and end up swimming with the sharks when they returned the favor. It's a quick game that I would go more in detail on but it's been explained many times in the review. If you are on the wall on whether or not to buy it, take this strangers advice and buy it. It's fun and it's one of the games my kids continuously ask us to bring back out because they like to team up to take us parents out.",5.0

It's so fun it's a regular play game now.  We love it! It has a do or die way about it that makes it exciting. Every move you is taking a chance at death or safety. I also love that you don't know who the winner is till the very end when you turn over the people you rescued off the island and see their hidden values. Side note: great game for teaching ""overly competitive /sore losers""  how to lose a game.",5.0
5208,B0084M8UE4,RWO52FH4Y3EH4,Do you like watching wooden sharks eat your friends?,"  Remeber that old joke where the two friends are camping and a bear shows up and one guy just starts running and the other guy starts putting on his tennis shoes? And the guy who is running stops and says, ""Why are you putting on shoes? You will never outrun that bear!"" and the guy putting on shoes says. ""I just need to outrun you."" ? Remember how kind of funny that one was? That is this game....essentially...but no bears...just Sea Monsters, Sharks, and Whales. Everyone is on Atlantis. Atlantis is sinking and the volcano is rumbling. The island is crowded and there are not enough life boats...oh and the water is teaming with sea creatures that hate you and think you are delicious.  Your goal: Get your people off that island and to safety by any means necissary....and more of them than anyone else, because your people are the most important people and the world doesn't need the other people...so yeah...as long as the sharks and whales and sea monsters are focusing on them, you are home free....maybe a dolphin will see you and come help your stranded self in the water...maybe a strong wind will push your boat beyond it's normal distance...maybe a whirlpool will swallow up half your population....lot's of maybes., and eventualy the Island will sink and the volcano will erupt and everyone not on a safety island will die. Just hope you have more to safety than everyone else. There is cake on those islands. Celebratory ""Survival"" Cake, and you don't like sharing.",5.0

The game is relatively easy to learn, and we only had one real rules question as the rule book is detailed and self-explanatory. The box and it's contents came in pristine condition, and the quality of everything is top notch. I had a good feeling about this game prior to purchasing it, so I ordered the Giant Squid expansion as well. We used it, and had allot of fun with that too!

One question was ‚Äútwo types of snakes‚Äù and someone put ‚Äúlong and short‚Äù.  We laughed and laughed at so many of the questions.  My company kept asking if we could play it just one more time and hours flew by.  This was a real hit and now the other couples want to get their own game or give it to family.

I usually try to get a popular one, aiming for a crowd favorite, and in previous years got the pie face game and whatcha mouth, which were big hits (rolling around in laughter, photo proof of fun, nearly 100% participation). This game just fell way short. We like word games but this was so boring I can‚Äôt even hardly remember what it was like. Maybe we were too old for it (our youngest being 13 I think).

5213,B00UA7O1GW,RN5YPGQJ0PHNR,Laugh out loud fun for the whole family!,"  We recently tried out this game on family game night. The bigger kids - and husband!- were skeptical of a new game being added to the mix. We ended up having a blast! The basic principle is that everyone writes down 2 responses to a game card. (we doubled my youngest with me as my ""helper"" since he can't read or write yet).  The objective is to choose answers that others may choose so that one (ditto) or both (double ditto) of your responses are also responses that other players wrote down. Sort of the opposite of boggle when you only get credit if no one else has your answer. But the topics were cute, the responses hilarious and the competition friendly. We will definitely be playing this one again!!",5.0
5214,B00UA7O1GW,RXXWJPNGZRAX6,Great family game!!,"  We liked this game because it was easyto figure out how to play.  The rules are simple.  Basically, someone picks a card and reads it outloud.  It will say something like,""Things Found in Your Glove Box,"" or ""Hobbies for Rich People.""  Everyone writes down two answers that fit the category. Like for ""Things Found in Your Glove Box,"" players might write flashlight, pocketknife, tire gauge, maps, band aids, snacks, water, or whatever else comes to mind.  Then you go around and see who came up with the same answer(s) as you.  You get points when someone wrote the answer you wrote.  1 point if you have 1 matching answer and 3 points if you have 2 matching answers.Anyway, this game moves fast and keeps everyone active.  Everyone from older kids to Grandma can play.  Great for any game night.  Lots of laughs.",5.0
5215,B00UA7O1GW,R2TKQ2YJ9ZU7E1,So much fun!,"  Bought it a year ago, and sorry it took so long getting around to playing it. Played with 10 people at a New Year's Eve party and it was so much fun. Simple rules. Fast paced. Loved hearing people's answers. We got a little silly with some of our answers. Highly recommend. People that weren't playing, seemed to enjoy watching us play. We did not use the timer. For the most part people could come up with two answers fairly quickly, and if they couldn't we hummed the Jeopardy Think music at them.",5.0

The 15-second timer is just right for coming up with two words, and it's really nice to have 400 cards. The game is nicely packaged and presented, and the instruction sheet is helpful, especially the ""Scoring Points"" section and the  FAQ's. Some of the category cards were unfamiliar to the 7 yr old, but we just moved on to another card for him when that happened. We had a great time playing it. Thanks!",5.0
5217,B00UA7O1GW,R73I52TQAPGGI,Good family fun.,"  We had lots of fun playing this Christmas eve and at a New Year's Eve party, though we decided the timer wasn't really necessary and simply waited until all players acknowledged they had their answers. The included scoring pad is a little lame, not giving much room to actually write answers that are more than a few letters long. When they run out I'll probably design a replacement on my PC and print on a larger piece of paper with more room and clearer score tallying methods.Most topics were family friendly and my 11 year old grandson liked the game a lot, wanting to play it both nights he stayed with us. The New Year's crowd was 100% adult and we still had fun. It was especially interesting to see how often husband & wife came up with the same answers.",4.0
5218,B00UA7O1GW,RJDUCDMJY77R,Boring,"  It's laughable how boring this game is. You all literally just write down two words from the category, and then you get points for words other people also wrote. And there's an awkward scoring system.

5220,B00UA7O1GW,R1BJFGPD4EZQ3Z,Fun and quick game,"  I have 4 kids ages 8-13 and this was a game for all of us to play together. The game was easy to learn, easy for kids to do on their own, and went pretty quickly.The way you play is one person picks a card, reads the cue (ex: ‚ÄúParts of the human body‚Äù or ‚ÄúPrickly things‚Äù), and everyone writes down two answers on their answer card before the timer runs out (which is really quick, maybe 15 seconds). You are trying to match the same answer as someone else in the game, so keep that in mind when writing down answers. When the time is up, go around the group sharing answers. If you match one of your answers with anyone else (or several people), you get one point for a Ditto. If you match both of your answers with other people, you get 3 points, or a Double Ditto. After all answers have been shared, the next person reads a card and you write down new answers again. We fill up the entire answer card (12 rounds) and then add up our scores to find the winner. All of this takes us about 15 minutes to play a whole game.The kids enjoyed it, though they didn‚Äôt request it when we had our next game night. The only negative I have about Double Ditto is it seems a little too simple. If you‚Äôre looking for something challenging for the brain, this isn‚Äôt it. If you want something quick and light, this is for you!",4.0
5221,B00UA7O1GW,R1XIQHQ9FJZSYK,Good for many reasons but not great.,"  This is a good game. It‚Äôs not amazing and it‚Äôs not super clever and it‚Äôs not super fun or funny, but it‚Äôs good. Our family plays a lot of games and this was one of our new Christmas games. Our family of 5 tried it (ages 11 (precocious), 15, 19 and us grown-ups) and thought it was pretty fun. We played again on New Years Eve with a group of 14, and at a different family gathering last night with 12 people, ranging from 11 to 86 years old. It is extremely quick and easy to learn -takes about 30 seconds to explain the game and get started. It is also low stress. It is low-key and everyone feels comfortable. It doesn‚Äôt get competitive people all crazy. It‚Äôs enjoyable to see how people answer. Unlike many games where you are trying to be clever and unique and come up with something no one else can come up with and it‚Äôs stressful, in this game, you are seeking the most common answers. You are trying to guess what everyone else will say. We would recommend this game. It‚Äôs a solid 4 stars. Definitely not 5 in our books- it would have to be more fun or compelling - but it‚Äôs a good ice breaker, it‚Äôs easy, maybe age 6 or 7 and up, works well, even with a large group. Recommended for those reasons.",4.0

We are in a fix in that we are really bored with children's games. We wanted something we can play with our 8 YO son with special needs and our 12 YO who is an honor student.  Believe it or not, this was a great game for the two of them and us adult parents, too! What is also great about this is that it leads to teaching moments where you can explain things to your kids while playing - best kind of teaching! I highly recommend this game for anyone with kids who are in that in-between age.Super clean (no dirty words or anything like that) but still very fun.  It's essentially opposite of Scattergories.",5.0
5224,B00UA7O1GW,R3EM4RJHVVZ71,Lots of fun for everyone!,"  I bought this game for my kids for Christmas, and we have played it at every family gathering since then!  It is great for large groups - and you don't have to sit around a table to play.  The game comes with sheets, but if you need more you can just use plain paper and make your own grid.The rules are simple, and as long as your child can write they can play. My daughter is 8 and we have to skip a few topics she didn't know answers for, but otherwise she loves it. It's hard to find a good game for the 8 year old and the 15 year old but this is one they both enjoy. One group spanned the ages of 8 to 78 and everyone was cracking up!",5.0
5225,B00UA7O1GW,RGKWIUL4MKO4O,Great game for the whole family,"  The game is very easy to learn and play and suitable for all ages. Younger kids who can't write, however, will need help from a non-player adult or can draw pictures instead. Double Ditto is fast-paced and doesn't require any special knowledge. Some of the categories are harder and targeting high-schoolers or adults, e.g., ""movies about the Vietnam war,"" but there are plenty of others, so that even a 4-year-old can participate, e.g., ""things you wear on your head."" I played multiple times with another adult, two 9-year-olds, and a 6-year-old, and we just skipped categories that the kids couldn't understand. Also, if you are not terribly concerned with winning, it's fun to write outrageous things and watch the kids rofl in response. I strongly recommend this game. The kids liked it so much that they didn't even mind losing.",5.0

5227,B00UA7O1GW,R1GRR2B2N2CJB9,Rude Sexism Throughout The Game,"  The game its self is fun but we only played once (12 cards) and at least 4 were sexist. Examples of cards are :Things not to say to your wife, things women wear, countries that oppress women, things women do to their hair etc. And another review had a card that says Ugly Girl Names. Even those playing with us who aren‚Äôt as socially aware felt the game overstepped A line. The game play was quick, fun and easy but the inappropriate cards made us not want to play again. Huge misstep by the makers of This game. There was no reason to include that kind of narrow mindedness in a family game.  On the bright side it did allow me to see that my kids and family were more social conscience than I thought.",2.0

There were 3, 40-somethings, a 16-year old, and a 12-year old. The 12 year old had no difficulty. In fact, she often wrote her answers faster than others (the timer is only 15 seconds!). We got a lot of good laughs at each other's answers. At times, we all thought of the same choice and all said ""ditto."" It was very enjoyable. After playing the first game/round, there was full consensus to immediately play again. I highly recommend this game for a group of all ages.

Takes seconds to learn.I will say it is an entry level game...if your family is big into playing games and your children have more complex thinking abilities,  this probably isn't for you. However, if your family isn't really big into playing games and isn't into complex games this is definitely for you!You will need writing utensils for each player.In my opinion - Good party game for kids and tweens.Not a good party games for teens and adults.",5.0

Most of the cards were great but our 9 year old was a bit stumped on some of the cards like ""bridal shower gifts"" and ""reasons for divorce.""

After exhausting our board game closet and finding very few options that allowed us to play in a large group especially of widely varying ages, Double Ditto has been a spectacular find and enjoyed by all.The premise is quite simple: the reader reads a word or phrase and all the players have 15 seconds to think of 2 answers to the question.  The object is to match your responses with the other players so choosing the most obvious answer is the best strategy, to increase the chances that someone else will match your answer.  This ""simplicity"" is what really made it easier for the younger players to engage and play ""competitively.""Of course - as with my favorite family games - it leaves just enough room for family controversy.  My wife and I still disagree that ""candy bar"" and ""candy"" are the same ""Things in a Vending Machine"" and I'd be embarrassed to admit how much time we've spent on that very debate...  (Her point being that if she asked for a candy bar and I brought gummy bears (certainly ""candy"") I wouldn't have fulfilled the request.)  Science may never know...(The adults among us also enjoy Scattergories and the challenge of trying to out-think each other and come up with creative responses because the objective there is to get points for unique responses.

5270,B087XSQSZ9,R24YIOL6S4I2RH,Fun game - when the decoder is working properly,"  We received an Escape Room the Game as a present last year (games included Secret Agent, Space Station and the Dentist) and really enjoyed playing each one. It's challenging, and each game presents clues and puzzles in interesting ways. It's fun to play with a group, as everyone brings a different skill set and perspective to identify and solve the clues to win the game. It's an added bonus that each game only takes an hour; so it's not an interminable undertaking from the start (like Monopoly). The only downside of this board game is that it's hard to keep all of the pieces intact and organized in the right envelopes for repeat plays (not that you'd want to play the same game twice if you already know how to solve it - but the many pieces makes it hard for a different group of people to play the game another time).However, we purchased this second set of escape rooms to play with out-of-town guests (Basement, Virus, Murder Mystery, Prison Break and Funland), and the experience was super frustrating. This version of the game was defective. When we correctly solved the first clue for the Virus and locked in the corresponding keys to move to the next Part of the game, the decoder told us we were wrong. Confident that we had the right answer (we did), we confirmed our choice on the online walkthrough. Even though we had used the right keys in the right order, the decoder kept telling us we were wrong. We experimented by pushing the same keys down in different orders, and finally the game piece acknowledged the correct answer. Had this malfunction happened on our first run-through of an escape room game, we would have tried to solve the puzzle in a different way and gotten stuck on part one, as we wouldn't know to question the accuracy of the game piece. This happened again with the Murder Mystery game. It interrupted the flow of the game and ate up valuable time trying to make the decoder accept our correct answers. The decoder also subtracts time for each ""wrong"" answer, so even though we kept inputting correct answers in the correct order, it continued to subtract time until miraculously it accepted the correct answer we had all along. It ruined our experience playing the game. I will not purchase another Escape Room game because of this experience.",1.0

If you want a fun family friendly activity that will get you thinking and solving puzzles, then this is the activity for you!Just a note, you really need at least 3 players. We tried Virus and Murder Mystery with just my husband and I and spent 2 1/2 hours working on it. Get one more player (at least) and you'll escape much easier!",5.0
5272,B087XSQSZ9,R25EP374O21UJX,Good games,  We play these escape games all the time now that COVID 19 has taken over and so I consider us average players.  We always play as two players and usually escape.  We loved this set. The hardest one is the murder mystery just because it was a bit hard to see and not like the others in the set. We‚Äôve literally played every one of identity games other escape sets including the jumangi one and I would rate this set as one of the better ones if you‚Äôre looking to just try one game set for the first time.,4.0
5273,B087XSQSZ9,R3MSMK86YJD6BK,Seriously hard,"  Ok, this is a very tough game to play and maneuver thru. 4 college level people and a calculator, a tiny room pic to look at, impossible. We played prison break as they suggest a certain way to play the games in order. Before we play the next game, we are going to try and put the room picture up on the tv so we can see it, or go buy magnifying glasses for everyone. Picture has a flash lite on it so imagine how dark it is.",4.0
5274,B087XSQSZ9,R1EU9Y4LN9XMEI,Not Great - Look Elsewhere,"  My spouse and I are intelligent people and have escaped many real escape rooms. This game could have been so much better! The logic is flawed and the puzzles are poorly designed. The stories are badly written and have spelling errors. Many of the clues are vague and not helpful. Older people and those who are color blind will definitely have a difficult time seeing some important elements and/or colors (we are only in our late 30's). We were only managed to escape the 15-minute trial game and Prison Break under 1 hour. The others took us almost 1 additional hour or over to escape. For the price, there is great value for getting 4 (essentially 5) different games. However, I do not recommend this to anyone who is new to the concept of escape rooms or random puzzles. This game could have been more cleverly designed.",2.0
5275,B087XSQSZ9,RLQN69ES443UT,"Good for one game, fun wears off",  I really wanted to like this. I LOVE escape rooms. I even searched reviews on other sites and I had high hopes.The decoder app only sometimes works. And the clues and setup are clunky and not intuitive. It's not that they're hard...they're just not fun. I wouldn't repurchase or gift but that's just me.I'll try to post some pictures.,3.0
5276,B087XSQSZ9,R32I1HBK0LHWGB,Start with these escape rooms from this series,"  This box set is way more fun than I thought it would, so much so I bought all of the rest from this company that I could find (2 player version, VR version, and the original). I would definitely start with this box and the 4 games that come with it, it has a good range of difficulty and uses a number of different elements in each game. With the decoder, make sure to put the keys in from left to right or the answer will be wrong.",5.0
5277,B087XSQSZ9,R2AKYUBOIQAI8G,Gotta be a better way,"  We tried this for family night, four reasonably intelligent adults. Either the decoder doesn‚Äôt work or the game is impossible. I‚Äôve played a few others that you have to go online and input a code in and we have been able to solve all of those. Kind of frustrating and it took the fun out of it.",1.0
5278,B087XSQSZ9,R1MCME5JB4ZS57,"Some good, some not so good","  First of all, you need to know that these are not replayable. The game is based on working with a main board (a picture of a room, often times), and solving puzzles with the given hints. I really enjoyed a couple of the games, but some of the games, I did not enjoy as much. Felt like the puzzle weren't seemless, so to speak.",3.0
5279,B087XSQSZ9,RLFANC2BE1NTU,Great product. Well thought out game and decent quality.,  Has different levels so you can work up to the hard one. Challenging but not impossible. Seems to work best with 4-6 people.,5.0

Its way too hard for the average player, and not a fun game to play. I played with a very intelligent person and we could not solve it in anywhere close to the time limit. Good escape rooms let you use logic and intuition to solve it, those uses neither.",1.0
5319,B06WWF7297,R3UGEVHF3MC9ZH,Great to  teach concepts of a board game. Perfect for 3-6 year olds.,"  The game is straight forward and easy to play. It takes not more than 30 minutes, oftentimes even less, which is perfect for younger kids. We played it with a 4-year old, 11 year old and 14 year old. It is definitely designed for younger kids but is great when you have kids of different ages and need to find something for them to play together. So, in a nutshell - great for 3-6-year-olds, playable for older kids.",5.0
5320,B06WWF7297,R3NSB0780GTCUM,Such a cute game,"  I actually bought this as a Christmas stocking stuffer for my youngest boy so he‚Äôd have a fun game to play with his cousin while family was here over the holidays. I went to lunch this past weekend and my oldest boy, who is 13, found it in a cabinet and they both ripped it open with glee and started playing (they both LOOOOOVE anything trains and my husband erroneously told them it was okay before checking with me). So, I get home and see them playing it together and having such a good time. It‚Äôs a little too easy for my oldest, but he was enjoying beating his brother so handily. They both said they loved it and thought it was super fun and they enjoyed figuring out the rules and how easy it is to play. It‚Äôs perfect for helping learn colors and numbers, too. They really like the train figures!  It‚Äôs a great clean family fun game.",5.0
5321,B06WWF7297,R3RDJ5G1N0R4NJ,"Fun game, simple to learn","  This is a great game for a 3-5 year old who are learning to count.  It is so simple to learn.  If you're having problems with it (as some of the other reviews do), you're probably overthinking it.  Fill up the train station, take 2 at a time to fill your rail cards.  Draw a card when you fill it.  Play the card when you want.  That's about it.  A game takes 5 minutes.",5.0
5322,B06WWF7297,R31CNQ5Y9W0LS1,Fantastic Game,"  We got this for our two youngest, ages 3 and 5, as a Christmas gift.  It sounded good, but you never can tell until you actually play.  Well, this one did not disappoint!  It is an awesome game!  It is simple enough that the very young can play and it is super easy to learn the game play, but there is enough strategy to keep it fun and interesting.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this game was as fun and easy, yet complex!  I know, it probably sounds almost contradictory...  I was surprised when by the second game my 3 year old new which cards he could use to steal another train or wreck someone's rail.  This is really a fantastic game!!",5.0
5323,B06WWF7297,R103AROOO153XR,Really Cute but it needs something,  Game pieces and board look really beautiful and durable however the instruction are really vague on how to actually set up the game. Stick trains on track then somewhere else it says fill back up when your down to three. I need to know how many trains! It only took about 5-10 minutes to play with my 4 & 7 year olds.They wanna play again so it wasn't a failure but I feel like its fun will wane very quickly. It needs a die or spinner or something else as it kinda boring that you just take train off the track until someone completes their first track. Just needs a little something more and it would be so perfect. Maybe start with some power up cards to make thing more interesting in the begaining?Bonus: the trains are super cute. We will probably steal them for math.,4.0
5324,B06WWF7297,R3SBSXXAGZFXIY,Great for the little ones!,"  My 4 and 6 year old loved this game! It was easy for them to learn and they had a great time playing! It helps learn colors, matching, etc and it‚Äôs finally a game the little ones can play. The only downside to this game is that it only comes with 4 boards (we are a family of 5) so one of us has to sit out each round but otherwise, great option for the littles who always want to play games with you but are never old enough to understand!",5.0

We have followed the instructions and it makes absolutely no sense. It comes with 1 ‚Äútrain station‚Äù card, 4 ‚Äútrain card‚Äù cards, and a bunch of ‚ÄúBonus‚Äù cards that are all bad cards. The ‚Äú1 extra train‚Äù card seems the be the only positive card, but... you can only use it once you complete your train?!. How tf do you complete your train?! Can someone please explain?! My 4 year old really wants to play this but we cannot figure it out. Grrr.",1.0
5326,B06WWF7297,R3MG3ZCXII9YJW,Fun enough game for patient players,"  I was on the fence about this one. I thought the train-shaped pieces would up the fun factor enough for a 2.5-year-old. He's played three times and makes it most of the way through. But he's always gotten bored enough to leave before the end. His 4.5-year-old brother really likes it, though. I agree with other reviewers that the Power Cards could be more positive and more interesting. It's a bummer when games for young kids pit players against each other. I'm for competition; it doesn't have to be all co-op games. But even a ""trade"" card might be better than making someone else lose a turn. I recommend this if your kids are 4+ and can sit still for awhile.",4.0
5327,B06WWF7297,R1OBSF994JFM63,Simple but fun,  This is a very simple game but it‚Äôs one of the only board games that we can play as a family with our 3 and 5 year olds. It‚Äôs short enough and turns move quickly that they don‚Äôt lose interest and there‚Äôs just enough opportunity to reinforce counting and colors. It‚Äôs great to be able to play a simple game to work on the concept of being a gracious winner OR loser.,5.0

During the busiest time of year, the Sunday before Christmas I had an email reply within an hour of reaching out and a deck of cards will be mailed. I was not expecting a reply until after Christmas. Thank you! - This looks like a fun game my 4 year old would love to play. However, it arrived with no deck of cards.

Fantastic game for learning colors, as a first board game, and for the train enthusiast in your life.The game board is sturdy and well made. Plus each kid gets his/her own board which takes care of all the disputes about where pieces should go. Hoorah! The trains are great quality and come in a nice velour bag that keeps them well contained. Kids pull the colored trains out of the bag and put it on its corresponding railroad. When one railroad is full, they collect a card. Sometimes we like to take a few of the cards out for easier game play. My son can play with his three-year-old friend and by himself easily.

You have to know history on company‚Äôs, dates, who founded etc. there were a few (maybe 6 give or take a couple when I quickly looked through the cards) that were pics of a logo of a place/grocery/food item to have to name. That‚Äôs what we thought it was. Not even close!  My kids told us about a game they play with friends and sometimes in school to study for tests or ‚Äúeducation Fun‚Äù called Kahoot that is online.

We first tried it out on family game night with just 4 people, mom, dad, daughter 12, son 10. It was fun and we all enjoyed. It was funny to whitness the ah-ha moment when my kids realized that it's not necessarily how you would answer the question, but how you think the rest of the players would answer. It clicked with a donut question. Knowing my two kids would say Boston cream, that is how I replied as well. When we read our responses, the kids were like, but mom you like jelly, and I explained yes, but I'm the only one that likes jelly, then it clicked! Then because we know each other so well, we had a lot of the same answers. When we played with a larger group of friends it really got interesting because we didn't know them as well as our family and couldn't predict their answers as easily. Much more fun and the cow passed around more often.  This is a great ice breaker game, it sparked conversations and side bar debates. Everyone was involved and having fun. The game is well made and sturdy enough to lug to your friends house. I love the flocked cow spots on the box and the cute pink cow. Overall a great addition to your game collection and one you'll reach for often!",5.0
5394,B085BM49M9,R3B7DCMDG8ZS2K,Surprised at how fun this is!,"  This is a great party game in which everyone tries to come up with the same answers as everyone else to questions that range from the expected (""name a band/movie/series that begins with the letter 'B"") to what is the best of three choices to come from a particular country, etc.It's not just putting down your own actual answers that's important in this game -- it's in trying to match the other players' answers. If your answer is in the majority, you gain one little cow. If you are the only one whose answer was unique you also gain the big pink cow and while you have it you can keep gaining little cows but you can't win the game. The only way to get rid of the big pink cow is for someone else to get it.The first person to get eight cows and not have the giant cow wins.And that's it.The only reason this game doesn't get 5 stars is that there aren't really enough cards if you're going to be playing with the same group (though I imagine if it does well there will be additional content released).",4.0

This one is particularly unique and fun. The rules are not complex, both adults and kids can learn it in a few minutes. But there are a lot of strategies you can explore and use. The game requires a good sense of space where a lot of other games don't require.My only suggestion: I'd like to see some facts (name, habitat in real world) of the animals printed on back of the card or in a different booklet attached to the box. This helps kids learn more about the animals in the game.",5.0

Planet is amazing.With our 6 year old, we played without the habitat cards and just scored animals at 1/card. She got the hang of it right away and stayed focused and engaged for the whole 40 minute game!With our adult gaming, we had a blast exploring which strategies were more/less successful and why.The game itself is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to play.The structure and rules of play are mentally stimulating and fun. We found play to be more intuitive once we got going with it, even though a few things seemed confusing from just reading through the manual.A+!",5.0

Similar in gameplay but not in form, this game is exploding with style. Very fun and quick to play, and even a joy just having it on the table. The only slight I would give it and it's enough to keep it from 5 stars, is that the scoring can be confusing... Not that it's not explained well in the rule book (that part is great), the issue is rotating it at the end and trying to keep up with what parts you have scored one your planet is complete.",4.0

They have a lot of unique games that you don't find at big box stores.  Planet looked and sounded good for an ""environmental awareness"" game.  It was unique and looked good.  The planet balls were very creative and fun to use.  I watched an online video so it was pretty easy to pick-up how to play.I've played it a couple of times now.  It's fun, like okay.  It's not super-fun.  It's not boring but it's not something that I would go back to a bunch.My biggest complaint, or suggestion---Why did they not provide the names of the animals or basic facts or anything on the animal cards?  That would have been a great learning opportunity.  I don't know the names of all the animals, much less where they live.So it's not a bad game, but I don't know if I would buy it again.  If you're on the fence, you should watch a video and see what you think about it.",3.0
5404,B07N8FN8R1,R2DH25F6UZBJNX,Great step up from Kingdomino,"  My wife and I are great fans of Kingdomino. We are vets. We play monthly and anytime we go to the brewery, it's coming with us. I buy just about any Blue Orange game because we are a family of 5 and their games are so good for families. That being said, this is Kingdomino on a spherical planet. You attach your magnetic tiles and compete with other players to figure out who ""captures"" certain animals with specific lands. Think; try to get crowns for regions in Kingdomino you have to have the most of that specific region. The game is easy to learn but it has a steep learning curve and the randomness of the cards that are played, not the tiles, make this game a lot of fun. Especially for kids, kids love tile placement games (From my experience). Blue Orange delivers another staple in their library, and mine as well tbh.",4.0
5405,B07N8FN8R1,RR92N1GNHDACN,Blue planet is a safe quality bet for a family game.,  It is a drafting game that is simple to learn and good for kids. They have cute animals that you try to win but if you focus only on the animals and let the other player(s) build the planet that gives them the max bonus they will win but kids don't tend to matter because they have the coolest or cutest animals.,4.0
5406,B07N8FN8R1,R20JMOIGA9S1IN,"Brilliant. Easy to learn, deep enough for strategists","  My 6-year-old and I love this game, and he understands it enough to play it well. I love the artwork in this game; it is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played. I also very much enjoy how this game has broken out of the traditional game boards with the planet ""cores."" I appreciate that it's really easy for beginners to pick up, and it's complex enough that it's hard to come up with a repeatable strategy. The replay value is excellent. One of the best games I've ever bought. If I had to find something about it that could be improved, I would swap the scoring rules for the animals from your natural habitat and other habitats. We've found it to be quite difficult to get a lot of animals from your own natural habitat because of the ""not adjacent to"" cards, so it seems like they deserve a bonus rather than a penalty.",5.0
5407,B07N8FN8R1,R1OQNJOFN38FGL,This is a fun game!,"  I bought this game based on the reviews, and I was not disappointed. You can figure out after a few turns what type of habitat each player has. If an animal gets passed over 3 turns, we discard that animal and choose a new replacement from the unused cards. The kids are a little competitive about who wins, but it‚Äôs pretty fair because you work on creating your own world, and your total points are based on that. The games don‚Äôt last long and that‚Äôs nice for the adults lol. It looks complicated at first, but we found a you tube video that explained it thoroughly, and we easily figured it out after the first game. The only thing not explained in the rules is whether you can move the tiles once you‚Äôve placed them, but we decided (just like a real world scenario) that once a tile is placed, it‚Äôs permanent. This is a nice addition to our board games.",5.0

We might actually hide this one because we loved playing it as a couple.It‚Äôs super quick to learn, highly replayable, and a lot of fun.This would probably make a great birthday gift for anyone who enjoys strategy games. The creators have included two variations - one that makes the game more enjoyable for younger players and another that increases the importance if luck over strategy.Game pieces are high quality. I was worried about the magnets peeling or creasing (from bending) when removing them from the core but they are thicker than I expected and well crafted.",5.0

5410,B07N8FN8R1,R3E0KVZORGMOIO,Great game with kids. Not so great magnets.,"  Bought the game to play with my kids between 5 and 10. They enjoyed it though obviously the older one grasped the concept and strategy more.Overall it's a great game. My one nagging complaint is that in the promotional artwork and in other reviewer's pictures their ""planets"" have silvery metallic looking pieces for the magnetic tiles to grab. Mine are smaller blue plastic circles which I assume are covering a lightweight metal for the tiles to cling to. It seems minor but it allows for the environment tiles to slip or fall off easily. Clearly with young children who want to fiddle with their planet that's a problem. Yet allowing them to fiddle with their planet is a primary part of the appeal of the game.I get that things like this go through revisions to keep costs down but this is one area they should not have skimped on. That's my opinion anyway.",4.0
5411,B07N8FN8R1,R38BKI2TWYXOVJ,Fun game,"  Really fun game. I can't wrap my mind around playing the ""proper"" way, but just following the basic rules is really fun. My 8 year old figured it out easily, and has been able to teach her friends how it works when we have visitors.",4.0

The concepts and game play are simple and my 9-year old was bored by the second game.

I don't even know where to start! 1) I read this book in less than 3 days...I couldn't put it down, 2) WHEN is part II coming out because that CLIFFHANGER is REAL.The plot to Board Games was VERY well written and thought out - I was locked in from chapter one. I hated when I had to put the book down because I couldn't do anything but think about what was going to happen next. Board Games gives you everything you need: drama, romance, crime and suspense; definitely something for every reader.  The imagery was excellent - I could visualize everything from how FINE Vince Brown is to how emmaculate Roland's house looks. He really pulls you into the storyline and allows you to be IN the story. I loved it.If Board Games was a movie (*crosses fingers*) you'll definitely need to stay after the credits to catch the REAL cliffhanger and plot twist. I won't give any spoilers in this review but the book doesn't end with Chapter 23, you'll want to read the author's last excerpt that puts all of the pieces of the puzzle together and drops the final plot twist that left me like WHAAAAA...!!!This was a great read - he's set the bar high and I look forward to reading more from this author - specifically how Marcus Dreer's takeover truly ends.",5.0

5457,B086N314TX,R24E75GBKBXNZG,Great but has some outside (fixable) problems.,"  First off i want to say that this game is really really fun. I've just got it today and my family really enjoys it, but i just can't really give this product 5 stars. My biggest problem has to do with how long to ship, I get that sometimes it may take a while to ship, but when I order on September 14th(to arrive on the 28th), just to have my package canceled for no reason, just to have to buy prime and buy the game again just to get it close to the original shipdate(now October 1st but could have been Oct 9th without prime) is kinda infuriating just because they don't have everything organized between Big Potato and Amazon. Second is a problem that will most likely be fixed in the future. The expansion packs aren't for sale yet meaning you cannot get the full experience as of late, which is fine on it's own, but when the box has an cardboard box place holding for the expansion pass that says I need the expansion on it, that also is kinda alittle saddening.

5472,0786955708,R274TULZHBXH8D,The best among the D&D boardgames,"  Loads of fun. If you've played any of the other D&D boardgames, this is more of the same. This set (Wrath of Ashardalon), in my opinion, is the most well-rounded among them all. It includes gold tokens which you can spend on buying treasures between adventures, a balanced set of heroes with memorable and unique abilities without being overpowered so as to make the game too easy, and the most relatable setting.For those of you who haven't played the other boardgames, you don't have to own them all. Each one is a standalone game, but the rules, board pieces, cards, and characters are all interchangeable with each other. This game is a dungeon crawl, where each turn you explore a new room of the dungeon and deal with the things you find there - be it a monster, a trap, an encounter, or any/all of the above.It's fully co-operative; there is no need for one player to be a dungeon master who plays by different rules from the others and acts as the ""villain,"" so you can even play this game solo if you really wanted to. The ""AI"" or rules for each of the monsters that you encounter in the game is determined by its card, so you don't have to worry about making people feel like they're being singled out (i.e. this game won't break friendships unlike Risk or Monopoly).It's very approachable and you don't have to have ever played a game of Dungeons and Dragons to understand or even appreciate it. On the other hand, this could actually be a great way to introduce people to D&D if you're so inclined, as the rules are distilled and simplified versions of the actual tabletop roleplaying game.A typical round of play, including set-up and pack-up, could last anywhere between 45 minutes to 2 hours on the extreme end.",5.0
5473,0786955708,R88HT1QR1ZSPH,Buyer's remorse,"  This game just isn't for me, and I'm sad that I paid so much money for it. The reviews for it were all good and I was hoping for a sort of ""D&D Lite"" sort of board game I could use to introduce my friends to D&D. However, in true 4th edition fashion, the game is very complicated and not very fun. I was expecting based on the descriptions and stuff that it'd be somewhat like a mix between D&D and Betrayal at House on the Hill, but there's just too much fighting, and the game itself is really really hard.Oh well. At least it came with some great miniatures I can use in other games.",2.0
5474,0786955708,R2KBMENU7QUTT4,"Good quality, extreamly challenging","  This is a standalone D&D themed board game that you can play with 1 to 5 players. Yes, that means you can play the game by yourself, and I recommend doing so the first time you play so that you can get a handle of the rules and be in a better position to help others in the future. This single player aspect is actually what drew me towards this game. I love D&D, and I love board games, but my wife only occasionally plays games. So this was something I could play on my own. However, I was a bit disappointed that in the scenario booklet that comes with the game there is only a single scenario for 1 player. All of the others say you need at least two people. Bummer.That aside, the tiles and cards are all excellent quality and I have confidence that they'll hold up well. I was truly impressed with this. Conversely, I was a bit disappointed in the figures. They're made of a soft plastic which is fine for the more solid figures, but doesn't work so well with things like swords that end up being really flimsy and bent in odd angles. They're not poorly made, I'm just not sure the soft plastic is a better choice over a hard plastic.The game itself is extremely challenging. And I mean *really* hard. I'm sure there are harder games out there, but this is by far the most challenging board game I have ever played. Every single turn you are under attack, there is never any rest. More often than not, you will be under attack from two different sources *every* turn in the form of a monster and an encounter card. Each monster you kill gives you experience which you can 'spend' to counter the encounter cards, but you need 5 exp to do so and monsters give 1-3 exp each and generally take at least 2 turns to kill each and that's if you hit both turns. So, you can counter 1 encounter card every 4+ turns (usually more like 6) however, you also need 5 exp to 'level up' your characters which you can only do if you roll a 20 or get a special treasure card.My family all found the challenge of this game to be just too much. As an example if you're playing a cleric, who in D&D wears heavy armor and usually a shield, has an AC of 16. Well, most enemies have a +7 to +11 to their attack. That means they have a 60-80% chance of hitting you, and many enemies cause a 'dazed' or 'poisoned' trait to also be added. You don't even want to know about weaker armored units. Numerous encounters and enemies will also do damage even if they do miss (just less than if they hit). Because of these insanely high chances your characters are pretty much *always* loosing health. If even a single hero dies, it's game over. We haven't been able to win a single game yet. Clearly something isn't 'clicking' with anyone of us on just how to win at this game, but the result is that none of us enjoy playing the game and it's now collecting dust.I can only recommend this game to people who enjoy a tough challenge and want every scenario they play to be a nail biting experience.",3.0
5475,0786955708,R1BJ9EFH9W9PUU,Fun game with great minis for your D&D campaign,"  This was the first of the D&D board games that I bought and since then I have also purchased Castle Ravenloft. Like all the Dungeon and Dragons board games they use the same game mechanics and play system. I bought my first box set for the minis figuring that if I played the game that was a bonus. I played this game with my son (age 7) and daughter (age 17) and we all had a blast. My son really enjoys these games and we play them about once a week.The game plays with a simplified D&D combat mechanic using only one 20 sided dice. I watch the YouTube Watch It Played video prior to playing so it was pretty easy to pick up and play. I found that even with the game rules you may still need to make some small ""home rules"" for specific events and how you read the rules. The plan is on evening when my home group is supposed to get together but we are missing a couple players we may play this game instead.The minis are pretty good. They are decent quality especially when you think about the fact you are paying about $1/mini and you get 2 large and 1 huge mini. I use these in the two D&D games that I run.Overall a great purchase for just the minis but I am finding that I am also really enjoying playing the game with my kids and hope it will serve a gateway to my son playing D&D in the future.

So I bought it,  I'd recently tried playing Stuffed Fables and She didn't like the slow pace of that game,  and I thought time to bring out ""Wrath of Arshardalon""  I was not disappointed.

I imagine Dungeons AND Dragons, which is exactly what this is. You fight the biggest, meanest, most voracious Dragon the demigod Ashardalon in his dungeon. There is no Dungeon Master, just players getting together for an express D20 getaway. Are there other games? YeahPerhaps they are more detailed? YupDeeper? IndeedBut I had a blast with a game that to me can be lighthearted and quick or (with a little imagination)  an in depth full on DnD experience with many steps in between with the more characteristic features of the grandady of all RPGs.I absolutely love it. This reminds me of the game called Dungeon that made many a happy afternoon when the NES was the hot thing in the market and dinosaurs ruled the earth.Figures are very well made, as are all the other assets... Fully compatible with normal DnDCheck let's plays to see if the game style is your kinda thing; some hate it so check it and judge that aspect on its own merit.

5478,0786955708,RWRMW5N788XHA,"Good deal for the minis, the actual game is pretty dull.","  I'm assuming many people are buying this for the miniatures like I did. On that front it is quite a good deal. You get enough nice cardboard tiles to make some simple dungeons with. The miniatures were mostly in good shape, the moulds used are detailed and the monster variety is good. Some of the bases on the the bigger models seemed a little bent. If you are planning on painting these, you were probably already planning on putting new bases on anyway.As for the actual game itself, I don't know. I tried playing the single player scenario and the book and it seemed incredibly simple and boring to me. The 4th Ed. D&D rules have been stripped down so much that this is D&D in name and flavour only really. The huge blocks of cards that come with the game, aren't really that attractive and it would take some heavy modifying to get them to where they were usable in an actual game of D&D.For 50 bucks I got a nice stack of dungeon tiles and big bag of around 40 miniatures. Overall I'm pleased and I've decided to purchase Ravenloft now too. The game itself is boring and simplistic but might be enjoyable to play with kids who aren't yet old enough to handle the full D&D rules.",4.0
5479,0786955708,R2148SMLKDVY9C,Artificial difficulty and not enough rewards to be fun,"  While I like the basic structure of the game they laid out, and my friends and I were looking for something to play together after pathfinder, this game suffers from what feels like a fundamental design flaw: you are penalized for not rushing.We suffered through the first adventure and if we play again we are going to use half a dozen house rules to tone down the difficulty.  Every encounter is bad for you, and they happen during every players turn effectively.  Unless you're a monster at rolling, this means you're taking shots left, right and center while the board keeps adding traps, effects and monsters.  Theres also almost no way to earn treasure so if you happen to start with a mostly useless item... too bad.I wanted to love this game, but I just can't.  It's the Dark Souls of board games, and I play games to have fun and enjoy time with friends.  I dont want to steamroll everything in the game, but I don't want to feel desperate all game either.

What I got was a confused, jumbled mess of a game with a bazillion cards and tokens to keep track of. We spend 20 minutes before playing sorting out all the little bits. The game instructions are confusing and leave out important information that we have to guess on. Gameplay is tedious and repetitive, and the kids get bored quickly. It's a shame, because they have a lot of fun playing with the figurines, which do seem to be fairly good quality.Do not recommend. Just pick up a used D&D rulebook and dive in the deep end.

5481,0786955708,RJ6WVH37LWDGV,Great co-op game: rules need some help,"  Wife and I played our first co-op crawl and had fun. Single die (1d20) to roll for everything!Rules leave a little to the imagination witch is a bit frustrating when it comes to board games like this. Not that you'd expect EVERYTHING to have been answered, but there are some empty spaces in the rules that just slow down the game when you can't find what you're looking for and have to ""vote"" on it.It's been mentioned before, but the tiles are ultra bland. All gray squares or brown squares. Not at all pretty. Functional, but ugly. Also, I tire of the excessive use of ""customized"" counters in these games. TONS of little pieces to keep track of in baggies that would better benefit as extra dice in the box or some form of spinner to dial in my HP. Get creative on how you track consumables in WoA and you'll save yourself some grief. My wife and I use appropriate size dice for health instead of handfuls of ""HP"" chips.All in all still a really fun game. Minis look pretty good. I think the makers of Descent put more effort in their product in terms of miniature and dungeon tile quality/detail, but that's a competitive game. Get this if you like co-op dungeon crawling.

It can also be combined with other games from the same series. The adventures can be played as one offs or a campaign - which is how we are doing it. The miniatures are great and a blast to paint if you are into that hobby. The price might seem a little steep, but is well worth it thanks to everything that comes in the box. Highly recommend.",5.0
5483,0786955708,R1WOQ7FX6HMDV,D&D Lite For Those With Limited Time,"  Who am I:Middle aged married guy who loves Sci fi, video games and fantasy novels. Used to play D&D and then AD&D around twenty years ago. Haven't been involved with any serious groups since then so I have no experience with any editions of D&D that cause such a rift in the community. This means that I am not hopelessly in love with any specific Edition of D&D.-Note for various D&D Edition FanGirls and FanBoys- If you are a 4th Edition Hater and can't get past that, you most likely will not enjoy these games as they are based, in general, on the 4th Edition rule set. If you don't know what that statement means, or if you are capable of enjoying what each Edition has to offer, you should have no problems.Why I love the D&D Adventure Systems:Castle Ravenloft(CR), Wrath of Ashardalon(WoA) and Legend of Drizzt(LoD): They work as a stand alone product and offer a dungeon crawling, limited leveling, monster slaying experience with no previous knowledge of how D&D works. And all in sessions that can be finished in an hour or two. The minimal time commitment involved is fantastic.Or, if you find yourself filled with nostalgia and desire a fuller, longer campaign with further leveling options or new characters, these games can be tweaked to allow for that. Especially with some of the user created content online, the photoshop templates on boardgamegeek.com in particular are wonderful. Also this [....]address has a plethora of new content. The extra leveling options are definitely my favorite. The truth is that I screamed in happiness when I ran across them. I sounded like a ten year old girl getting a pony. A unicorn pony. with wings. A Unicorn Pegasus Pony that appeared in a shimmer of rainbow colors. And now I am deeply ashamed...........*sigh* I am such a nerd.The game system totally allows for expandability in many ways. It's kind of a gateway drug for D&D honestly. I find myself consistently wanting just a bit more of the actual RPG experience. We tweak the game a bit and suddenly our experience is just a bit fuller and more satisfying. Not nearly as detailed and time intensive as an actual D&D or Pathfinder game though. Such a great balance for us.They don't have to be expanded upon though, to be immensely enjoyable. Any of the three games are enough in and of themselves to be hugely gratifying and offer much re-playability. The expandability is just something that makes them extra cool and versatile in my opinion.All three systems use totally interchangeable materials. Some of the cards may be context sensitive and not seem to fit in a particular environment but other than that you can use everything in each of the games. This provides Awesomeness Bonus of +2.The map tiles and figurines both are an unbeatable value and can be easily incorporated into a ""real"" D&D session.Everything in the box, other than the manuals, is of superb quality. The figurines alone would easily cost you double what you pay for the set here. And if you paint figurines, which I do, you will have just gained around forty new minis to paint. Joy in and of itself there.Possible Cons:I saw in the review for one of the three games that some dude was just totally disgusted with how these games ""punish"" the players for almost every activity they engage in. The guy was totally a Hater. However, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The game does seem to be constantly throwing things at you that often don't feel fair. Notably, the Encounter cards. Which brings me to the next con and a solution to the ""punishment"" issue....The instruction manual will not answer every question that will come up. It is left up to the players to decide how certain things should work. Which is how a ""real"" D&D game works. Your group plays the game the way they want to play it. If you simply cannot function without every rule spelled out for you, this may be a problem. Otherwise you'll be fine. And in terms of rule tweaking and the punishment issue- we decided to change how often we draw encounter cards as well as a couple other minor aspects of the game. This has served to make our sessions a lot more fun. Don't be afraid to tweak the rules in order to play the game how you want to play it.The manuals are pretty cheaply put together. They may not hold up well to use by younger players or spilled drinks. I took ours apart and put the pages in plastic binder inserts. We now have all the material for all the games in a single, sturdy, custom decorated notebook. Which is awesome btw. (Disclaimer for claim of awesomeness: I created the custom artwork:)Space. With all the cards and map tiles and bags of monsters and tokens that get used in a typical session, you may find you need a bit more space than an average board game. All of the aforementioned items can quickly end up being a mess. As a solution we have everything securely contained in varying sizes of ziplock bags. Including the map tiles in a 1 Gallon size bag. Perfect for storage and during play.There is no actual role playing or in town scenarios. If you want to get into a brawl over the serving wench's honor at The Yawning Portal Inn in the city of Waterdeep, then you should just find a gaming group and play Pathfinder or D&D(any Edition). Or perhaps, after stumbling into a gathering of Dirty Orcs in the Gloomy Forest of Gloom and Terror, you want to attempt to use an illusion to convince them you are a deity and sell them into slavery in the Land of Thay. As opposed to just killing them. Again, just go find a full-on game of D&D. These systems can be worked to allow for things like that to some degree, but they aren't designed to be open world or allow for anything other than a dungeon crawl with combat and a final, combat based, objective.So:If you want ""real"" D&D, then you may be more satisfied finding a group and getting involved.If you want a game that allows you to engage in D20 based combat, with figurines, that represent a character with minimal leveling capacity. And that can be played by anyone. These systems may be just the thing for you.Also of note: The Dungeon Command games have interchangeable map tiles, monster cards and figurines that can be used seamlessly with the Adventure Systems. I love this as it ads even more expansion options.",5.0

Arround 60 minis with good detail great for any D&D compaign and ideal for painting.If you consider the cost of buying individual miniatures you would have to invest 5 times more.A must have for table top and roll game fans",5.0

This (and the other products in this line) are an excellent value for the content that you receive; you simply cannot find an equivalent deal on the number of miniatures, tokens and dungeon tiles that are in this box.I use the components for DM'ing 5e D&D games and am extremely satisfied. The game itself is also great for introducing new players to a D&D lite that serves as a gateway for pulling them deeper into full role playing.

WoA is what most recommend as the one to get if you just get one -- it's difficulty is average (unlike CR which is cruel) and the heroes are good. These D&D games are so much fun because it truly is a ""system"" of sorts. You will end up having a ton of little figurines (sadly not painted the way some other games have them, but then again you get so many of it it only makes sense!), a bajillion little tokens, and an amazingly well illustrated rulebook, along with a really good collection of scenarios to play (a lot of 'em!).This game, when you have the 1-2.5hrs needed for some of the scenarios with friends, just plays so well with the whole group. It's truly cooperative, every character is different and everyone can contribute into the fun.I do suggest that if you buy this game, play it for a bit w/ the base rules, and if you ever start feeling like you are finding it ""a bit mechanically repetitive"" then pause, go to boardgamegeek and find the variants (one I published in fact) that allow for an ""Initiative"" system - it will change everything and you'll be back to enjoy this game in no time!Absolutely worth every penny when it is ~ $40.",5.0
5491,0786955708,RZJNC4Q9OYNHD,Recommended,"  I played 2nd edition AD&D growing up.  My son and I enjoyed a game of Hero Quest or two but I always found it a bit cumbersome.  We‚Äôre loving this combo of the two.  The mini‚Äôs are made of slightly softer material.  Some came squished.  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs nothing some boiling water can‚Äôt fix.  My only objection is a lack of character progression through the campaign.  But at the same time, it makes it really easy to just pick a quest and start playing.  Overall, a great board game sustem.

I never played D&D for those very reasons, but after doing some research on this game, I found out that you can play solo. There are 13 adventues included, and the replay value is high since the adventures are unfolded differently each time by how the dungeon tiles are shuffled, along with the creature/treasure/encounter cards. The rule book is thankfully thin, and is mostly clear with it's delivery. There are a ton of pieces, but as long as you have some sandwich bags, you should be ok.So far I've completed the first adventure, and I like how they didn't throw all of the rules at you (locked doors, for example).I also like the idea of taking the components from the other 3 games and putting them together for one giant adventure.I subtracted a star just because the tokens and pieces should have been organized in bags, and some of the rules seem confusing (but not enough to distract the player from having fun).Highly recommended.

It's easy to learn, but advanced enough to still be fun for experienced tabletop gamers. The components are very well made. The miniatures are unpainted, but for me that was a perk.The gameplay is fun if you like exploration and the classic dungeon crawl. The random encounters can feel a bit unforgiving at times, however the game does allow you to mitigate this by spending xp from monster kills. With a little creativity it would be very easy to expand on the game and create your own quests or objectives.As far as value goes, you would pay almost as much for the miniatures alone, so getting a full boardgame on top with tiles and cards feels like a great bargain.",5.0

5499,0786955708,R3J6JIAB6HRNGU,Great dungeon crawler with a few minor complaints.,"  I was attracted to this game and its counterparts (Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt) mainly because there is a one-player option. There are plenty of times where I'd like to play but no one is available to play. Single or multi player, it seems to be a solid game.My only complaints are that the punch out tiles seem to be a BIT less of quality when compared to other big box games like Descent Second Edition. I noticed when I was punching out the tiles, there was a lot of debris on the table. Maybe a poor cut in the sheet, but annoying in any event. They also are prone to tearing if you aren't careful when taking them out. But once they are punched out, they seem to be pretty solid. The playing cards are also a bit thinner than other games. Not too big of a deal since most players buy sleeves for all their cards, so that I can live with. Lastly, the adventure book and rule book are pretty flimsy.The minis are of great quality and there are a lot of them. Wizards of the Coast never disappoints in this department IMHO.All in all, if the punch outs are carefully taken out and the cards and books are stored properly, there should be no issue.For a sale price of $38, I couldn't pass this up, but I would be VERY hesitant to pay full blown retail price.Definitely worth picking up for solo adventures or a good solid game night.",4.0

I was wary of purchasing something with such a lack of reviews, and then incredibly mixed reviews across the internet, but finally decided to take the chance. I could not be any more pleased with a purchase!This chess set comes is in a very sturdy cardboard box that keeps the beautiful wood safe from scratches. The pieces are all a pleasant weight, and the magnets seem to work very well. No more spills and bumps that mess the board up. Yay!I must add that it came out of the box smelling like wood, and not a factory, which made me very happy. (A different chess set I purchased from another company was not pleasant smelling)While the chess pieces will ride in their felt storage perfectly as you play checkers, the checker pieces will not return the favor, so they must be pulled out and set aside before you play chess (though, a rubber band helps keep them in place). That, however, is the only rub with this set.Coming from a mom, dad, and two preteen boys, we LOVE this chess set and highly recommend it.",5.0

There's a little gap between the two gameboard pieces when it's laying out and a piece of the edge chipped off the first time I opened it.  It looks like it will chip further in the near future.

5561,B088MM6G5B,RZ44BZ5JW9VK4,"rough finish, almost no slide","  Just got this. Faster than advertised delivery, that was great! Graphics are awesome, (see pic). Set it up in the backyard and started tossing bags. Bags aren't great, just bargain bags, all canvas with corn, but appear sturdy enough to last a decent time. The boards are not perfectly fitted, but good enough for the backyard and will likely last quite awhile. They are framed of 1"" X 2"" pine with 1/2"" ply boards (see pic). Both boards have pretty rough finishes! There is NO WAY a canvas bag will slide, (see pic). The bags hit and stick, or maybe bounce. So my gripe is the finish. I expected a smoother finish. I will buy two-sided bags and update this, after  testing the new bags, in a couple weeks.Update: new, better bags added no more slide. Maybe with more play the boards will smooth out. No change on rating. Really wish they came smoother outta the box.",3.0

My husband and I love to play scrabble and have had roughly 6-8 boards over our 30 years of marriage.  We've always had travel or more portable ones to travel with.  Our oldest son ""borrowed"" our other one so I went ahead and ordered this for us and LOVE IT!  At first I was worried it was too small (as we are getting older) however, now I even may take to restaurants instead of our 16 year old and husband being on their phones (I'm guilty too when everyone else is on theirs).

I chose this one because it's portable.My kit is well-assembled and stained, unlike some of the others that have been reviewed. The boards easily slide out to reveal compartments for trays, a scorebook, a golf pencil, a bag of 100 wooden tiles, and a paper rule book. The tiles do not lock, and are obviously hand-sawn with some irregularities. You might have to flatten the bag a bit for it to fit in its compartment; had the tiles been magnetized, this would be difficult.I'm very happy with this edition.

5628,B07ZP8HFNP,R1XSKAB65RDRLS,this math teacher recommends,"  For what it's worth, I have a B.S. in pure mathematics, a fellowship with Math for America, and I've been a high school math teacher since 2000.I see many parents doing flash cards and workbooks with their child and it makes me a little sad. We all want our children to be mathematically proficient because we know how many doors it opens for their future. However, unless your kid loves flash cards and worksheets, I would try to introduce more mathematical play to them. After all, math is as much an art as it is a science and--towards that end--it's important that they see the connections in math. This game allows them to do that, as well as see some of the visual patterns amongst one- and two-digit products.If you like this game and are looking for other math games, I recommend Prime Climb (for ages 7 - 13, but it's fun for adults, too) and Tiny Polka Dots (for ages 2-9).  If you're looking for other board games that have math, but are more game-y than math-y, I strongly recommend Santorini (similar to chess, but my kids like it way more) and Stone Age (great for teaching division; also, just a great board game).",5.0
5629,B07ZP8HFNP,RDL14U9WH3A9G,"Surprisingly fun, challenging, and addictive","  I bought this off the Kickstarter campaign and wasn't sure what to expect.  To my surprise, this game is fantastic.It's essentially tic tac toe meets multiplication, but damn if it's not fun to play.  I was playing against my 12-year-old son and while I dominated him the first two games, it's been really close since then and he's beaten me too.  There's such a great blend of math and strategy.Without a doubt, I ABSOLUTELY FULLY recommend this game.",5.0

The depth of understanding that this game promotes is truly remarkable.The rules are extremely simple, but the gameplay is much more complex than I anticipated. By the middle of the game, I was trying to think 4 and 5 moves ahead. This thought process reinforces the idea that multiplication facts are connected by common factors, which is an essential concept in upper elementary school. I can't think of a better pairing of game logic and math ideas.",5.0

5632,B01KAC6268,R28D9ZL0Z4XFL,Too much fun for one board game,"  Clank is so much fun and quickly rising in the ranks as one of my favorite games.  Is it the deepest, most strategic game out there? No.  Is it the poster child of Eurogame elegance? Absolutely not.  What Clank! offers is a balls out good time at the table, filled with laughs and memorable moments.  Several times in Clank! I'm at the brink of death and in a mad dash to escape the dungeon and get lucky and find that secret heal just in time to get to the top and survive.  Other times it seems like I'll make it without a problem and I get stuck and then the dragon attacks and I'm knocked out before making it out.  These are the kinds of moments that Clank! offers and the game is chock full of them.Clank! is a deck building game where the cards you acquire and play help you move through pathways in a dungeon to collect the best artifact you can and get out before the dragon attacks you enough times to ""knock you out"".  Moving through the dungeon silently is safer but not easy.  Most of the time you're making noise and generating ""Clank!"".  The more Clank! you generate, the more the dragon will target you when it attacks.  The more artifacts the players take, the more enraged the dragon gets and more damage it deals when it attacks.  It's deck building with push your luck elements in a fantasy setting.  Clank! could be a gateway game or perhaps next step after gateway.There are some other deckbuilding games with board elements.  Another one I enjoy is Tyrants of the Underdark.  That one has more strategic decisions, but Clank! is just more fun.  I tend to get bored with many games quickly and want to move on to something new after several plays.  I've played Clank! quite a bit and it's one of the few that I don't see myself burning out on anytime soon.  It's just too much fun.",5.0
5633,B01KAC6268,RJGQLU4M8CBRU,One of the few board games I own that is perfect,"  Your mission is to crawl into the depths of a dungeon and even deeper into the dragons lair and to collect artifacts and other treasures and make it back up and escape before you are killed. This is a victory points game but not in the sense that you need a VP tracker along the board. You just move around the board collecting tokens that reveal something under them when flipped. Move even deeper down the board to find artifacts, the deeper you go, the more valuable the artifact. There are also ways to collect money which you can use to buy things from a market on the board such as keys to unlock certain routes on the board, a backpack that allows you to collect more than one artifact and crowns which are worth a good amount of vp's. Other random loot awaits in the depths such as golden monkey idols!All the while you are doing this you are building up your personal deck of cards. Each player starts with the same 10 cards. You draw 5 cards at the beginning of your turn and play all 5 cards. These cards will, depending on what they are, allow you to move on the board, attack monster cards and gain rewards or even buy more cards for your personal deck! When you buy more cards you add those to your personal discard pile and once you have fully drawn your personal deck you then shuffle your discard pile and start drawing again. Since you only start with 10 cards you will be shuffling that after your second turn. Over time the shuffles become less frequent because you are adding more powerful cards to your deck to be drawn. It's a really cool mechanic and I love it. Also there are SO MANY different cards in this game you will be hardpressed to see them all. They all look great with the artwork and theme.So, the dragon in the room. There are cards that will give you Clank. There are 2 in your opening deck and there are others that give you good bonuses in exchange for you also getting clank. Clank is the noise you make down in the depths whilst treasure hunting. I love how the theme mixes with the cards text as well with all these. For example there is a card called Dead Run that allows to 2 free movement and you can also move through caves, (normally you have to stop movement when you enter a cave). BUT you also have to place 2 clank on the board when you play this card. Which is thematically like, ok so I sprinted very fast through the dungeon but I made alot of noise in doing so. Clank from each player will build up on the board over time until whenever a new card is drawn from the dungeon deck to replace those that have been bought reveals a dragon symbol. When this happens all that clank is taken and placed in a nice suede dragon bag along with a number of black dragon cubes. Then that player draws out a number of cubes based on the dragons rage (starts at 3 cubes I believe). If any match the color of a player, that player takes that amount of damage, if they are the black cubes they are left out of the bag and placed aside.I just love this game. I love how the theme of the game is intertwined throughout every gameplay aspect. I love the fact that there is a doublesided gameboard to change things up a bit with gameplay length and complexity. The amount of different cards and the deckbuilding is great. The little tokens the game comes with are fun and of a good quality. The game doesn't take forever to play but also feels like it takes just the right amount of time and also if a player is killed he still has a job to do which keeps them invested in the game. If a player is killed or the first player to escape puts their player token on a special spot on the top of the board. Everytime there turn comes back around they perform 1 additional dragon attack with added cubes drawn that increase everytime. After ohh like 4 or 5 turns the dragon kills everyone and it's game over. I like this artificial game timer they implemented so players sitting out don't have to wait all night while the rest finish. Also to assuage your fears, you keep whatever treasure and points you collected even if you die, as long as you die above a certain point on the game board. if you die below that point, you lose everything.I cannot recommend this game enough and what's more there are a number of expansions that add totally new gameboards, mechanics and new cards to even further keep this game going long into the future.",5.0
5634,B01KAC6268,R2KHBKR7CFONK0,Do you like Dominion - but wish it included a game board for actions? Try Clank!,"  A deck builder AND a dungeon crawler? Love it!The deck building isn't quite as balanced as Dominion (for example). There are definitely certain cards that you have to buy whenever they come up on the dungeon row. It's not uncommon for one player to get very overpowered in the first few turns, but if your strategy is good you can allow them to settle in to a false sense of security (and hope they travel too deep into the dungeon).I've played it three times now, and like it more each time.The price is a bit high in my opinion, but I would buy again.",5.0
5635,B01KAC6268,R3R49NZACZY5JI,A great family game!,"  This is an ingenious mix of deck building with a dungeon crawl board. My children, 8 and 11, love the game as well. It is fun for the whole family.In the game you use cards to fight monsters, move through the dungeon to get treasures, and buy better cards. As you buy better and better cards your deck gets better. You're in a race to get the best loot on the board. The most expensive loot is further down in the dungeon. As you progress you have cards that tell you that you have made noise (a clank). When this happens you put a colored cube of yours into the clank pile. From time to time a dragon symbol appears on cards and then those cubes are dumped into a bag and drawn from. If your cube is drawn it counts as a wound for you. You need to get out of the dungeon before you are knocked out by too many wounds.",5.0
5636,B01KAC6268,R3PW2YUWA6VJKT,Our first deck builder.  Works well as 2 player game. Great Game!,"  I gave this to my 11.5 year old son for Christmas.  He is a very cautious kid who doesn't like conflict or losing and usually plays cooperative (co-op) games.  He was on the verge of losing interest as I read the rules and went through setup for the first time.  The first few rounds of our first game were a little rough as we referred back to the rules and worked on understanding the mechanics.  We got he hang of it by the fourth round or so and were on our way.We were able to setup our second and later games in just a couple of minutes and without needing to refer to the rulebook.Happily, my son has really enjoyed this game over Christmas break and has asked to play quite often.  We also got my 15 year old daughter to join in the fun.  I thought she would be put off by the graphics and fantasy theme, but she enjoyed it and said she would play again.  Unfortunately, I have yet to win but have come close a couple of times.The game has a decent amount of strategy to it as well as a bit of luck (literally the luck of the draw).  It's also relatively social as we discuss our strategies and make sure we've done everything needed each turn.The build quality is nice.  The Clank bag is of decent quality and is big enough for adults to reach into to pull the cubes.  The cards are a good thickness and aren't flimsy.Other games we enjoy include Pandemic, Takenoko, Sagrada, Carcasonne, Indigo, Forbidden Desert and Forbidden Island.  My wife won't play ""those weird games"" and sticks with Clue and Yahtzee.  The kids also enjoy Twister, Life, and my vintage 80s game Stop Thief.",5.0
5637,B01KAC6268,R236HO4QE3BC0X,Fun but complex - give yourself time!,"  This is a very fun game. I like to describe it as a ""video game in board game form"" because you're collecting treasure, earning money, avoiding dragon attacks, finding keys, watching your ""life,"" etc. Allow 2-3 hours the first time you sit down to learn this game. My husband and I watched several youtube tutorials and it still took time to learn. Also the board setup is extensive and probably takes 20 minutes the first time you do it. But the game is tons of fun and there are three types of ""currency"" on the cards that do different things: movement, fighting, and skills. Then you can use these things to earn coins as a fourth currency, and you can even consider your ""life"" as a fifth currency for some things. So each player can easily have a different strategy. Also, it's not obvious who has won until the end when points are tallied. Also I would say that any child under the age of 12 would have a difficult time playing this unless they were partnered with an adult. It's just very complex and a lot of things to remember. Lots of fun!",5.0
5638,B01KAC6268,R35GMEMWC9J3GF,A simplified Mage Knight meets Super Mario Brothers in a subterranean Candyland.,"  Ranking at the top of current board games that I play with my lovely girlfriend is Clank!For much of its (usual) 60‚Äî75 minute duration, this game is a point salad free for all, but this 360 degree scramble is given some direction in that the board is a dungeon delver and there are a limited number of gettable items.  Add to this a simple deck building mechanism that multiplies possibilities and creates a puzzle, and the resultant game is a unique and fun conflation.  And then there‚Äôs that very fun (and ominous) press-your-luck titular mechanic with the dragon bag, from which cubes (wounds) are drawn.Overall, Clank! is easy to learn and a lot of lighthearted fun....but once somebody exits the dungeon, the countdown to death begins, and the pressure and intensity increase immediately.  Kind of like Mage Knight (simplified) meets Super Mario Brothers in a subterranean Candyland.",4.0
5639,B01KAC6268,R1DO58L3ADV54Z,Really fun game (I am 40),"  I bought this for my 10 year old son for a local ""game night"" at a game store (he wanted to practice and enter tournament).  Really fun game (I am 40).  It requires strategy to build a deck to determine how far to go into the dungeon to steal artifacts from a dragon.  Go in not so far/get out, lower score.  Go farther in, more points/gold, but higher chance of dying before get out.I loved playing with him (takes about an hour to play).  My ex wife HATED it (it goes between houses) b/c ""too complex.""  At the game night, people ages 10-50 were playing it and enjoying it.  I guess they make other versions too (a space one etc).  Anyway, $$$ but I have already played it 4 times with him and neighbor kids (ages 10-13) playing it as well.  Buy some clear sleeves (you will need 200) for the cards and have fun.P.S. My son loves xbox, switch, and ps4 so the fact that he enjoys playing instead of those things is an approval from him.  You just might have to read the directions twice and play slowly the first time to understand it all.",5.0

It results in an interesting if someone complex game that can be a ton of fun.  I'd say my biggest complaints were just how little came in the base game.  I expected more cards and more possibilities, but there are a limit on the cards in the base game, indicating that you'll run into problems with replayability eventually.But its a fine game.

5641,B01KAC6268,R252R6ZYKLH2DN,A Non-Stop Clank! Reviews,"  Clank! Is exactly as described: a deck building dungeon crawl game. The way they capture it is what makes it great. Clank! Has a goofy charm to it. It doesn't take itself too seriously and it's very easy to wrap your head around. Crystal caves end movement. You can teleport, but they do end movement gained by cards with boots. There's plenty of easy to learn/ remember rules and the rule book does a great job of explaining. I was surprised how easy this was to learn and I picked this over Dominion due to the dungeon aspect. Everyone I've introduced to this game like it after their first few turns, and ended yoooo loving it by the time we're running for mystery tokens while others fight for the coveted mastery token. Win or lose I have a good time with Clank! Only downside is if someone dies early in the game. Plays great with any number but be aware of 2 player rules. Would recommend.",5.0
5642,B01KAC6268,R1B0OSBLPG8JU6,Great Game!,"  As far as this seller and all that - Game came exactly as expected and in pristine condition, all good there :)For more of a game review - it's a great game and it's cool that you can play with as few as 2 players, a little bummer that it only plays up to 4 and expansions are new boards not a build for more players. The one other slight disappointment is that I was under the impression that having a two-sided board would extend the playability, but the ""easy"" side is really just to learn on and not really to keep playing with after the first game or two. That said the mechanics make it a fairly different game each time so I don't think playability will be a problem, plus there are a few expansions with new boards. Last critique - not sure if anyone else has this issue but our group found we needed to alter the points of the mastery tokens (to offer higher to first out and lower there after - we've been playing 30, 20, 10, 5) in order to have a more reasonably competitive game.Other than those qualms it's a really fun game and I can definitely recommend it!",5.0

5645,B01KAC6268,RG1NCZBXPO83P,"Clank! is a solid deck builder with a dungeon game board that adds strategy, and clever Clank! and Rage Track mechanics that inc","  There‚Äôs a lot going on in Clank!, which our family played last night for the first time. Spoiler alert: we had a blast, and we will play this again very soon.The GameYou play a dungeon thief, and your goal is to compete with other thieves to delve as deep as you dare into a dungeon to nab artifacts and treasure. The one who gets in, gets the most cool stuff (victory points), and gets out alive, wins the game. However, there is a complication: this dungeon is the lair of a dragon who is none too thrilled about you taking her pretty things. If you make too much noise down there, the dragon will find you and roast your behind. So don‚Äôt make noise, don‚Äôt overstay your welcome, and make sure to have most points at the end of the game to win. That‚Äôs Clank!Starting Deck and ResourcesEach player starts with the same 10 low-level cards. Each card will generate one or more of the following resources:Skill‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääused to acquire new cards to upgrade your deck. Analogous to Ascension‚Äôs Runes or Star Realms‚Äô Trade.Swords‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääused to fight monsters in the Dungeon Row. Just like Ascension‚Äôs Power or Star Realms‚Äô CombatBoots‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääused to move around the dungeon. Closest analogy to my mind are the Expedition Cards that allow you to move across the board in Quest for El Dorado.Dungeon Row and Reserve CardsThe top six cards of the Dungeon Deck are dealt face up to form the Dungeon Row, which is just like Hero Realms‚Äô Market Row, Star Realms‚Äô Trade Row, Ascension‚Äôs Center Row, or the Hogwarts Deck in Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle. You use Skill to purchase upgraded cards from the Dungeon Row, and/or use Swords to vanquish monsters from the Dungeon Row to gain the benefits listed on the Monster card. While purchasing cards from the dungeon/center/market/trade row is a standard feature of all deck builders I‚Äôve played, the ability to fight monsters that appear in the row I have only seen in Ascension.(That said, I haven‚Äôt played either Marvel‚Äôs Legendary or the DC Deck Building game, so for all I know, those games let you beat on bad guys in the center row as well. Let me know in the comments.)The Reserve cards are a row of slightly upgraded cards that are a decent default Skill purchase if you can‚Äôt afford cards in the Dungeon Row. This is most similar to the Mystics, Heavy Infantry and Cultists cards in Ascension. Reserve cards are comprised of Mercenaries who provide Swords (like Heavy Infantry in Ascension), Explore cards which provide Skill and Boots, Secret Tomes that provide victory points at the end of the game (but nothing else, thus cluttering up your deck during play), and the ever-present Goblin that you can always fight if there are no more interesting/attractive opponents in the Dungeon Row (reminiscent of the Cultists in Ascension).The Game BoardHere‚Äôs where Clank! starts to differentiate itself from other deck builders. It has a game board that represents your path down into the dragon‚Äôs dungeon. The only other deck builder I‚Äôve played with a game board is Quest for El Dorado. The game board really does add extra strategy to the game. Do you take a direct path to a single chosen Artifact, then hightail it out of there as fast as possible? Or do you burgle as many rooms as possible, earn enough gold to buy a backpack or two, and spend extra time collecting multiple Artifacts, even though this exposes you to more time underground, and greater risk of death by dragon attack?While the Artifacts are placed in designated rooms (the further from the entrance and harder to reach, the higher value the Artifact), the Major and Minor Treasures are randomly assigned to rooms at the start of each game. This adds an element of randomness that increases the game‚Äôs replay value, since players won‚Äôt know where the more valuable treasures are located in a given game session.Also on the game board: health counters for 1‚Äì4 players (similar to Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle), the Clank! cube area, and a mechanic called the Rage Track.The Clank Cubes, Dragon Bag, and Rage TrackThe eponymous and clever Clank! mechanism is what makes the game unique. Each player has a set of Clank! cubes. When you draw Stumble cards into your hand, or when other players tattle on you, or play other cards with that increase the noise you make‚Ä¶you must add one or more of your player-color Clank! cubes to the Clank! area. The more noise you make, the more time you spend in the dragon‚Äôs lair, the more of your color Clank! cubes will accumulate in that Clank! area.When a card with a Dragon Attacks! symbol is drawn from the Dungeon Deck, the dragon‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääum‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääattacks. When this happens, all players‚Äô cubes in the Clank! area are placed inside the Dragon Bag that Renegade Studios thoughtfully included in the box, unlike some other game companies (*cough* FFG *cough* Arkham Horror: The Card Game), and players draw the number of cubes indicated by the dragon‚Äôs current position on the Rage Track. The Rage Track mechanic reminds me of the Infection Rate in Pandemic, or the water level meter in Forbidden Island, in that game events cause the track to gradually advance, which increases the likelihood that one or more players will get damaged or knocked out by dragon attacks. The Rage Track really ratchets up tension as the game progresses.In the early game, the Dragon Bag is filled with more black (neutral) cubes than player-color cubes, which means there is a lower probability of a player‚Äôs cube being pulled and that player suffering damage. But here‚Äôs the clever bit: as they are pulled from the bag, those neutral cubes are set aside. As the game goes on and players make more noise, more player cubes are added to the Dragon Bag. The more time you spend in the dragon‚Äôs lair, the greater the chance that you will be roasted by dragon‚Äôs breath. It‚Äôs a genius mechanic that, along with the steadily advancing Rage Track, amp up your sense of urgency to achieve your objective and get the heck out of Dodge, fast!ImpressionsWhen a game tries to implement too many different mechanics, there‚Äôs potential for creating an over-complicated, bloated mess that‚Äôs hard to teach and takes forever to play. This is even more true of deck builders, whose primary appeal is pick-up-and-play simplicity. There‚Äôs a reason why Ascension (2010) and Star Realms (2014) remain popular years later: accessibility and direct, no-nonsense playability.Which makes it even more impressive that Clank! harmoniously blends all of these elements into a light, brisk-playing, family-weight package with enough crunchy strategy and variability to keep more ‚Äúserious‚Äù gamers entertained as well.At its core, Clank! is a very good deck builder. The Dungeon cards provide a wide variety of upgrade options to purchase, challenging monsters to conquer, and treasures to collect. The card special abilities provide meaningful in-game benefits (or penalties!). Unlike the base game of Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle, Clank! thoughtfully provides cards that allow you to cull unwanted cards from your deck.On top of this strong deck builder foundation, they added a double-sided (easy map on one side, harder on the other) game board with the brilliant Rage Track and Clank! Area mechanics, for a sense of pulse-pounding tension that rivals the Doom Track in FFG‚Äôs Eldritch Horror. The paths on the game board require strategy and planning to navigate, tempting you to press your luck while simultaneously managing your health level, treasures, and likelihood that you‚Äôll make it out alive to enjoy the spoils of your labors.Earlier I compared Clank! to Reiner Knizia‚Äôs Quest for El Dorado, which was a nominee for 2017 Spiel des Jahres. As good as that game is, Clank! is better. It is more ambitious, and succeeds at most of what it tries to do.Bottom line: Clank! is a solid deck builder with a dungeon game board that adds strategy, and clever Clank! and Rage Track mechanics that increase tension and fun. I can‚Äôt wait to try the 2017 follow up, Clank! In! Space!",5.0

A couple months later I finally bought the game and haven't regretted it since.I've played Yugioh in high school so I was drawn to deck builders and love the press your luck element. It's easy to teach new gamers and although games can seem a bit drawn out, its always a bunch of fun. Every game is different and requires a different strategy depending on what other players do. Regardless of your situation, winning or losing you always have a chance to come back or at the very least screw over your opponents. Pulling clank (the noise you make) for a dragon attack is tense and exciting, sometimes your risky plays pay off or ends up killing you in the end.

My main concern with these miniatures was whether or not they are comparable in size and quality to the prepainted figures purchased in booster packs. Not only are these miniatures true to 25mm scale, but the weight of the plastic and quality of sculpt are eye catching.I'm impressed with these miniatures enough to collect each board game as I have the funds to. Legend of Drizzt in particular has several drow miniatures which tend to be pricey when purchased alone, and there are several in this set. Coolest of all are the Balor and Jarlaxle figures. Now I have a Jarlaxle miniature--just in time for the Waterdeep Dragon Heist campaign my DM will be running.Highly recommended, even if only to expand your miniatures collection!",5.0
5663,0786958731,R3TQB4AGV9S6GE,A fantastic bargain for the miniatures alone! The game itself is a bonus to me!,"  A fantastic purchase. 40 Miniatures for just under 50 dollars is a steal anywhere, and because the box is themed, I can run a RPG campaign outside of the board game. The game itself is easy to pick up, a great way to introduce curious gamers to the RPG world, though there is little imagination left up to the players.The game is not played like a traditional RPG, there is no DM, everyone is both their character and draws traps and enemies from a deck for the whole group to face on their individual turns. A little confusing but probably easier to grasp for people who have never played a traditional RPG.",5.0
5664,0786958731,R1G3HXL41TPUK9,Could be so much more,"  My background is in '80s AD&D, and that's the only game system I've had any real experience with.  It's the most flexible-I don't see a reason to have ever changed it.  I realize this will come out biased, but I wish these board games involved a little more of that game system.  I have only played this once, and I played the solo adventure with Drizzt.What I don't like about the system used here is it soon becomes fairly tedious.  Battles are boring.  I'm trying to imaging playing this with three or four players to speculate if that would add a sense of excitement; I doubt it.  Every creature I've faced has either one or two hit points.  Essentially, if you hit them, they are dead.  I'm certain there are a few monsters that are tougher, that one would meet in the multi-player scenarios the game has.The problem for me is that hit points, AC, to hit, damage, etc. is all worked out beforehand and the only required die is a D20.  There are no damage rolls.  Surely, adding the uncertainty of damage rolls (and larger hit point totals) would increase the excitement of the battles.  A simple enough system can be worked out that would allow for this.Hand in hand with the battle boredom is the fact that players can only level up once...ever...if that.  What has to happen is that you need to have 5 experience points worth of cards in your possession when you happen to roll a natural 20.  If that happens for you, then you can turn in your 5 experience points and go up a level which increases your stats minimally.It wouldn't be difficult to create a chart that lays out an adjustment for monsters based on aggregate party level, and allow characters to level up more frequently.  Leveling up is a type of reward, and it adds motivation and excitement to the game.  So does rolling more than a single D20 all game.  How about a D4, D6, D8 and D10 at least.  It would add some variety and intrigue.I understand the whole thing needs to be contained within the confines of a board game.  But, with all the reference material in existence, it would be easy to make more out of these board games.Lastly, I'll say that for the price ($50) it comes with lots of cool (albeit plastic) monster figurines, and the tile-based dungeon system is pretty good.  If they wanted, they could ""modulize"" these games by releasing a basic set which contains rulebook, dice, figures, generic cut-outs, etc. and then release modules consisting of specific figures, storybooks, dungeon tiles.  They could sell these modules for half the price.",3.0
5665,0786958731,R2E7L1WFW6GTCW,A great rules lite D&D hack n' slash game. No DM required,"  This is my first purchase into the D&D Adventure board game system. It is a tile based hack n' slash that focuses on combat and exploration. This version has all the main characters from the Drizzt books and does a great job in translating each characters unique abilities. There is a lot replay ability, the ability to incorporate the other games into it, as well as plenty of room to make up your own house rules and custom adventures. BGG has a lot of resources for opening the game up to more content. Plays well with a group as well as solo. One of the best dungeon crawl board games I have.",5.0
5666,0786958731,RWJ2Q346QXI2L,This game is a hack and slash dungeon crawler,"  I have really gotten into solo gaming the last year and I have been looking for a good D&D type game.  The Legend of Drizzt does not create an immersive RPG environment but it does a decent job of capturing a D&D feel.  This game is a hack and slash dungeon crawler.  I have enjoyed the best playing solo; I found playing it with multiple people was a little tedious as the turns dragged on.  I think a dungeon crawler should be fast-paced and the best way to accomplish that is to play solo.  Still, it is a nice introduction to the D&D world for my kids and it is a step up from Dungeon the board game.  We have the newer version of Dungeon which has Forgotten Realms characters.  My son enjoyed seeing these characters in this game.The miniatures are very good.  I only occasionally paint minis, but I am looking forward to painting these.  I enjoy the Drizzt books so playing through the scenarios as they loosely follow the books is fun.  Also, playing as Jarlaxle is pretty cool.This is the first game I have picked up in this series.  I plan on getting more for sure.",4.0
5667,0786958731,R1C7869SNCK1R2,"Great minis, great game flow, little downtime and interesting monster AI system","  I no longer own my copy of this because I was going through a phase where I wrote it off as too simple or repetitive, but I didn't delve very deep into the content, didn't play all the characters, didn't try all their ability options, etc.I've got one of the newer D&D Adventure System games (Dungeon of the Made Mage) and have yet to play it, but it does have me wondering if I may end up picking up my original intro to the series, Drizzt. I've never played the Ravenloft or Ashardalon boxes, but the consensus seems to be that of the original 3 games Drizzt was the winner in terms of interesting content, characters, minis, etc.It plays very quickly once you know the rules - which are conveniently [slightly] derived from D&D/D20. This could make it a gateway game for introducing players to the [significantly deeper, more complex, narratively/emotionally richer, but also inherently fuzzier and rules lawyer-inducing] world of D&D and other tabletop RPGs. It can also serve as a toned-down echo of a true D&D experience for players who can't/don't feel up to playing a real session of the ""granddaddy of all RPGs"" game, which certainly can involve a lot more commitment, effort, and heartbreak, not to mention serious arguments and infighting. Unlike the big bro game, the Adventure System games don't require a Dungeon Master! This is a huge selling point in terms of overall commitment, and specifically the need for someone to be in charge of creating an ongoing world for the players to navigate, fresh non-player characters to talk to, etc. These games are co-op, with all players winning or losing as a team. They can also be played solo, which is a big draw for some of us shut-ins and folks who can't regularly manage to find a playgroup.The rules include some rather smart solutions to common problems in other dungeon-crawler/tactics games: Players can just sit and wait for enemies to spawn and kill them for loot endlessly, and players have no serious time limits/urgent drive to explore and accomplish tasks. In these rules, if you don't explore, adding a new tile during your turn, you must draw an event card, which tends to be a Bad Thing, usually traps. Exploring a new tile, however, always results in adding a new monster, which adds additional complexity and risk to manage itself. It's the main recurring trade-off in the game, event card, or new monster. It's always some fresh hell, in either case, rest assured. Exploring new tiles is also the only way to reach whatever your current scenario's objective is, whether that's killing a Big Bad in its lair, recovering a precious treasure, or similar.The game is a good time, and it can result in some great memories made with your group. Helping one another not only by contributing via your hero's actions, but discussing tactical options and general ongoing strategy can be both crucial and one of the best parts about the game.",4.0
5668,0786958731,RBM8H67UF1YRO,Fun Game with Good Mini for D&D,"  This is the 3rd D&D Board game I have purchased, I previously bought Wrath of Ashardolon and Castle Ravenloft. I purchased all of them for around $40. I originally bought these for the miniatures so I could use them in my D&D game. What I found was that my kids really enjoy playing the D&D board games (7 yr old and 17 yr old) together as a family. Also my D&D group will play one of these if we end up short a player or two as alternative. This board game is based on the Drizzt novels so if you are big fan of those it is a definite plus.The boxes are heavy duty and have nice cover art. All the figures came in good shape though I there are a some floppy swords but that is really common with minis. At $40 for $40 miniatures it is a great deal. While the figures aren't top of the line you are only paying $1/each so you get a lot of value. With this set you get several larger figures such as 2 trolls, a drider (half spider half man), a dragon and a huge demon. Some of the sculptures are really nice.",5.0
5669,0786958731,R3C3VWSE07R46Z,Great for father-child bonding!,"  I won't attempt to review this game in total, or go over the rules, as this has been done effectively many times before. I wanted to review it, however, as an experience for playing with young children.Summary - 5/5I have 2 kids, one 4 one 6.5. This game is excellent for introducing children 6+ to gaming concepts, and enjoying some quality time together. I would not recommend it as a first game, but once your kids have some basic ideas of gameplay, its cooperative nature offers a perfect blend of progressively independent action and bonding.Theme and appeal - 5/5The theme and appeal of the game is obvious. By the age of 3 or 4 most children will have been bombarded with a variety of fantasy narratives, and enjoy them. Spooky dungeons. Scary dragons. Heroic knights. While some parents may be concerned at the idea of crawling through caves and killing monsters, my personal view is that this comes very naturally to kids these days, and is in fact quite empowering - see a monster, whammo! blast it with a magic wand.This game creates a very tactile upfront experience of the things they have seen on TV or in story books. The little miniatures are very appealing, both to my 3 (almost 4) year old girl, and to my 6.5 year old son.Is it kid proof - 3/5This game is sturdy and durable. You will, however, need to keep a close eye on all the bits, which can be easily lost if not kept in themed baggies, and without very clear 'putting away when used' rules.The miniatures can probably take some abuse, but also need some care as there are bits that could be snapped off. You will also need to be disciplined with the cards. When my son gets excited, he waves his arms and is sometimes tempted to squish them inside his hands.Assuming you play on the floor (which I do) you may also need to make clear no walking or rolling over the board rules...Can a 6/7 year old contribute meaningfully, and feel fulfilled? - 4/5Most certainly, but with guidance. Even a three year old can choose which corner of a new tile to explore, and count out spaces (although it helps if they have learned space counting in other games first). A 6/7 year old can choose which powers they want to use, although may need some tactical/strategic guidance.I found the game offered plenty to make my son feel very fulfilled playing the game. We died in our first adventure, but despite this setback he was delighted to recall some of his more heroic moments, and how if we had only done this or that we might just have made it.Can Dad enjoy it while playing with the kids? - 5/5Certainly he can. One way to view it is as solo plus, in which you still may have to make a majority of the strategic decisions - which (despite some complaints about the game being too easy) are not always simple - but you also get the pleasure in sharing the experience with others.You can also use the game to practice your story telling skills to a sometimes quite demanding audience!Is it educational? - 5/5OK, let's be clear up front that this is not going to enhance your child's understanding of world geography, or the way plants grow. It is fantasy.But first up, I consider fantasy to be an important part of human culture, and one of the shared experiences that bind society together.Beyond that, the game teaches social play. Teamwork. Tactical and strategic decision making. Logic. (If-then, if not-then something else). Basic AI. Planning. It encourages reading, and thinking about maths and probability. It teaches rule systems, and how to best use them to your advantage. What's not to love about this, especially in an era of electronic solitude?Is it easy to learn/teach? - 4/5Again, this puts a certain amount of onus on the parent. I highly doubt your 6.5 year old will be able to read and understand the rules without guidance.I made the mistake of trying a first game without understanding everything myself, and my poor son was stuck watching me sweat my way through the rules (as can be seen from another posting I made). It might be a good idea to do a solo run first.But once you get the basic concepts (how monsters move!), it comes quite easily. Yes, you do need to explain how the powers work. How the exploration works. How the monsters work. It is a lot to absorb at first.But if your kid is interested, they will pay attention, and it can be revealed progressively through gameplay.I am also amazed how much space a 6/7 year old has in his/her brain to absorb new rules... more than once I've opened an old card game and asked - hmm, how many do we deal to start? - only to have my son answer for me...Does it play out reasonably quickly? - 4/5I am assuming, with this score, that you know that you are in for a substantial game. i.e. This is not a ten minute frisson. The question is whether it can keep a kid's attention or not.In my first game, I found myself wishing it would take a little less time. Not a lot less, but right at the end - when it went past bedtime, and was starting to drag a little.That said, the denouement came roughly about the time I expected, and my son's attention was pretty gripped (allowing for a couple of short breaks). And there would be no harm in tweaking the game a bit... one or two fewer tiles, perhaps, before the final boss, could be one approach.Is it fun? - 5/5Yes! Its theme, fairly simple gameplay, and balance of achievement and challenge works well for kids. Everyone loves receiving a treasure. Everyone hates getting a nasty encounter.Great game. And given it is a system more than a game, with a lot of variety, I hope to be playing this for quite some time.",5.0
5670,0786958731,R3IVC18SI8GQ55,Diet DnD,"  Wish they had this when I got tired of actual dnd when I was a teenager. It is perfect for beginners or ppl who love board games but HATE dnd. I like actual DnD so that is why 3 stars. It is mainly for co/op and epic battles without the lore and adventure aspect of DnD. It is a very light dungeon crawler even compared to Massive Darkness, Zombicide, pretty much the lighest dungeon crawler ever. You level up once but you get really cool minis which makes this a great value. I would pass on this if you play DnD, or any dungeon crawler. It says you can play solo but it isn't the greatest in fact it's boring...but if you play with others damn you can have some amazing battles because you start strong but so do the enemies so it is just all out war sometimes and that is fun with a group. ppl into warband or pvp type games will really like this game. If you want adventure and lore with rich story for days then pass and get a DnD starter set. but if you think lore is lame and just want to KILL TROLLZ!!! this is your game.",3.0

The minis alone justify the price if you pick it up for $40. I only give it three stars because the character balance is by far the worst of any of the D&D boardgames. Drizzt is incredibly overpowered and can take the challenge away from the game. That said it's still a great pick up if you own the other a as the characters are interchangeable.,3.0

There are monsters, bad guys, good guys, twists, turns, and surprises. The best part is that everyone joins forces against the game so everyone wins or loses together. It also allows excellent solo play for when you don't have much time or can't find a convenient opponent. Great playability and great components.",5.0
5673,0786958731,R3KQPIZETRW1I8,Great game! WORTH the money.,"  This is without a doubt one of the most addicting and entertaining board games I've ever played. My boyfriend and I frequently play board games together, and oftentimes we meet with another couple for dinner and game night. On nights like that, this game is perfect.I have no experience with tabletop RPGs, but fortunately, the rules are very straightforward. There are some rare instances where the rulebook isn't clear, so sometimes you will have to decide for yourself how to respond in those situations. The game play is fluid, and there are multiple ways that you can play the game, which means that the fun is always a bit different.There are TONS of pieces, so it helps to find a good system for organizing them all. The game is relatively quick too! Most games last between 30 and 45 minutes, BUT the setup takes about 10 to 15 minutes. It's almost not worth it to dig out all the pieces if you're only going to play one game, simply because it takes a minute to get everything situated. Typically we play 2 or 3 games back to back while we have everything laid out.You do need ALOT of space to play as well. Usually we just play in the floor, that way we can build the dungeon without fear of running out of room.Overall, it's a great game. I love it, and I'll definitely be purchasing Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft. I would recommend starting with Legend of Drizzt, because it is very...beginner friendly.",5.0
5674,0786958731,RB348RA6E2YXU,"Fun game, and a nice introduction to D&D for non-D&D players!","  I bought this as a game for my non-D&D family to learn to play.  I would highly recommend it for an all-ages group with minimal experience with RPGs.  The game has 13 scenarios, all of which follow Drizzt's history, from his escape from the Underdark up to Gauntlgrym.  The first 4 adventures teach players how to play the game, and the very first adventure is a solo one, designed to teach the turn overview.  My family played this, with each person taking a turn at taking a turn.  The board consists of tiles, and as the player moves, it's possible to place tiles in a variety of directions.This keeps the game fresh.My group of newbies started to notice how seamlessly the different stages of the turn flowed.  Turn speed increased, and it was apparent that it should be possible to complete the game in short order, once everyone knows how to play.One caveat: It took us quite a few minutes to realize that there were several board tiles underneath the plastic game tray in the box.

As a Game Master (GM), I really like these board games as a time for me to play/learn tactics.  The rules of the game act as the GM so I can play with family or friends or even by myself.  Note: because of the mechanics of the game, the story building is virtually non-existent but is pre-determined by the game itself.

For comparison, the Castle Ravenloft game was certainly thematic and brought back some fond memories roleplaying in the demiplane of dread; but it's not quite the same as participating in a dungeon crawl as Bruenor, Cattie Brie, or any of of the other the iconic companions.  If you are on the fence about which cooperative game to purchase from WotC, the Legend of Drizzt might be the best option, since basically all these games are the same but it's more likely one of your friends has at least heard about the most famous drow, helping to enrich the experience.",5.0

The rule book is a little vague however there are several YouTube videos of people playing this game that lends itself to insturcting the viewers to the finer points of the game.  There is also a scenario book to set up adventures and quests to undertake in the gameThe game itself is quite something to behold.  Numerous tiles make up the ""board"" that is used as the dungeon layout.  There many miniatures that are representative of your heroes and foes to be encountered and slain along the way.

It took a few rounds but it was very easy to catch on to the game play.  It was nice that a DM is not needed.  Every one gets to play.  The game comes with a 10 good scenarios that can be played out in about 2 hours.  Some were so good we played them again and just switched up characters.  The game comes with a nice selection of miniatures.  You get your money back on those alone.  The map system is interlocking squares that you put together at random.  So every time you play its a new map.  Also great for building your own maps.My only negative about this is some characters just seem a bit over powered.  With some of the treasure items there is only a 1 in 10 chance of missing your target.After playing this I kept my eyes out for Wrath of Ashardalon, and Castle Ravenloft.  I have played some Wrath and wished I had started with that one first.  All 3  can be mixed together if you choose.

Similar to Dungeons Explorer and Mage Knights,"  This board game will be easier for those who had played the RPG D&D before, The idea is similar where the heroes(you) goes into the dungeon and battle monsters. A random tile will be selected and added to the board as the Hero explores the ""dungeon."" A new monster will appear with each new tile. It can be challenging if the heroes starts flipping more tiles and made more than one monster appear at a time. You roll on behalf of the monster and yourself in a battle, so if you are bad with dice, then the monster would share your good share of roll too.You will have to pay attention to the powers and items that your Hero has and this could be the like it or hate it thing for people who never played any D&D before. You will have at least 6 cards that you can choose from for your Hero each time it goes into battle and being familiar with them can be hard for new players.Overall, it is a fun game.

It does remove the campaign mode but there is plenty of official and unofficial content online as well as the ability to create your own adventure.Those familiar with the Drizzt books will recognize some of the scenario stories in the game but it is not necessary to know the story to enjoy this game. Definitely recommend if you enjoyed the previous games or just want to try the D&D board games for the first time. There is a mix of luck (random card draws, tile draws, and dice rolls) but there is also a bit of tactical and teamwork play to help balance it out as well.",5.0

The little figures are great. This is one of 3 box sets in this series and me and two friends each bought one so when we get together all the monsters/characters/spells/items can pretty easily be used across all 3 games so you can triple your choices if you get bored eventually with one set. Great for beginning D&D players to get a feel for how everything works, and even experienced D&D people can enjoy the cool figures and the time that went into making these games pretty great and semi intuitive.",5.0

Another fun part of this game is to make up new rules and different ways to play - like backwards from 100 to 1 and climb down the ladders and slide up the chutes!!  Or, if you play in the normal sequence but get within 6 at the end - and spin a higher number that what you need you simply go around past 100 and come back along the top two rows again.  Has been fun even as we play over and over!  Our 3 year old has enough patience  to spin for someone else too. Fun!",5.0
5705,B00V82MG2O,R2I06SPIJPWR71,Looks like the original,"  Looks just like the original/ old school version. BUT they made a HUGE improvement on the structure of the box. There's an insert in the box that creates a storage space for the pieces, so they can be stored in the box with the lid closed all the way while they're still together, under the game board. The actual original game didn't have this, so we couldn't store the pieces in the bases under the board. All my 80's kids peeps will know what I'm talking about with the original. ;)",5.0
5706,B00V82MG2O,R36KHC74UNF7Y6,Beautiful game and the box is good quality!,"  I was so excited to get this for my 5 year old and I, since we are on lock down. I played this game relentlessly as a kid in the 90s, and I live that it teaches counting to 100, action and consequence, and right and wrong (for example, one kid gets into the cookie jar and then it breaks, sending him down the slide) or how a little girl plants her garden and then gets to go up the ladder and has a beautiful bouquet as a result of her hard work! its a very non-religious way to hhelp teach pre-k kids and older how to take turns, make good decisions and be helpful. And it's good quality!

5707,B00V82MG2O,R17W8DAFRZFPSH,Too Dated,"  I loved this game as a child. Unfortunately my 4.5 year old did not enjoy it that much. He had some trouble remembering the direction his piece should move as it is all squares on top of each other. Arrows point the direction but he didn't always pick up on them. He got bored with this game, and didn't like sliding backwards because he did "" something"" bad. In retrospect, some of the "" bad""  and "" good""  choices are extremely dated on this game from a more contemporary child development perspective. I found my self explaining how eating cookies wasn't a bad choice as long as you had permission. Etc. Wish I had purchased a revised edition.",3.0

I remember playing this when I was a kid, and it's a cute game that generally goes fairly quickly to keep everyone's attention span while spending time together and not leaving anyone feeling left out or bored out of their minds.I do wish it had more playing pieces.

This game is very boring and too young for my kids. The tasks on the game are too ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and there is no competition or ‚Äúgame strategy‚Äù.

5738,B074P7T3LS,R1YFCV5WLTJHMK,Love this game,"  My 5.5 and 3.5 year olds love this game.  It is cooperative (everyone wins), and that seems to be the best type of game to prevent meltdowns in my family.  Some of the gameplay seems too simple to be fun (think of an animal and say what sound it makes, or say a yummy food), but it is actually challenging for my 3.5 year old to come up with options, and it is really cute to see what kids come up with.  The part where you're acting out a picture on a card (like charades), is our favorite part of the game, but it has taken several games for our youngest to understand that she can't tell us what she is acting out.  I didn't have super high hopes for this game, but it is the one my kids are asking to play most often these days.",5.0

My 4yo really loves this game, but I'm afraid it teaches kids the whole participation trophy thing. Nobody wins or loses and there really isn't any element of competition.

You just name a word,  food, or animal to get a cup cake.  And if you land on the present you pick a card and play charades for 2 cupcakes.  Pretty much anything you do you get a cupcake...

She got it a week ago for Christmas and the first thing she asks every morning is ‚ÄúCan we play Pete the Cat game?‚ÄùI love that it‚Äôs cooperative so all players win and there‚Äôs no way to really loose. All the activities are so fun too! So much better than just grabbing a card or spinning a spinner and advancing towards a finish line,5.0
5764,B0813WY7V8,R3BBEM5FRF2GAL,Fantastic documentary,"  All in all, I really enjoyed the documentary and would thoroughly recommend it.As an avid tabletop game player & designer I loved the wide range of personalities interviewed throughout, however a lot of the interviews were a bit superficial as they barely scratched the surface.

Played with kids 7, 10 & 11 and they all loved it. They've just recently outgrown Sleeping Queens that we've played to death. Dragonwood is the perfect next step up. Thank you Gamewright! There's a reason l have almost all of their games. They know what they're doing in game design. The dice are gorgeous, the card art is great. You really feel like you're walking through a magical wood capturing spooky spiders, finding enchantments and battling a fierce blue dragon.",5.0
5770,B00UB7OV7K,R1W1JTMWSJ7QKT,Great game for little adventurers.,"  Our boys received Dragonwood, Dungeon, and Pathfinder as Christmas gifts.  They are 4, 6, 8, & 16.  Our family loves board games and we really wanted to encourage their storytelling skills and imagination.  This game was very easy to learn and teach to each of the boys.  Although the 4 year old played on my team, he would make up a story to go wit each attempt to capture.  Although we used the words capture, the boys eventually told stories that went beyond just capturing the characters on the card.  We also named each of the  cards a special name of their own - The Enchantress, The Wizard, the Dark Knight, The Light Night, & The Elf.  It made for consistency across the stories being told by each boy on his turn.  The pictures are fantastically illustrated and the cards have a very nice feel.I did notice that another review complained about the directions for this game.  I found the directions very clear and well illustrated.  Our boys who are all solid readers, still preferred to reference the picture in the directions of what constitutes a Strike, Stomp, or a Scream.  Once we had the basic directions down, we added the bit about telling a story to coincide with the cards being played and acted upon and we had played 3 games before bedtime just that first night.  When I came home from work today, I found that the boys had been playing this game all morning on their own!  This is a really fun game.",5.0
5771,B00UB7OV7K,R2KV8XBBEGLSE7,Family fun!,"  We have had Sleeping Queens for a while and the whole family loves it. This is a great step up for a family wanting a slightly more involved game. Easy to learn and understand, and it comes with two reference cards to remind you of your play options each turn which was helpful for the kids. My 6 and 9 year old both loved it!",5.0
5772,B00UB7OV7K,R2PW0UADA8M0RE,Great Math Mechanics,"  This a fantastic early elementary level math/probability/push your luck game. The premise is simple: Choose a monster card you want to capture.  You can theb play one to six cards of the same number, in a run, or in a flush. You then roll dice equal to the number of cards played. You then total the Dice and compare it to the monster card. Equal to or higher wins you the card.  It's simple enough for my six year old to play (with help from me) against my wife, and it clearly is teaching her the basics theories of probability and early ideas of ""push your luck"" versus ""play it safe strategies.""  Once she has another year of school down, she should have no problem playing it on her own against us.  Oh, and my wife wanted to play it with me once the kids were in bed as a nice light distraction game!  A huge A++ for quality math based mechanics, with another + thrown in for cute art.",5.0
5773,B00UB7OV7K,R19XZHZIMZRHK9,Great game for those growing out the of the little kid stuff.,"  My 9 year old son bought this game after playing it at church. The pastor's kids brought it one Sunday and they played it in lieu of Sunday school (clutch your pearls everyone!! lol). It's a fun game that gives the feeling of daring and challenge combined with strategy, but easy enough that you don't have to be a perfect strategist to do well. My kids are 6, 7 and 9 and they can all play it. I was actually surprised by how quickly they caught on to the complexities, but they also play Minecraft and other strategy games so they're used to this sort of thing. This is a great game for ""inbetweeners"" that are too old for Candy Land and too young for Risk. For them it feels like a ""grown up"" game, but it's well designed for young minds. For the educational minded, this game is good for math skills as well as logic and reasoning. It also encourages long term planning if you want to do well when a dragon strikes! My oldest quickly figured out to save a great hand to be ready for a dragon.The only reason I don't give it five stars is that once you get going it's rather redundant. You're pretty much doing the same thing again and again. But for kids it's fine. As an adult it gets old.  ;)",4.0
5774,B00UB7OV7K,R1DICNH0GXIJVJ,Much needed break from the WiiU,"  My two boys, 8 and 10, loved this game. They were worried that it would be too nerdy for them but ended up completely obsessed very quickly. I was so happy something got them away from video games!",5.0
5775,B00UB7OV7K,R1LSAN98XR37HF,Beautiful and fun addition to homeschool game library,"  My 7 yr old son and I just received this game and have played it twice already.  He needs a little help to get through it, but he loves the game already.  He is fascinated with the artwork and creatures enough to be trying to read and quickly add up the dice on his own.  He is a fairly reluctant reader and usually avoids reading even simple things so I am delighted this has caught his attention enough to make him excited to read and quickly add as well as think critically about the simple strategy.  As a homeschool family, we are always on the lookout for fun games that reinforce concepts we are learning and this fits the bill! (Having 6 dice makes for great math).  The game is really lovely and simple enough to play enjoyably from the start.",5.0
5776,B00UB7OV7K,R7XZ7RHZUCK3Q,Great Strategy & Fun for Family & Friends Alike!,"  After playing Dragonwood over 30 times in the first week, I think it is safe to post a review.  First of all, this game is extremely easy to learn from the instruction manual, and even easier to teach others how to play.  I have played this game with my wife, my two sons (11 & 9), and 3 other friends who are into strategy games.  It is so easy to pick up and play.  It is a good mix of deck building, random dice rolling and strategy.  It stays fresh enough that you can keep playing, without boring, at least for 2-3 times in a setting.  The art style is simple and elegant, and a great attraction to anyone who is into medieval style.  The game experience is equally fun for 2-4 players.  The instructions include 2-3 variants as well for more experienced players.  I have not attempted those yet but look forward to doing that soon.",5.0
5777,B00UB7OV7K,RVJ286SNQMG24,Slow going and unbalanced,"  You will note in the photo I have included that the Hungry Bears, Pack of Wolves, Wild Boar and Fierce Jaguar are all worth 3 victory points.  Capturing these however, is different for each.  The 'strike' method of capture has 3 different amounts; 1 is 6 1 is 7 and 2 are 8 to capture.  For the 'Stomp"" method they have two amounts; 2 have 7 and 2 have 6.  Finally for the 'Scream"" method there are again three amounts, 7, 8 and 9.The three methods of capture, scream, strike and stomp all have the same odds of being gathered in the needed order to use them.  The amounts needed to capture should be based on the VP of the card in question not randomly selected per card.  This would allow for a balanced game.Next, for the level of this game, the game play is rather slow.  We got so bored in the first game that we lost interest and did not complete the first game.  A game this simple should be much faster paced, the Lucky Ladybugs are an attempt to do this and while they do add a bit of speed to the game it is still slow.In short, I was hopeful that this would be a good fast or at least quick game that could be used to entertain and teach on a lazy afternoon and used as an alternative to electronic entertainment.  It failed at a very slow pace that was grueling and not fun.  We were disappointed.",2.0
5778,B00UB7OV7K,R55G8RI79L49A,It's a huge hit in the house.,"  My GOSH my 7 year old son is obsessed with this game. We recently (in the last several months) became a major gamer family. It's a way to bond with my 4 and 7 year old sons. This is one of many games I purchased and by far the one that is most played. Now, for me personally - I can get bored with this one. But it is just right for my 7 year old. My 4 year old also plays but I often need to remind him of sequences for the 3 methods of attack. He tends to use the ""Scream"" most of all because it's easier for him to remember to use the same color. But he still has a lot of fun. This game can go on for a LONG time too. I have gotten to the point I remove many cards out of the event deck so we have a shorter play time.The dice are lovely red and smooth. The card artwork is pretty. The entire box and set up is well made and just nice quality. We've definitely played our money's worth out of it already.",5.0
5779,B00UB7OV7K,R3HX7I5LG2L0IO,Good game but very easy - with default rules,"  The first several tries this game was very fun, but we soon learned to draw cards until we had enough for a 6 card Strike. Once you have that, you can breeze through the whole Creature deck with no resistance... making the game so easy it isn't really fun anymore. However, with a couple minor rule changes it can be challenging and fun again.1. Don't end the game when both dragons are captured, play through the whole deck.2. Don't use all 6 dice for normal capture attacks. Use only 4, with exceptions for the single-use Enhancement cards that act as an extra card or dice. This makes capturing upper level creatures difficult and requires players to use the different capture methods and Enhancements.With those minor fixes to the rules, this game is fantastic for kids and adults. Highly recommended!",4.0
5780,B00UB7OV7K,R22HS9EVMBOJ2M,"Strategy, chance and dragons!","  Gamewright makes a lot of cool games. As my boy gets older, I like to get games with more complexity and strategy. (Can‚Äôt wait until he‚Äôs 10 so I can get Forbidden Island!) Dragonwood is super! We received it two days ago and have already played it several times. A friend of mine (an adult) and I just played it. She took a photo of the box because she wants to get it for herself. I would suggest to the company that rather than strike, stomp or scream, they change it to strike, shoot (with an arrow) or cast spell. After all, the cards have swordspeople, archers and sorcerers. Nobody has heavy boots that we can see, and no one looks angry, so why all the stomping and screaming? This is where house rules come in. Great game! Oh, and nice box, too. :)",5.0
5781,B00UB7OV7K,R1YDFW8CPWY29M,Another instant favorite from Gamewright,"  My 8 (almost 9) year old daughter LOVES this game. This, Fabled Fruit, and Sleeping Queens are her favorites, and mine as well. When we first opened it she didn't think she would like it because the artwork isn't as ""fun"" as other cards, but she quickly decided it did have some pretty good stuff. Like a Unicorn and mages and things. This game requires some basic math and a bit of planning/strategy. While the instructions have it set  up to be a competitive game, we often play cooperatively; if both dragons are slain we have decided that means we both win. Highly recommend this game if your child enjoys games that require thought and effort over luck.",5.0
5782,B00UB7OV7K,R26KV32SO2P7BF,"Amazing, fun game",  This game is super fun! My seven year old loves it too. We've played it multiple times since it arrived and we keep wanting more.  We have been very happy with Gamewright Games overall. This is such a great game to play to spend time with the family.  What's great about this game unlike other games is that no one can steal your points that you worked hard to earn. Anyone who plays sleeping queens or monopoly deal knows what I'm talking about. We truly love this game and are so glad it's part of our collection!,5.0
5783,B00UB7OV7K,R3OGCOADHTPMZF,Fun to play with a 2nd grader,"  Fun to play with a 2nd grader and casual players. Takes at least 45 minutes unless you have experienced and quick deciding players. Shadow cloak item is a little over-powered, but you can take it out as a house rule. Rules should probably be worded to say that the ""successful capture party has to escort the creature out of the forest"" so that it is clear from the first reading that you must discard them. We played for the first few times that you kept your team, and it got a little ridiculous with a 6 card attack every time.I like that you remove some cards from the deck each game, so each playthrough has a different balance of items and creatures. Also, shrieking at creatures to capture them (by shear force of will/lung power?) is a fun idea.",5.0
5784,B00UB7OV7K,R1DCY4XEPTOPCC,Spot on for 10 year old!,"  Read lots of reviews before buying this and agree with the positive reviews.  This is perfect for 9-10 year olds.  We watched a Youtube video to see how to set it up because I just learn better that way than reading the instructions but I think the instructions are sufficient for most adults.  I was a little confused from reading only the instructions which deck I was supposed to be removing 12 cards from to begin with but I got it when I watched the Youtube video.  (There are lots out there from which to pick btw.)My 10 year old could not figure out how to play it by reading the instructions herself so kids probably will need an adult to explain it and play it a few times before leaving them to play with other kids their age.Well thought-out game.  After playing it twice, I started pointing out to my daughter about probability and risks/chance and she started catching onto this concept little by little so I do think this game is accurate in stating that it teaches probability.We have never played the previous game that others referred to in other reviews so I can't attest to the game that was prior to this one for younger players.Yes, this game is totally fun with just 2 people!  Sometimes games say 2-4 players and then just aren't as fun with 2, but this one is just as fun with 2 as it would be with 3-4 players.  Younger siblings (ages 6-7) could play along with assistance from an adult also, and I think, still have fun with it.My only suggestion for improvement is tweaking the written instructions for setting up the game (which deck was which) but again, this may have just been me not learning well from reading, to be fair.One more thing- the length of time it takes to complete the game is also spot on for this age group.  We played 2 games and I would say it was between 40-50 mins for each one- and that's partly because we are beginners and had to refer back to the instructions several times to check that we were following them correctly.Glad I bought this!  I usually buy second hand games from Goodwill or yard sales so this was a little on the expensive side for me but I think it's worth the money!",5.0

5786,B00UB7OV7K,R2DPKHA92DZR7F,Fun game!,"  I bought this game as a gift for a 14 year old boy. It is fun, easy to learn, and each round takes about 20 - 30 minutes. Out of the box he was a bit skeptical and thought the artwork was a bit childish but he quickly found the game to be enjoyable. Even his 13 year old sibling got into it even though he is typically not a game player.Pros: easy to learn, family friendlyCons: not very challenging after a few gamesI would recommend this game for kids ages 9 - 14",3.0
5787,B00UB7OV7K,R2TCKPRC79JC6L,A Great / Simple to learn game for the family,  I picked this up and it was exactly as I hoped... I great and fun game with simple rules to just open it up and play. My family (4yo-37yo) had a blast playing this game! You can determine roughly if it's a short game or longer game by how many cards you remove before starting (great for right before bedtime). My 4yo needed some help knowing it was not a good idea to go after certain monsters with only 2-3 dice. :)We're still trying to memorize the different actions you can take depending on the cards you have but they also include at least 2 cards you can leave on the table as reference so you're not staring in the rule book every other turn.Ended up being a fun night for all of us and even though I'm the dragon fanatic Mom won by defeating both dragons herself. Who would have thought out of everyone in the room that Mom would be the dragon slayer!? Wait a second... Moms can handle anything :DIn all seriousness it is a very fun and easy to learn game for the whole family!,5.0
5788,B00UB7OV7K,R2OY10CTHPINED,"Very fun family game, quick and easy to learn.","  Just finished our first game of this.  My son and I loved it.  It feels like a streamlined version of Munchkin with random chance (dice rolls).  My wife hates Munchkin.  She desperately wanted to hate this too, but ended up really enjoying it because of the mix of cards and dice and simplicity.  Gameplay is very straightforward and by the second or third turn you're going without having to figure out the rules anymore.  Gameplay for three people learning the game was about 20-30 minutes.  Offers good replayability because of the random chance element and after the first game it is apparent there is some strategy you can wield.",5.0
5789,B00UB7OV7K,R2YOB2AAQGZKUF,"Great game, easy to learn and fun","  Purchased this game for my 7 year old grandson to introduce him to gaming. He actually loves it and is one of his top requested games to play.We've played with 2-4 players and I find it best with 3. The cards are good quality and don't need sleeves, the quick reference cards have good pictures so even if your gamer can't read, they can still understand. Younger kids may need a helpful partner to make choices or wait to build up your hand of cards at times, or add up the dice values, but it is very easy to learn and play.As he's played more and is now almost 8, I can see improvements in his strategy and decision making, improving the game play for everyone üòÅI've played it with just adults as well and is great for light game between other games or as an intro game for newbies.",5.0

My husband and I play it alone, we play it as a family with my five year old daughter and everyone enjoys it. Grandmas and grandpas have played it with us. It's truly a game for ALL ages! We play it at least two to three times a week. We even take this game with us on vacations!Some reviews claim the instructions are too hard to understand, but my five year old got the hang of it in less than five minutes. I think the instructions are easy to follow and you're even given little cards to keep with you throughout the game to remind you what a strike, stomp and scream is.Buy this game, seriously. You won't regret it!",5.0
5791,B00UB7OV7K,RLYFKVIDSYI1S,"Fun, creative game for your young kids! Adults will like it too.","  I got this for my 7.5 year old niece.  The game is easy for an adult to learn quickly, and even easier to teach your young ones.  The game incorporates mathematics, strategy, fantasy and fun all rolled into one game.  The artwork on the cards is very nice.  You are role playing as an adventurer trying to vanquish magical creatures, and you get points for defeating harder creatures.  You basically draw cards, try to find either a ""run"" (at least 3 numbers in a row), the same colors (at least 3) or the same numbers (at least 3).  Then you get to roll dice for how ever many cards you played.  The game has pre-set end conditions so that it can't last forever, and I found games could last anywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes depending on the conditions you choose (short or long game).  My niece was able to understand the more subtle nuances of the game fairly quickly and I believe it also helped her with her math skills and cause/effect/consequence strategic thinking.  Plenty of fun to be had though because you're slaying dragons and collecting magical gear during  the game.  As an adult, I also found it to be challening and fun for a kid's game.  I highly recommend this game.",5.0
5792,B00UB7OV7K,R15JJQ4DN56A3W,Bridge from kid to adult game,  Enjoyable.  Good bridge from kid games to adult games.  The cards you are trying to capture change how and when they come out from game to game which helps replay.  Only complaint is my daughter was more advanced in game play some haven't gotten that much use out of it.  If you are a casual game playing family I would say recommended age of 8+ is good.  If you are advanced kids might lose interest right after 8 if they want a challenging game.,3.0

We were hoarding cards and being conservative while he was collecting all the easy points.  In the end he won.  We played this in our gaming group with adults and tweens and they enjoyed it.  I'm surprise it's so cheap to get.  Other games I like are King of Tokyo, Munchkin, Survive: Escape From Atlantis, Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, etc. just to give you an idea of my taste.  It's not a heavy game at all.  But not too kiddy to bore adults to death.",5.0
5794,B00UB7OV7K,RGEAWZJLVLE6Y,"Great artwork, easy to learn, good replay value","  Component quality is a solid 5 star.  The artwork is gorgeous.  The game itself is easy to learn.  On your turn, you choose from the available creatures to attack.  You collect cards into runs(strike), sets(stomp), or flushes(scream).  The number of cards you play is the number of dice you can roll.  The if your total points on the dice is equal or greater than the defense of that creature, then you defeat them and collect the trophy points for that creature.  At the end of the game, player with the most trophy points wins.This game exceeded my expectations.  It looks simple.  There's luck, but definitely more skill is required.  The game could be taught in a matter of 2 minutes.  The game is great in every way....but....This is one of those games where after you play the first time, you'll start making your own house rules.  The rules state that on your turn you can pick up a card or play cards for an attack.  Our first game or two had several turns where we just went back and forth picking up cards until one of us had enough to play.  We preferred these house rules to keep the game going faster and more fun:- Everyone starts with 5 cards- On your turn, you can either pick up 1 card or lay down 1 or more cards for an attack.- If you attack and win, you draw cards until you have at least 5 cards in your hand.- If you attack and loose, you do NOT draw cards at the end of your turn (there's no 1 card penalty)- There's no limit to the number of cards you can hold.  There's a rule that states you may not hold more than 9 cards, but we saw no reason for such a limit.  It makes little sense to hold that many cards.  We found it best to eliminate the rule just to keep the rule list shorter.- Ladybug cards are not played until the start of your turn.  If you pick up a ladybug card at the end of your turn, you must wait until your next turn to use it.  You can also save ladybug cards if you wish.- Ladybug cards could either be used to draw two more cards from the deck or played as a wild card as part of your hand (optional).  There's already a wild card in the creature deck, but because it's a one time use card, it's power isn't very balanced compared to other enhancement cards.With these rule modifications, the game tends to go faster.  As a result, we eliminated the end game rules.  We play until every creature has been defeated.  This was also due to the fact that my daughter wanted to play through the whole deck of creatures.The basic mechanics and artwork make this a 5 star game, but the rules and some of the cards didn't seem very balanced.  More could be done with the enhancement cards in regards to balance and usage.  Definitely a solid game that lends itself to house rules to keep it interesting.  Fast and simple.  My daughter loved it.",4.0
5795,B00UB7OV7K,RV33TPEP5QX17,Very cool game!,"  I tend to be a 'heavier' gamer (I really like complex games...), and filler games don't hold my interest most of the time.  My wife got this for me for last xmas, and we've played it 2, 3 and 4 player now several times.  What a cool game!  It is light enough that it is easy to teach, but it has enough meat to it that we enjoyed it very much (anyone that has played it with us, as well).  The age rating on the box is perfect.  My 6 year old daughter would  have a hard time with decisions that would have to be made, but I can see an 8 year old doing just fine.  The youngest that I have played with, though, is my 13 year old son, so that thought is pure speculation (and, of course, every kid is different!!!)....All in all:  Highly recommended!!!",5.0

It's not a boring move your peg kind of game you can really enter the story and adventure created with each play. The pieces are quality material with vibrant colors. There is strategy to be learned but also luck. It makes the game fun up until the last play. We love imagining the attack plans and having fun with it.

5797,B00UB7OV7K,R1Y2X5RD83WIF0,Fantastic family game for a variety of ages,  We got this to interest our 6 year old in games. He loved it and we played every day for the first week. He was so interested in the game he sounded out all the creature names and the cards. It‚Äôs been a struggle to get him to want to read so this was a huge side benefit. It turned the corner on the whole thing. He loves the game so much that he chose to give one to a friend for his birthday. We all enjoy this game. It is simple enough for a kindergartner and still fun for his parents (one of which loves games of all kinds and one really does not but we both enjoy this). This game energized the family enough to want to play games every night.,5.0

5799,B01EB2SRPC,RUZQ64GM1J37D,Best Board Game for a 2-Year-Old,"  DescriptionThis is a perfect game for young children (2-3 or 4 years). In Go Away Monster the goal is to furnish your new bedroom. To play, you draw a tile from a bag with bedroom items (a bed, picture, lamp, and stuffed animal) and monsters. If you draw a bedroom item you get to place it on your bedroom board. If you draw a monster tile you banish it by saying the eponymous, ‚ÄúGO AWAY MONSTER!‚Äù and throwing it into the box. The shape of each tile is different and you choose items by their shape. Some monsters are similar in shape to bedroom items but with small differences.Player reactions:This game is perfect for small children. It introduces the basics of a game (a set of rules and taking turns) with a fun activity. My daughter loves to root around in the bag for a tile. It is easy for her to large bed tiles - but even when they are in the bag she likes to search around for others. Sometimes she even tries to find the monsters on purpose because loves to yell, ‚ÄúGo Away Monster!‚Äù Heck, I like doing it and I am 35! My exaggerated fear and banishment of the monster with gusto gets lots of laughs from her. Children will outgrow the game but there are plenty of anecdotes of 5-year-olds who still enjoy it. It‚Äôs easy but the fun factor of the actions remain.Points of interest:There are a couple other mechanics that you can tweak for your family. The game can be played either a race to find your room tiles first or, if you don‚Äôt like a competition, cooperatively. If you draw a room piece but don‚Äôt need it, give it to a player who does. Even competitively there is no way for the monsters to win - one player finishes fastest, then the next, etc.Should you buy it?This is the best game for a 2-year old child. Other ‚Äúgames‚Äù marketed for this age are turn-taking activities. This is a true game - and is the reason that Go Away Monster is more fun for everyone compared to all competition. Buy the game.",5.0

As demonstrated in my video, you simply take turns pulling pieces out of a canvas drawstring bag and hope to get a piece that is part of your bedroom board. If so, you add it to your board and continue playing until you fill your bedroom with all the necessary pieces (that‚Äôs how you win!). If you pull out a monster piece, you get to shout out, ‚ÄúGo away monster!‚Äù and toss it into the box or aside. You lose your turn, but it‚Äôs still fun!

You have to be willing to be loud and goofy when a monster is pulled for the kids to cut loose too, but the results are adorable/priceless.  (Another reviewer had given this advice  and it really came in handy.)Every time we (the adults) pull a monster we always seem to miss the monster pit (we just use the bottom of the box) while we are acting playfully afraid and saying ""Go Away Monster"". So of course my nephew has to jump to out rescue, grab the monster off the table and toss it in the pit to ""save us"".

He has his own favorite room-board that he uses every time and everything. Plus it's good for his coordination to put the furniture pieces in the right places on the board, and less frustrating than a puzzle - he doesn't like those and starts smashing things in because he can't get them lined up perfectly.

5842,B01MTG2QY2,R10H8TE8IRBY2A,Beautiful and beguiling,"  This is, hands down, one of the prettiest board games I've ever seen.  The concept is fairly simple : build a stained glass window while adhering to the rules.  Same colors can't be next to each other.  Same with numbers.  That red spot on your board?  You can only put a red die in there.  There are several 'shared' goals that are dealt out at the beginning of the game, as well as a 'secret' goal that each player takes.  Dice are randomly drawn from a bag and rolled, and players take turns selecting ones to place them on their boards.  Along the way you can play cards that will allow you to break some of the rules to make your board work for you.  The end result is a board with lovely translucent dice that strongly resembles a stained glass window.  It's quick to learn, a round will take you maybe 20-30 minutes, and there's a surprising amount of strategy involved.  Those first few die you place can absolutely screw you later in the round if you don't plan ahead properly.Side story : My mother was blown away by this game the first time I got it out for us to try.  She told me she was dreaming stained glass dice that night.  If that isn't a glowing recommendation, I don't know what is.",5.0
5843,B01MTG2QY2,R256HHX7G4E2J3,Fun and colorful game ANYONE can play,"  So I am a pretty serious board gamer so when my wife asked for this game I took pause.  Sagrada is not a game I would typically play.  BUT there is something here.  The game plays quickly.  It very easy to pick up.  You are drafting 2 dice a round and placing them into your window.  The thing that elevates this game is the puzzle.  At its heart, Sagrada is a multifaceted puzzle game.  You have to account for color and number when you place your die.  If you mess up or someone drafts what you need, tough luck.  The game introduces powers that you can use (very limited) that can help break those placement rules.The game last about 30 minutes and is played over 10 rounds.  Scoring is determined before the game begins but drawing a few cards from the scoring deck.  Highest score wins.The game has a lot of replayability.  There are are lot of stained glass tiles (double sided), a deck of scoring cards and a deck of special powers.All in all, this is a nice light game that lets me create something beautiful while working on a puzzle.  Great title.  Highly recommended.",4.0
5844,B01MTG2QY2,R2TAJWUMNH7NRM,"Good game for 2 or 3 players, although not quite as good as patchwork","  The game is fun, kind of like solving a sudoku puzzle where there's some limited interaction between players. Some people take too long to make decisions, don't play with someone like that in a group of more than 2 people as there's not much to do while waiting your turn. The game is pretty and well built, and the dice drafting mechanic is unique and fun.I'm glad I bought the game and it's in our rotation, but it's not as good as games like Patchwork or Carcassonne because you're always trying to do the same thing- fill up your grid while maximizing your score. Patchwork has shifting objectives you need to play off against each other. Carcassonne has more interplay between people while building out the map and has more emergent complexity. We pull this game out mostly because we have 3 people and want the fun of the dice drafting game mechanic.",4.0
5845,B01MTG2QY2,R10T50FACR6MUU,Frustrating physical design flaw,"  The game itself is fun. However, I just played it for the first time with friends, and we all found one element extremely frustrating. The play board holes (which holds the dice) are so shallow that it's extremely easy to accidentally knock a die onto a different side, and this completely messes up your board. (""Wait, did I just knock that over? What was it before?"") This happened over and over. If they had just made the board with deeper holes for the dice, this wouldn't be a problem. I know it's just a board game, but I find it to be an insulting money grab choice, indicating that the maker did not play test the game or care enough about the customer.Note that this was adults playing. I can't imagine children with less digital dexterity trying to maneuver these easily rolling dice on this fiddly board.",3.0
5846,B01MTG2QY2,R1I2TXHS71QR81,which is great when you want either a real brain burner,"  This game is simply gorgeous. It is categorized as ""dice drafting"", where you place a die on your player board (or stained glass window in progress) according to pre-set rules. Some spaces require a certain color or number die, and you cannot place two of the same color or number directly next to each other. There is a set of three public objective cards that give you points based if completed, such as having a row of dice of all different colors, pairs of numbers throughout your board, and others. Each player also has a personal objective, which gives them points for each die of a certain color used.  The window cards vary in difficulty, which is great when you want either a real brain burner, or just a beautiful game to look at and play in between others.I wish there were more window cards, the ability to play with more than four total, and a little bigger die- these tend to roll over when you're attempting to place them, which can be frustrating at times. Other than that, definitely a great game!",4.0

5848,B01MTG2QY2,R2OUHIS55BTTC5,Sagrada...I think I love you!,"  Just ordered this game last week after seeing someone on Instragram post how it's the rage with his youth group.  My family hosts Family Game-nights Unplugged in which we don't have any electronics or video games.  We play them the old-fashioned way with cards or boards.  I watched a beautiful tutorial video by Chad Plein on YouTube so I could learn how to play the solo version and then I watched a 2-player game hosted by Watch It Played.  I would recommend these videos if you want additional game play instructions or if you like me, are a visual learner. I played 2 solo games and then took it to my sister's house for a game night.  Well, my 21 y.o. niece didn't really seem to care for it the first time but for the sake of humoring Auntie she said she would play again.  Not sure what happened but she was hooked!  2 days later I was going back for another all night game night and she said, ""Don't forget to bring Sagrada.""  What?  We have really enjoyed it.  In one week we have already had 3 game nights and you would think we had been playing this for years.  We deliberate back and forth on what some of the Tool cards actually mean because prior to this game we had never heard of ""drafting"" dice.  I only knew of drafting in NASCAR and well, this little ballerina girl didn't even understand it in the racing industry.  It was just a term I heard!  My niece loves the more difficult levels that give her 5 and 6 Favor Tokens or as I call them ""Flavor"" tokens.  I hope and pray I get a level of difficulty with 3 or 4...I don't care much about the Favor Tokens and you get points for each one you don't use.  I just want to be able to get my design finished...the easier, the better!  I thoroughly loved the solo play as I enjoyed playing my virtual opponent and trying to beat the Target Score.  I am giving it a 4-star because the dice are so small that sometimes you drop them when trying  to place them on your Window Pattern and you hope and pray you remember the number you were going to use OR that no one else intentionally drops theirs so that they can randomly choose a new numeric value of their choice for game play.  Get my gist on what can happen?  Also, I wish the Tool Cards were explained a little better. There are illustrations but many of them we didn't understand.  I feel  Floodgates could have added an extra page or 2 in the manual to thoroughly describe how all 12 Tool cards could be used.  Overall, this is a really fun game and I'm so glad it can also be a solo game because that gives me another game I can play when home alone.  Because this game is for 1-4 players I am also including the list of supplies that comes in the Sagrada Expansion Set that allows you to add 1 or 2 additional players to your game.  Amazon doesn't tell you what all comes in the Expansion Set; just says it's for 5-6 players.  I googled the Expansion Set and Barnes & Noble (not Floodgates) provided a list of what all comes in the box. The dice tray is a perk but since I don't see myself being able to recruit more than 4 people to play at once I am ordering collapsible dice rolling trays instead of the Expansion Set.  Note: Contents below are for the Expansion Set NOT the game you are looking at above!!Contents:40 Dice2 Player Boards (Yellow & Orange)1 Dice Tray6 Window Pattern cards2 Tool cards6 Objective cards6 Private Dice Pool boards2 Score markers12 Favor tokens1 Rule bookThe compartments in the Sagrada box seem to be really deep so I would think you wouldn't have a problem putting the new supplies into your box. My only thought: Is the dice tray collapsible? If it's not then it might be too deep in dimension to place in the original box because of how the black tray with compartments is constructed. BUT one could remove the black compartment tray and re-organize everything! After all, the Sagrada box is fairly deep.",4.0
5849,B01MTG2QY2,RPMA11GAK7EPM,A Jewel of a Family Game,  Sagrada is a family favorite! My adult kids got it as a kickstarter and I love it so much I ordered one to play while visiting another kid! We also ordered a mini dice tower to make rolling all those dice easier-also available from Amazon. Great for multi-age groups.I love the jewel tone dice which very much remind me of the stunning windows at the famous La Sagrada Familia in Barcelona.,5.0
5850,B01MTG2QY2,RCUDGL8ZOCYFE,"Fun, quick, puzzly game","  I hate dice games but I love games that take random dice rolls and ask you to do something strategic with them. So while the luck of the dice color draw and roll may or may not work for your plans, you do have agency in the use of those dice in regards to choosing and playing them appropriately in your 'window'.  Players can block others with their choice of dice-taking but it's not as cut-throat or strategic as 'Azul' in that regard.The variety in the dice and all the different cards also give Sagrada a high replay value. Your play area, or 'window', has its own card with set numbers and colors you need to match and work with; the ways you get points are based on cards that are different each game; you get a different personal goal each game; and there are variable 'tool' cards that give you different ways of swapping dice or changing your board.Sagrada also has a relatively quick play time and is quite snappy with 2 players, making it the sort of game you can play a couple times in a row.  It's also very colorful and satisfying to look at with well-made components and you can pack the entire game into half a gallon zip bag if you want to take it somewhere without the box.I have about 100 games in my collection and Sagrada is a great addition. I like to use ""Castles of Burgundy"" as a very loose comparison, as they are both games that use random dice rolls that require strategy to use, though CoB is a much deeper and longer playing game - Sagrada is a nice appetizer for table top gamers used to meatier games and will likely be a satisfying main course for those new to tabletop gaming.",5.0
5851,B01MTG2QY2,R26P4XLEQI5VEM,"Fun game, could use minor improvements","  Wife got this for Christmas (I helped Santa pick it out), plus the expansion pack right away.Family enjoys the game--my overly competitive daughter always claims I'm stealing her dice!  It requires thought and planning as you play the game.  It took a few games to get the feel for it (namely the terms used), but game play moves along at a good pace once you understand the rules.  Each game doesn't last too long which is good.The expansion pack is a good addition.  It was nice that the core game box was designed to allow the expansion pieces to fit without issue, including the dice tray that is part of the expansion.We do play with one ""house"" rule: when a player uses Favor Tokens for a Tool, that Tool card is discarded and a replacement card drafted.  That seems to mix things up a bit.  We've also taken to using the Expansion Personal Objective cards exclusively.",5.0

5853,B01MTG2QY2,R25UEJIXQVW5RL,"Pretty fun ""abstract"" game","  I read a lot of reviews before purchasing because I wanted to make sure that the game play was easy enough for most people to jump in.  I've recently gotten into ""board gaming"" and have been eyeing games like Sagrada, Azul and Reef.  This is my first foray into this abstract gaming concept.To sum up game play, players take turns picking a colored die and placing it on their pre-selected window tile.  There are only a few three key rules: you must place a die next to an existing one, you can't place same colored die next to each other, neither the same number next to each other.  There are 10 rounds of game play for you to fill up your window.  If you play it right, you should be able to fill in every square.  So, in all, the rules are pretty straightforward.What gets complicated is the further into the rounds you get, you start to self limit placement options based on past decisions.  Along with the just filing in the window, you have public and private challenges that will help you garner points at the end and determine the winner.  And while you may think you have the prettiest window, meeting objectives is what actually wins you the game.All in all, me and my kids really liked it.  We played two games in a row after opening, the first to get the hang of it and then a second to ""really"" play.  Each game is about 30 minutes and is pretty fun.  It makes you think and while there is a competitive aspect, all of that happens at the end.  Game play is relatively peaceful and is fun to see how dice are placed.I give this game 5 stars.

The favor tokens (clear glass beads) could be improved - make them colorful to match each game board or have some sort of customization.

It IS beautiful, the dice are good quality, the cards beautifully designed and well made, and the monogrammed, pull string dice bag is a lovely product for pulling (and storing) the dice. For the product alone it is worth the money. We‚Äôve only played once so far, but I love the replay ability and foresee many fun, window building game nights to come.I really don‚Äôt have a fault to give the game, and can‚Äôt really fault the small dice because I had read a previous review stating the size of the dice made game play a bit tedious during placement, and more difficult for elderly players. I was prepared for ‚Äúsmaller than normal dice‚Äù, or so I thought. Y‚Äôall, they really ARE small. I do wish the company had spanned the overall game design up.. just a smidge even would help. I‚Äôm attaching a few photos just so others can be better aware of the size differences. It is a lovely game and I don‚Äôt regret our purchase. If they make a revised edition with larger dice then I would purchase as gifts. As of now, I wouldn‚Äôt hurt because of the size it‚Äôs really more of a personal family choice if it‚Äôs appropriate for their household... no small children, or possible dice-chasing pups, or and definitely more difficult for players with limited eyesight or failing fine motor coordination.I do love it though. It is lovely.(Photos shown comparison to the game Ligretto Dice, which has regular sized dice. There are 24 colorful dice in each pile, showing size comparison. Sagrada dice are about half the size of ‚Äúregular‚Äù sized dice. The Stained-Glass Window game board is just a bit bigger than the size of my hand.)",4.0

I find that dice games are attractive to a broad range of people. What we like about Sagrada outside of its aesthetics is the small dash of strategy required to play an otherwise random dice game. Choosing which dice, being limited by a board, choosing based on public and private goals, and using chips to alter outcomes. There is just enough to keep strategists engaged while appealing to spouses, kids, and extended family. I highly recommend this game. Ten rounds is over in 30 minutes. Not too long either.",5.0

Game play is not difficult, though you can put some thought into your strategy, especially if you take into consideration not only your goals but the guessed-upon goals of your opponents. The best part about it is the replay-ability factor, meaning that the cards create a slightly different gameplay experience every time, which keeps it interesting on multiple play-throughs.

It is great that this game has a limited length (10 rounds) and dice rolls that ensure you can't completely predict what will come up next. You can strategize and have a plan, but you need to roll with whatever comes up, and this limits the reasonable deliberation time. It can be a little frustrating if the dice don't go your way, or your fellow players take the one die you can use, but there are tool cards that may be able to get you out of a tough place.

I was searching for a new game to give to a family member for Christmas when I stumbled onto some reviews for Sagrada. I was a little hesitant to buy a game without personal recommendations from other trusted gamers I know, but I am so glad that I did. Sagrada is such a beautiful board game with a lot of replayability. The concept and play is pretty simple, but with the variable cards and rolled dice used, it is a new game every time. I think it is really similar in some ways to Azul (game of the year for 2018) but instead of building a tiled masterpiece, in Sagrada you are building a stained glass window. The variable colors and numeric value of the dice all play into the final scoring and there are different templates that can be used for variety.

It can be a bit tricky to learn at first because there are so many rules to keep in mind at once (although if you forget a couple it's okay, you just may not get as many points), but after you play it a time or two you start to get the hang of it and it's super fun. (If it's too tricky at first, you can just take out the extra goals until you learn the basics). One downside is that only 4 people can play at a time unless you buy the extension pack.

This game oozes with theme. Each player represents a different fashion company that over the course of the game does 4 fashion shows that each have different criteria (public relations, quality, number of designs being shown, and trending). At the beginning of each round you place one of your three workers in anyone of 9 spaces. Space 1 is for a bank loan, space 2 is gaining contracts that provide you benefits at no cost but deteriorate over the course of the game, space 3 is buying building that increase your upkeep but provide you different benefits, space 4 is buying new employees that also increase your upkeep and provide benefits, space 5 is gaining new designs, space 6-8 is buying materials for designs at different prices, the more expensive grants you better quality and thus more quality tokens and space 9 is either getting money, PR, trending or quality. The winner at the end of the game is the one who has the most victory points and money combined. Everything works so well together and the rules are not to difficult to understand. I would say this is a medium to heavy board game. The components are very good quality, thick player boards, wooden player tokens, wooden material tokens, great board, but the score markers are a bit small and flimsy. The only complaint I have is that during the course of the game, it seems essential to get at least 1 accountant employee in your company, otherwise you will accumulate to much debt and other players may get to many accountants leading to one player collecting a large amount of money, which essentially is points. This is a small complaint and knowing this for future games definitely helps. Highly recommend this game.",5.0

5878,B0725LRH1W,R2210B8LQA7HTG,The bloom is already off the rose.,"  I was disappointed in several ways.Brand new, shrink-wrapped copy of the game--upon opening, I immediately noticed frayed, bent cardboard. The kind of wear and tear that's perfectly acceptable for used games, but surprising for a new one. Not a problem, I said; it's not a big deal.Then I opened the trait cards. They were fine, but right away I saw that they were going to be a problem: they felt thin and cheap in my hand. I handed them around to a few buddies with a lot of card game experience. We all  made the same prediction: these weren't going to last long! Okay, I thought--I can look past cheaply made materials, so long as the game is fun.The game is alright. Just alright. And despite the heaps of praise you'll find for the Evolution series in Nature, on Kickstarter, and elsewhere, it doesn't have *that* much to do with evolution. Maybe a step above, say, Pokemon in that regard. The gameplay itself is actually pretty predictable. They make a big deal out of how many combinations are possible, but those numbers are really paltry compared to just about any other card game (""possible species"" vs. possible hands in poker, possible decks or hands in Magic: The Gathering, etc).But it isn't a bad game. It just isn't good enough to carry its price-tag, or to warrant the hype. I couldn't get the price-tag out of my head while I went through the initial set-up. $50... did I need a wooden dinosaur to keep track of the first player? Did I need a wooden climate marker? Did I need a second laminated crib sheet? Did I need an ugly lizard printed on all four food bags? Did I need food bags at all? Did I need to spend $50.Even the artwork lost its charm rather quickly. After a few cards you realize that it's the same thing again and again: they put weird stripes on a wolf, they put a lizard's head on a pig's body, they put weird strips on an elephant, they put an elephant's head on a...In short, I think we should all be a little more critical and less forgiving with North Star Games. Despite being a very successful, well-established company, they still run Kickstarter campaigns--simply because they know they can squeeze another $500k out of their fans. They've perfected the art of marketing, promotion, and running kickstarter campagins, but are they actually investing in their product? After a few play-throughs, my friends and I had the same question. This is an expansion? You mean to tell me that the original game *didn't* have the climate mechanic(s)?I feel bad for spending $50 on this game, but I feel worse for those who spent $50 on a previous version of this game (which must have been a snooze fest).I recommend this game if you get it at a deep discount; it isn't an awful game.

5879,B0725LRH1W,R3B7A50HTK5UQ0,"Simple, Yet... Complex?","  Evolution (the game) manages to pull off what few modern games can.  On the one hand, the engine and the basic rules of the game are fairly simple.  Every action is based off playing the trait cards you have in hand.  Play a card to put food in the water hole (everyone has to do this each turn); or play a card for its traits (the words); or play a card to gain a species; or play a card to grow your species.  Then, you eat the food.  The food you eat is your points.  If you don't eat enough food, some of your population starves.  Draw more cards.  Rinse, repeat until the deck is dry.  It was simple enough that when I played for the first time with my 6 and 8 year olds, who typically stink at action based games, both were doing just fine.But the traits themselves give an excellent level of complexity to the game.  Once you start having multiple species who have evolved into carnivores, who have horns to defend against attacks, who can migrate and climb and hibernate, etc etc etc., the gameplay blossoms wonderfully.  The choices you make on your turn become meaningful, which is precisely where you want to be in a game like this: you want your choices to matter, not the engine.  Yet, because all the rules for each trait are on cards, everyone can see exactly what's going on.  No one is unfairly surprised because the rules for ""fatty tissue"" is buried in the appendix.  This also makes Evolution easy to teach.""What does climbing do, dad?""""What does the card say?""""Oh, right.  So you can't attack me!  Ha!""I am very excited to get this to the table again.  Far too often, modern games have complex rules to go with complex gameplay.  To have a family-friendly, quasi-educational game like Evolution buck that trend is a great thing for families and groups who enjoy light to medium games.Note that we played without the climate rules, as suggested by the developer.  They will certainly make the game more complex, as you are worried not only about being eaten by your kids' carnivores but the risk of hypothermia, heat exhaustion, and volcanic eruption.  I will bring these rules out after 4 or 5 playthroughs, I imagine.  For more advanced gamers, they seem absolutely great and a lot of fun.

I eventually got both for my copy of this game and had different thoughts on them both.In the end I might be a purist, the best version of this game for me is the base game with nothing else added.  Climate especially just added clutter to the game that wasn't needed.  I don't feel like anything worthwhile was introduced into the game but instead we just had more rules to follow and complications to attend to with hot or cold.The addition of it took away from what what just a simple and fun game to start with.It is possible if I had started originally with a the full Climate game my opinion would be different but as it is, I would not add the conversion kit to a copy of Evolution to change it.

We both love playing Settlers of Catan (and all the expansions) and have been playing these games for years so I admit I was a little hesitant/skeptical that this game could even come close to being as awesome as Catan. I'm so glad I have it a try. The artwork on Evolution Climate is gorgeous and the game itself is full of depth. There is certainly an element of strategy involved as you create and evolve your own species but the climate aspect adds a level of uncertainty that makes this game interesting (and addicting!). We've never had two games turn out the same way - each time we play is a unique situation. If you're into Settlers of Catan or games like it I highly recommend Evolution Climate for a fun new board game addiction :-).

The success of your species depends on what others do. Getting attacked by predators, add a defense mechanism.  Great!  Until the predator adapts to your defense.

It was super easy to teach and after about 15-20 min we were off and running. I played several games with 5-6 players and it was a great time. Now here comes the but ... the entire time I felt like it needed something like a bit of polish.  I liked the game play and making your own species is super cool and hit that nerdy itch. I just couldnt shake the felling like was missing something. So I did some digging and found it is offered on SOME mobile devices and steam. On mobile if available its free and on steam its like $15. So I hedged my bets and bought the steam version because my phone was not compatible. And oh boy I was not disappointed the steam version allows you to do a campaign that varied the theme and gives you a varied difficulty AI to play against.  Then my Gf got on her phone and downloaded the free version..... and was able to play with and against me on my steam version. This irritated me a bit at this point I had bought the board game and steam version to then see it could be free. All you would need is internet and your phone and 4 friends(4 is the limit online) could play for free.  That being said I am not regretting my purchases and have looked into the expansions (which arent available on the digital version).I can easily recommend this game. I would say if youre on the fence or dont plan on playing with more than 4 people check if its available on you phone. Give it a spin and see what you think. Then see if you want the physicalversion.I am not bashing this game its great and I will continue to play both versions.In Summary -The digital versionOn the phone is free and on steam is $15.These are cross compatible and can play with each other .The limit is 4 players.There are new cards to purchase through the digital versionCampaign and AI to play againThe Physical Board2-6 playerstwo expansions,4.0

A game you can actually play with a wide variety and # of players which is rare. First opening the box and looking at all the pieces and the manual you think it is complicated, too complicated. However, once you play it once you quickly get the hang of the concepts and strategy. I suggest you use YouTube video tutorials as an introduction to new players rather than reading the manual; it goes much faster and as long as one person knows the messy details you can bring them up when needed. I also suggest that you use the alternative fast play style for all #s of players rather than just the 5-6 players as suggested. It makes a big improvement in the flow of gameplay leaving each player with less downtime and feels more like a video game where everyone is playing at once together rather than waiting a turn.The artwork is gorgeous, the materials feel high quality. The Climate part can be left out if you want to simplify things. I worried for a first play through with non-serious gamer friends that the Climate part would be too complicated, but they insisted and it actually turned out great! Climate definitely adds interesting effects and strategies, and it might even be a way you can turn some people around to understanding climate change without actually debating and throwing science at them!

I found with this game, learning it definitely came faster as you played.Additionally, I was thoroughly impressed with the thickness of the cardboard tokens, species boards, and watering hole. They are extremely durable, and feel like a high quality product. Even my 8 year old nephew was able to easily pick up and use the pieces (although the nuances of the strategy were a little much, but overall he played just fine with the adults and slight parent coaching).The cards as well were pretty firm, and the instructions are glossy and the pages have some weight.",5.0

You have to build animals with different traits, then have them grow in size and multiply to avoid being eaten. It‚Äôs a little fiddly with all the species cards and boards. It is fun, though.

5925,1933054395,RB2PHJUEGXSGW,The Game to Play with Non Gamers,"  I have been enlightened. Throughout my childhood and for the majority of my adult life I was resigned to the notion that the board gaming landscape was sparse and barren. Populated only by a few unenticing, played out old names like Life, Scrabble and Monopoly (Which to this day, I'm certain has never seen a match played to completion). However, my eyes were opened by a new wave of innovative, engaging titles like Pandemic, Small World, 7 Wonders and many more. I've been a true believer and tabletop enthusiast ever since. Alas there is one big problem... Most people I know have the same narrow minded approach to board games as I once did. It just isn't easy to get a group together. The heavy fantasy and sci fi themes of my favorite games only serve to compound that difficulty as it seems to create  an illusion of complexity and carries with it the stigma of intense nerdiness. I can see the eyes start to glaze over when I attempt to broach the subject. Whatever shall I do?Enter Qwirkle! This game relies on such a simple concept of matching colors and shapes that it would be easy to dismiss this as something childish, certainly beneath that of any respectable gamer. But that is the beauty of it. It dumps the polarizing themes that tend to put newcomers off and the rules are so straightforward that the game can be explained in just a few sentences. What little confusion one might have is usually resolved within a couple of turns and suddenly a world of strategy begins to unfold as you subtly try to mislead, block, and steal combinations from the clutches of your beloved opponents. It is truly a wonderful tool for family bonding and better still, it serves as a gateway game to pull loved ones into the world of table top games.That was my fiendish plan all along and the reason I even bought this game to begin with. With little effort, I was able to coax my niece, dad and step mom to give it a try. The result was a super fun evening of laughter and surprisingly stiff competition. I narrowly secured a victory with my last move and that alone is a testament to the excellent game design. The game was so captivating and easy to learn that there was virtually no handicap for newcomers. If you would like to dip your toes into board games or perhaps coerce a particularly resistant individual to give them a try, I cannot recommend Qwirkle enough.",5.0
5926,1933054395,R2D6IX946V9VEF,Great game! Regarding missing pieces & different packaging...,"  A lot of people are talking about receiving the game with missing instructions & pouch. Mine was also missing the instructions & pouch. However, I contacted Amazon, and promptly received a replacement along with a free-shipping RMA. To my surprise, the new one was very different.First, the box is much bigger. It also has different labeling on the front. Most importantly, it seems to be made by different companies. The original smaller box (missing instructions & pouch) is made by Smart Elephant, where the new larger one is made by MindWare. There are also a few other differences in the front. The backs are completely different. I won't detail each difference, but I will post pics showing the differences.After seeing the pouch and instructions, I don't see how the Smart Elephant version *could* contain the pouch alone, not to mention the pouch *and* instructions. The tiles are such a snug fit in the box, it would have to bulge in order for the folded pouch -- and particularly the draw-strings -- to fit.And this is even though the bottom-front cover of the Smart Elephant box clearly states ""Instructions Included"", and the back also lists ""1 bag"" and ""1 instruction booklet"" in the list of components. So I'm not sure if this is a counterfeit or if it's just poor production.Regardless, if you don't get the MindWare version, you should probably contact Amazon for a replacement. If anyone has the Smart Elephant version and it contains the instructions and pouch, please post in the comments.As for the game itself, I think it's great. It's sort of a mix between Scrabble and Uno, where you have 6 sets of shapes and 6 sets of colors (36 total unique tiles x 3 of each tile = 108 total tiles). When you place a tile, it has to match *either* the shape *or* the color of the set of all adjacent tiles.You score a point for each tile in any set(s) you create/extend (similar to scoring in Scrabble), plus a bonus 6 tiles for any sets (of 6 colors or shapes) you complete. The set you're creating/extending cannot contain two of the same shape (for a color set) or two of the same color (for a shape set) -- each set has to be made up of 6 or less unique tiles of the same color or shape.Regarding age, the game is rated for six and up, though it could probably be played by an even younger audience. Of course, younger players may not be able to use strategy to the same level older players can, but most will still be able to have a good time. Our six-year-old actually was able to pull off some pretty clever moves against us (beating the three of us in the end), but at other times, he struggles.The other thing to take into account is the level of patience some younger players may need while everyone else is trying to figure out their move. It may make sense to play less strategically in the interest of speed to keep their interest. This may be the biggest issue for us, and depending on the mood, a more fast-paced game may be more appropriate.Regarding quality, the tiles (in the edition as of this writing) are painted wood. We haven't played enough to determine if they will eventually wear, but they seem of good enough quality. The pouch (assuming you get one!) can be used to store the tiles when not being used, as well as being used to draw from during play.",5.0

So why am I giving this 4 stars? Because the design of the Box is not well-thought-out. Original packaging have all the tiles shrink wrapped. They fit tightly in the box with the bag and instructions compressed under them.I soon realized there was a design flaw in the box.  After the game is opened, the box is useless.  There is a hole in the top of the box so you can see the tiles. However there is no plastic guard to prevent tiles from falling out and you can't close the bagin the box.

5928,1933054395,R1YZ3NY55CEEZI,It's a fun simple game,"  I already knew we enjoyed this game from playing it with friends, so I bought one for our own house.  It's a fun simple game where you're trying to create ""qwirkles"" which are a row of six pieces of either the same shape or same color with no repeating pieces.  Pieces are placed like dominoes and scored by how many pieces in a row you've created.  Simple and fun.  I also love that it has nice thick real wood blocks to play with.  There's always something nice about the feeling of real wood and having a substantial piece in games.  It comes with a cloth bag for holding all the pieces for you to draw from.  You'll want to store the pieces in the bag too as that ""window"" on the game box is a cut-out that risks losing a piece.  No problem though, we still keep it in the box just with the pieces in their bag.  We also toss in a notebook and marker for scoring.The rules are simple to explain so it's easy to get new people to play.  The game can be quite complex as you might play shrewdly by never placing a 5th piece and therefore giving an opponent the chance to qwirkle it.  You might also track what pieces remain out by knowing that there are three of every piece in the game.  It's as simple or complex as you want to make it.You'll see an example of my husbands game-smashing TRIPLE qwirkle in my photo.  Notice he is completing a row of diamonds, a row of orange, and a row of green.",5.0

In poor weather we often play 3 games a day.  This one is a particular favorite of mine because my 6 year old can play with a bit of help, but we will be able to play this at any age.  Also, from a homeschooling perspective, letting my son keep score is a great way to have him practice writing numbers and doing addition without realizing he is learning.  I think the box is absolutely enormous and the game is too heavy for us to take anywhere, but this is a frequently reached for game in our house.

There is no space remaining in the bag at the start of the game for the tiles to be shaken.Graphics were off center in 90% of the tiles - look at the product description pictures versus what we received.Wood was split on many tiles (examples in pictures).Thickness of tiles was inconsistent.

Our friends absolutely love this game.  They play it almost every night in their home.  They are in their late 60's.  We are in our 50's.  The last time they came over to play games we added our daughter-in-law who is 25.

This game is a hit for all ages, grown ups and children.  We started playing this game for Family Board Game night with a 3 year old and a 6 year old.  Since there is no reading, it is a great game for adults to play with young children.  Of course because of the scoring mechanism, young children will not be able to play without adults.  That is ok because this game is so much fun for mom and dad.  (What grown up wants to play Chutes and Ladders or Candyland when there is Qwirkle‚Ä¶.I also recommend Labyrinth as a Family game.)  Our 6 year old was the most talented in the family at noticing Qwirkles. Our 3 year old, of course, needed help.  Now, three years later at age 6 and 9, this game is still our favorite and brings many happy memories.  I highly recommend for families with both younger and teenage children as well as empty nesters and board game hobbyists.  Another plus is that you could say this game challenges our brain with a little bit of math pattern recognition and strategy.  A winner for puzzle lovers at any age.",5.0

It is easy to learn and great fun, and no two games ever go the same.  It's got the gameplay and strategy elements (and scoring) of Scrabble, with the simplicity of dominoes.  My family ranges from kids to seniors, and everyone had to have a turn playing Quirkle this year.There are no complicated instructions (more than half the instruction book that comes with it is a sample game), and once it's out of the box, it comes with a drawstring bag to store the tiles in.  Other than that, the only things you need to play are a table (floor, counter, or any flat surface) and notepad and pencil to keep score, so this would be great if you are looking for something portable.Highly recommended!12/15/19 Update - This is still a favorite game for all my family and friends.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the hole in the box is a pain in the rear, it's impossible to store the tiles back in the box without modification and difficult to keep the rules in the bag.  I printed a small copy of the rules and laminated it so I could keep the copy in the bag, but I also taped a piece of white cardboard over the hole in the box so I could keep the tiles in it as well.I've gotten a second set of regular Qwirkle to combine and allow playing with more people, and two sets of Qwirkle Cubes (again for more people).  As long as you have a big enough table, you can combine multiple sets and keep adding up to 4 more players!  Same rules, same scoring, same number of tiles in each hand, just lots more tiles.  I will say that Qwirkle Cubes is my new favorite over regular Qwirkle.  It has the extra strategy element of being able to roll the cubes to try to get another shape (more fun for adults), no need to hide your tiles from the other players, and the cubes are a more compact size and can actually be stored in the original box.",5.0

They are very close in color and depending on the lighting, they look alike. If the blocks are tipped a bit, which is what we do by mounting them on L-shaped pieces of molding, cut into 8‚Äù strips.

Many of the wooden blocks were stuck together, maybe by the black paint, but I had to ""snap"" them apart and what was left is pictured. I used a Sharpie to fill in the bare areas. Also note the picture in the one tile- really wonky. There were quite a few like this as well, just off-center or a bit smaller than their cohorts.

One 10 year old found it not exciting, but the 12 year old showed great strategy and it kept her interest. Great for adults. The wood tiles are blocky and feel good to handle. The enamel finish is nice, but we have an issue with the colors.Although the colors look vivid in the pictures, the colors on black background can be hard to see in artificial lighting. White background would be much easier on the eyes, even for normally sighted individuals. My husband has red/green colorblindness and cannot tell the colors. The blue and purple look exactly alike to him. I had to take a permanent marker and write the first letter of each color in the center of each tile. It would be nice if the company would modify this to have a white background and make the colors more vivid, such as more difference between orange and red and between blue and purple.",4.0
5940,1933054395,R9DIL0E5K3R0M,Bag too small,  Our family has played Quirkle for years . It's a favorite. Our old tiles were finally wearing out so we ordered a new game. The company is now cutting corners. With Quirkle there is a bag to hold the tiles and you use your hand to mix up the tiles in the bag before starting a new game. The new bag is considerably smaller and you cannot mix up the tiles in the bag. There isn't enough room for the tiles and your hand. It's a shame. I've given it as a gift to all my grandchildren but no more.,3.0

5942,1933054395,R15M0VTDQGSD6Y,Fun Family Game,"  Our family loves this game! It is fun and works well for a wide range of ages. The game concept is very easy to understand and simple to teach, but the logic and strategy potential adds more depth for the more advanced/mature players. The pieces are a nice size and easy to grab. The shapes and colors are vibrant, distinct, and easy to see.My only very minor complaint is difficulty in storing the game between uses. The bag with the game pieces does not fit back in the box very well for storage. I like to store it in the box so that it stacks nicely with other games, otherwise I would just store it in the bag. I'm sure there are things I could do to make it work better.

5943,1933054395,R2N88P9Q247YF2,Fun and Challenging,"  Love, love, love this game. We found it in a lodge one weekend when we'd forgotten to take our usual games--Scrabble, Mexican Train and Rumikube. It took us a while to learn how to play it, even though there were instructions in the box. Ordered it as soon as we got home. We referred to the pictures in the instructions for weeks and misinterpreted them every way possible. During this hot Arizona summer, we have played it morning and afternoon every Saturday and Sunday instead of doing brutal yard work. Goes well with late afternoon cocktails!This is a strategy game simple enough for children and complex enough for adults. One can play offensively or defensively with different outcomes for each approach. Partially cooperative with opponent or completely disruptive. We have never played with more than the two of us. Each round takes about 30 minutes. We usually play three rounds at a go.(The bag that came in the game will hold all the tiles but is a couple inches too small for mixing the tiles. We tried lots of different ways to mix the tiles until we settled on mixing in a small shopping bag--smaller than a grocery tote. Not a big enough issue to deduct a star.)",5.0

The blocks are well made and don't feel cheap.We bought this as a birthday gift for one of our children, but it immediately became the property of the whole family because everyone wanted to play it when they had friends over. We've all kind of taken the game over.One thing to note is that if the lighting isn't good where you are sitting it might be hard to distinguish the red from the orange or distinguish the dark colors because they are the background is black, so keep that in mind if playing with someone with poor eyesight. My eyesight isn't poor but I often had to shift my seating to be sure of the color if there was a glare or the lighting wasn't right.Highly recommended!",5.0

To be honest, there's not much I can say that 800+ glowing reviews haven't already said.  However, what I can add is a caution to be sure you get a genuine Qwirkle game.  We already own Qwirkle and love it and wanted to give one to our daughter's friend for her birthday, so I bought another one from this Amazon listing.  When the product came, the box was significantly smaller than our Qwirkle, the image on the box was slightly fuzzy, and there was no UPC code printed on the box.  These signs made me wonder if something was not right with the version we received, so I opened the box to find that instead of real wood tiles, this was a cheap knockoff with plastic tiles and no instruction manual nor drawstring bag (both critical to be able to actually play the game!)I purchased the item directly from Amazon, not from a third party seller, so it appears some fake / counterfeit items have worked their way directly into Amazon's inventory.The easiest way to identify if you have a counterfeit Qwirkle is from the box.  If it looks like the box in this listing (a separate Amazon listing that is directly selling the counterfeit Qwirkle):¬†

My only real complaint is how to store the game. It comes in a box that has a hole in the lid so if you were to store the blocks freely in the box then they would fall out of the top. If you store it in the cloth bag, it doesn‚Äôt fit in the box. So the only solution is the keep the blocks in the bag and toss the box.",4.0

I bought this game as a family present from Santa this past Christmas.  This game is for really anyone.  It's a cross between scrabble, dominos, and rummy kub.  It has colorful wooden tiles and a draw bag comes in the box.  The box is really nice.  The game was Germany Spiel des Jahres a couple years back, which is saying something, since achieving that rank is sort of a worldwide recognition.  This game is light, easily played, and easily scored.  But it still takes some strategy and brain useage.  My 6-yo gets it.  My 5-yo will get it soon; she usually plays on my wife's ""team.""  My 3-yo won't get it for a while, but he likes to build things with my tiles while I'm playing.  We put the kids to bed and me and my wife played alone.  I bought this game for my mother-in-law too, and she was way excited.  This same company makes another game we bought called Q-Bits.  My 5-yo and 6-yo get that game, it also is a high quality wooden game, and it's also a thinking game.  I have to say BIG thumbs up on Santa.

5953,1933054395,RBP2ZCR6T102F,"Fantastic game!  Simple to learn, but really deep.","  This game has very simple rules.  You can only play tiles in a single line.  That line has to either be all of the same symbol, but different colors, or all different symbols of the same color.  You score points based on how many tiles are in a line when you're done playing your turn.  That's it.  Trust me, it's easier than it sounds.Once you get the basic rules down, you can participate in the game.  After about 8-10 turns, the rules will become second-nature...and that's when the fun begins.  You'll stop thinking about ""can I make this move?"" and start thinking, ""WHY should I make this move?""  After your first game, you'll begin thinking, ""If I make this move, can I build on it later?  Can my opponents?  Should I make this now, or wait until someone else makes a play on that line?""...and so on.Just like Go or Tsuro, this is a very simple game with surprisingly deep strategy.  It's a perfect ""gateway"" game to get non-gamers into playing ""real"" games like Catan, Ticket to Ride, Carcassone, and other non-Parker Brothers games.  You can then use those games to gateway them into more complicated games like Lords of Waterdeep, Pandemic, Puerto Rico, etc.  Soon you'll have generated another gaming fan, and let's face it...the world needs more gamers!",5.0
5954,1933054395,R25QAXSIACND0X,Family Favorite!!!  Mix of Sudoku and Dominos!,"  This has quickly become a family favorite!  I would call it a mix between sudoku and dominos where you have to match colors and/or shapes without repeating any color or shape in a row.  If you're lucky enough to get all 6 of either a shape or color in one turn,  you get the maximum points which is called a ""Qwirkle"".  There is a lot of strategy involved and you have to look in all directions to make sure you are getting the most points possible.  A couple of times we've noticed that someone had actually repeated a shape or color and no one noticed for a couple of turns which was quite funny, but we kept on and finished anyway.  There are 6 shapes and 6 colors with 3 of every tile so the possibilities are endless!!  It takes about 20-30 minutes to play depending on how fast or slow some of the players are, so it doesn't take forever.  We've found even some young kids are able to pick up on this although they might need a little bit of assistance.  Great family game!",5.0

Please see pictures I have included. The tiles are plastic and the letters aren't centered which is not a big deal to me. However when playing the first word,  Gone as soon as I laid down the O the G popped up. When fixing the G the O popped out. The pictures will show what I mean. I wish I hadn't been cheap and would have ordered the Deluxe Scrabble with wooden tiles and the elevated plastic tile lock board. This isn't worth the money.

5958,1223063151,RPQXKQRRHNGWJ,Locking tiles is a misrepresentation,"  Scrabble it is... locking tiles it isn't.  I guess I didn't catch the other review(s) saying the same thing.  Essentially it's good if you're playing on the couch or some unstable surface... but I don't know that it would qualify as a ""travel"" version.  The description clearly states it's ideal for playing scrabble in the car, plane, train, etc. -- if the tiles were magnetic and the board folded, yes it would be perfect travel edition.  If the tiles actually locked in place, it would be an ideal travel board.As it is -- the locking tiles allow you to tilt the board at various angles (but not far past 45¬∞ lest the tiles start falling out).Only other minor gripe is the drawstring bag is a little skimpy if you also plan to put the tile holders (red long rectangles) in with the tiles.... it's literally 1/4"" too short to safely secure everything.  I wouldn't trust it with my kids packing it up... unless they put the pouch in a ziplock.",2.0

It makes the components feel cheap.-The board surface is a sticker over plastic. I feel like any accidental drink spill will ruin it, or it will start to peel off.Overall, it's the same great game but if you want that taste of nostalgia, this may not be the ideal version for you.",3.0

The board and tiles are larger than either the folio or the classic travel version, but overall the game is still very compact.  The board does not fold, but it is very thin and fits into luggage just as easily as the folding folio version. While the tiles don't actually ""click"" in, the knobs on each square corner keep the tiles in place pretty well and the pieces are easy to remove when the game is over.  The squares fill the entire board (which is about 10.25 inches square) which makes the game easier to read than the smaller traditional travel board.  The racks and bag are lightweight/chintzy but fine for their purpose.  This set does not come with score cards.

The tiles are much smaller than the original. Which, i guess, isn't a huge deal. My second issue, and it's the whole reason for this review, is that the ""tile lock"" feature, that is suppose to keep tiles in place, does not do this at all. It actually does quite the opposite. As you play Scrabble, you lay down your word onto the board. After placing your word, you go back and count your points. Most people, as far as i know, need to give each  tile a slight lift to see if there is a bonus spot under it. Well with this version, as you lift one tile, even in the slightest of ways, every other tile in line with that one gets pulled up too, only to completely jumble the word and make you have to reset the tiles again.

Everything is also plastic. The game title - Tile Lock Scrabble - is a bit misleading as the tiles don't actually snap or lock into place which what I envisioned. There's little pieces of plastic that protrude on all four corners of each letter space that prevent the tiles from sliding around and that's certainly handy but if you pick the board up, say to move to a different location, you've still gotta keep the board flat and steady, otherwise the tiles will fall out, they're not actually locked in. Overall, it does what it's suppose to as far as a Scrabble board can but not what I expected.",2.0

The ""locking"" devices are just cheap plastic nubs that stick up. The plastic that makes up the base and the nubs reminds me of the plastic frames that hold toy parts (the kind with which you twist the part to break the plastic and remove it).It is difficult to place the pieces in their spots, and If you accidentally bump the board, the pieces pop off. The letters are ugly plastic pieces.I looked at the website image again after receiving the item because I couldn't believe I hadn't noticed how poor the quality is.

5985,B01MR7O8ER,R3G51XQXZB6QOP,"I'm trying to reduce my collection of 250+ games, but I cannot when I MUST add this great game","  This is an abstract strategy game which reminded me in some ways of¬†

Gobblet

  ; in as much as it has that abstract strategy feel and a 3D feel...sort of. In reality, we like this one a lot better.THEME:> Since this is an abstract strategy game, the theme could have been anything, even the Greek gods that were selected.+ At the same time, the abilities of the gods in some cases are tied to the god's characteristics (Hermes can move fast), which adds a nice flavor to the game.COMPONENTS:+ The board is nice and thick.+ The base turns the board into an island, which is what Santorini is, an island.+ The figures are a solid plastic+ The buildings though light, yet still a solid plastic and should not break with normal use.> One recommendation is that level 1 and level 2 are often mixed up as players grab for the wrong pile, since the pieces look nearly identical when lying in multiple angles on the table. But if the levels were color coded that doesn't help color blind people, nor keep with the theme where all walls on a building are white-washed. Also, because everything is the same color it is easy for your eye to miss that winning spot and you miss out on winning or miss out on blocking the win. Thus the single color though frustrating could mean a lucky win because things can get missed.> The cards are over-sized which is fine.+ The cards have great artwork.-- The cards are a bit on the thin side. I didn't like handling them much because they don't feel like they are up to normal standards to me. But I can overlook this as you don't have to handle the card much during each game session.OTHER:+ The 3D aspect is great and forces you to turn the board around to get a different perspective and hopefully find a new strategy to whatever situation you are in.+ Each game or round, plays very fast. Our longest was 15-minutes and we played 10-games straight. Then again my son and I don't get analysis paralysis, so we aren't taking forever on our turn.TIP: If you play with a person who gets analysis paralysis grab the sand timer out of your Pictonary game you no longer play and use that to control how long each player gets; or use a timer on your phone.STRATEGY/LUCK:This is all strategy, no luck.Most of the game revolves around knowing when to or not to leverage your god's power.And/or baiting your opponent so you block them in somewhere.And/or making a wall by occupying spaces, so you can work on getting to Level 3, forcing the opponent to take a long way around and hopefully be too late to block.The only luck is in not missing an opportunity to win or block a win, since the buildings are all white from level 1, 2 and 3.The part I like best is how each god has a unique ability and requires a very different strategy to use the ability to win and/or block.OVERALL:Even the instructions say multiple times this is a 2-player game. Yes there are rules for 3 or 4 player, but it plays best as a 2-player.Yes 8+ can play this.The visuals and power variety make for a wonderful abstract strategy game.sidenote: Coincidently out of our first 15 games, whoever went 1st won 13 times.We are still testing this, because it doesn't feel like the 1st player has an advantage; it really is only coincidental.",5.0
5986,B01MR7O8ER,RW3JT8WUYP04O,"Great for everyone, from children to serious strategic gamers.","  I got this game for, and play it with, my 6 and 7 year old daughters. That's about the lower limit of ages to play it.There are two levels of play: basic rules and god powers. The basic rules alone would have been a great strategy game, the god powers add lots of variety; each god basically has a particular rule exception or bonus (movement, building, victory condition) variation from the basic rules, so you end up with hundreds and hundreds of possible matchups.The basic game is each player has two workers. Each turn you move one worker to any adjacent square (including diagonal) that is not occupied, not capped off, and not more than one level higher than her starting square; and then build in any square adjacent to the square she moved to. You can only build a level 1 block on an empty square, a level 2 block on a level 1 block, a level 3 block on a level 2 block, and you can cap off a level 3 block. To win, you must move one of your workers to a level three block on your turn (some god powers might have put you at level 3 in your build or on another player's turn; that is not a winning condition), or prevent your opponent from having any legal moves.Mechanically, the game is elegant. The rules are simple enough for a child to understand, the board is a simple 5x5 grid, the pieces you build with are simply three decreasing sizes of blocks, and caps. Yet it can be almost chess-like in depth.Components are very nice. There is an ""island"" base under the board which adds atmosphere but has no function during play. The building pieces are easily distinguished white and blue plastic and make a very attractive looking city. The players' worker figures (there are one male and one female, in blue/beige/grey for up to three players), are cute; you could paint them if you're good at that, but it's not necessary. The god power cards are large and thick cardboard. The basic rules are one page, perfectly clear; the god powers are described over two pages, and can sometimes be a little confusing.This version does not have the ocean ""mat"" under the island. But like the island base itself, that is a purely cosmetic bit that has nothing whatsoever to do with the gameplay.",5.0
5987,B01MR7O8ER,R3C0E3KTWNY10J,"A little ""better"" as a 2-Player game, but great gameplay and beautiful artwork","  While it IS a 2-4 player game, the instructions state that it is ""better"" played with just 2 players. I agree. There are 6 player pieces (""builders""), but when playing 2-player, you each select a SET of 2 same-colored pieces and you get to move one or the other during your turn. When playing 3 or 4 players, each player gets just one piece. So I wish it were more of a ""true"" 4 player game where no game play or pieces are sacrificed. It's simple game play as far as mechanics of building and goal to win, but there is certainly some strategy that young kids can start to pick up on. I've played a few times with my 6-year old and she's starting to think ahead now and plan her next couple of moves (including blocking me!), which is great. It's smart to follow the game instructions and play your first few games WITHOUT the God or Hero cards. Then add the basic cards into game play, and then finally the advanced cards (the basic and advanced cards are described in the instructions and on the cards themselves). Great quality game, nothing really for young kids to break. I play with my 6, 8, and 10 year old kids. Card artwork is awesome and there are small details on the plastic game pieces.",4.0
5988,B01MR7O8ER,R2FQC42SSFXBNT,"Quick To Learn, But Still Has So Much Depth!","  What stuck out to me with Santorini was how much is packed into this game that is relatively small and super easy to learn. Santorini legitimately took less than a minute to understand, yet there is so much critical thinking and strategy involved. I believe this concept for games that are quick and simple to learn, but still involve lots of strategy; get less attention among the hardcore board gamers today. This is a tragedy.Santorini is following one of the greatest game designs ever, one which more games should strive for. My one con in this game is that some characters may be a little overpowering (or weak) when combined with other characters. That being said, these are the aspects that make it so great:This game takes no time to learn, thus having virtually no barrier to entry for any audience.There are so many strategies and tactics, not only given the ways to build or hinder other builders, but also with the variety of character abilities.It's pretty cheap, but the pieces still appear so nice and create a very thematic experience.With all the character abilities and different strategies, it has a huge replay value.The design has a nice, cohesive theme, from the cartoony illustrations to the design of each level of the buildings.Moral of this story, go buy/play Santorini!",5.0

The quality of the components is good and parallels that of many of the other newer board games on the market that are considered to be hobbyist games. The plastic pieces are durable, well molded, and should last. The artwork has a fun, youthful chibi style.The manual is well done, and because the game is so simple, most of it is devoted to further unpacking the powers of the various God Power cards. The cards depict various gods and demigods of the Greek pantheon, and on of the nice features is that the powers they grant players match what that deity is known for, so Aphrodite would force the other player to always move next to one of your players, or the Minotaur would allow you to force an opponent‚Äôs Builder out of its space.PLAYWhile the game states it plays with people, it‚Äôs just teams of two. The more common player total is a head-to-head two. Three players is possible, but it‚Äôs a little more chaotic. Two players really is best.The goal is to move around the island board and construct the white and blue buildings the island of Santorini is known for. You call upon variable player powers granted you by the God Powers cards to use your skills to outwit the other player/team and get to the top of a three-story building first.The game is simple, with just two rules:While abiding by any special abilities your builder has been granted by the gods, move one of your builders into a neighboring space, either on the same level, one level up, or any number of levels down.Then build a building level immediately next to that builder you moved. On the third level, place a dome instead, which will prevent that space from being used..You win if you move one of your builders up to the third level.PRO+ Fast play+ Simple rules, but tough choices+ Teachable in just a couple minutes+ Looks beautiful as the town rises on the board, and will attract onlookers+ God Powers cards ensure no two games play alike, so plenty of replayability+ Appeals to a wide variety of players+ Great price and valueCON- Santorini is confrontational and has a screwage element to it that more sensitive gamers might not like- Unpacking and packing the game can take a little time because of the many pieces, but this is a quibbleEXPANSIONSantorini has an expansion that can be purchased, Golden Fleece, that adds more builder pieces, additional God Powers cards, new Hero Cards, the Ocean Board, and more. It‚Äôs a worthy upgrade for fans of the base game.SUMMARYSantorini is a new classic. Anyone looking for an alternative to chess, checkers, or other head-to-head game will find it an enjoyable choice.

This is why I love Santorini's cartoony take on the Greek gods. The artwork is truly outstanding: funny, diverse, and thoughtful (with nice touches like Hera with her iconic peacock, or LOL-worthy Eros in a hot tub).The components are great, mimicking the actual style of Santorini buildings (I was surprised that the blue domes are a real thing!). I also came to appreciate the plastic base, after I spilled water all over the table...the board didn't get wet =)  [side note: it looks like there are different editions, but I had no problems with this one] From the rules, to the artwork, to the materials, the game is well conceived and well designed at every level.

This keeps the game fresh no matter how many times you play.The basic rules are still a lot of fun, and my teenage son actually prefers when we play without god powers.

It reminds me of a kind of chess - not as complex as chess actually is, of course, but certainly more complicated than checkers. The different heights really add to the fun as well as the dimensionality (literally) of the game. If this game sounds like it's your type of thing, it probably is.

We have just started playing this but if you are looking for a game with a multitude of strategy options and great replay ability then this is the game. It play wonderfully with 2 or 3 and is always new every time we play. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a better than chess game with tons of options and a great look.,5.0
6011,B01MR7O8ER,R3VIFS2C4G592M,Super fun game that doesn't take too long to play.,"  This game is easy to learn, but takes some strategy as you go to win.  There are additional cards that give players abilities that change the game play significantly.We have only played 2-player games so far, but I look forward to trying with a third to see how much more challenging this is.Overall, we love this game and I would recommend it to anyone.",5.0
6012,B01MR7O8ER,R1XA7SNW54ZZEX,Fun game,"  This strategy game is great to plan with others. There's more than one way to play. So if you have little ones and think it maybe too hard, try the first way to play. We played it this way for a few times before using the cards. Best way to describe it is it's a fun way to play chess. You need to play one step ahead and figure where your opponent might go.  One round takes about 20 minutes for my family.",5.0
6013,B01MR7O8ER,R1CBBUF6ZJ5H7V,Boring,  I see that we‚Äôre in the minority but no one in my family likes this game. It seems kind of pointless.

6014,B01MR7O8ER,RQPTA55QO30WA,Poor Shipping,"  I had a couple of issues with the way the item was shipped.  The first is that the arrival date changed 3 times before it finally settled on a day.  I pay for Prime Shipping, I should be able to get an eligible item in two days because that's what I pay for.  The second issue was the way it was packaged.  The game box came damaged as all get out, with rips all over the outside.  Luckily, everything inside the box was okay, but the item only had one plastic packaging buffer, and was not secure at all. It's no wonder the thing came looking like it had been used for years before I finally got it.That all being said, the game itself is awesome.  Fans of abstract strategy are sure to like it, and it's very easy to learn and play.  Don't let the cover fool you, this isn't a game just for little kids.  Adults can enjoy it just as much if not more because of the strategy it takes to win.  If the shipping would have been better, 5 stars easy, but there is no excuse for why the arrival date changed, as well as why it came in such beat up condition.",1.0

Ordered this ahead of my wife and my babysitting our nieces (4 & 7 at the time) for a weekend. After a day of movies, iPads, and just all sorts of bouncing around, Candy Land provided the perfect change-up to reign in the attention spans without losing any of the day's excitement!  It was an entertaining pre-dinnertime activity that the girls had a blast playing as they did their best to embarrass their aunt/uncle in a race to the finish!My only knock was the fact that one of the pieces showed up already broken (see pic), but we made do.

I have such fond memories of this game, specifically the 60's-era edition gameboard we played on.When I had kids of my own, I wanted to continue the tradition of playing board games and spending quality focused family time together. Buying Candyland for my 3-year old seemed a logical first board game, except -- A friend brought over a copy of Candyland made a few years ago and I didnt even recognize the game. The board was flimsy and the graphics were not like I remembered. I was discouraged, until I stumbled upon this anniversary edition of the game. I ordered it and crossed my fingers.Well, when it arrived, playing this game took me back in time. My son picked up the basic rules pretty quickly and won tje first 3 times! It's funny how a simple graphic like the image of the floating ice cream slice or the gumdrop mountains can be so etched in ones brain, but while we were playing it was as if I had been transported back to 1978 and was sitting on my grandma's shag carpet next to the schnapps credenza.Whew! Candyland anniversary edition gives me nostalgia chills! Ok, back to business ---Pros -- sturdy, old-school style game board, easy-to-understand first game for ages 3 and up, instant nostalgia for older playersCons -- Gameboard may seem bland or dated to any adult players under 40, though very young kids probably won't even notice.",5.0

We've had so much fun playing it over and over and over..... I had this as a kid 60(?) years ago and loved it myself.  Played it by myself and showed my granddaughter this when no one was available to play. Red against blue or whatever.  She does this when I'm busy.  I can't remember if the pieces were like gingermen that came in this game or those ""hersey kiss"" shapes, but I can see how the gingermen could break.  So far so good.

Well, the game brought back good memories and my son enjoys playing.

Make sure to shuffle the cards well the first time!The game itself can get a little long-winded for a 3-year-old, especially when you draw a candy card that sends you way back to the beginning!

I find the new versions are sensory overload and some of the images in the new versions aren't appropriate for young kids.

However, instead of paying rent, utilities, etc., it appears all the activity centers around sweepstakes, lotteries, casino night, and jackpots. I don't really want to embed the idea of gambling in my kids, not that I'm a prude, but there are way too many people in our area who are addicted to it, and it is obviously not a reliable source of income, budgeting, or financial management, as I had hoped this game would teach. I don't think it's even the same manufacturer, the graphics are different, it is definitely NOT the ""classic edition."" I dislike it so much, I'm not even giving it to Goodwill, instead threw it in the trash. Seems moronic, given the financial crisis of 2008 that we don't produce a game that's fun and intelligent about finances.

This version of payday is updated and the money is in much larger bills instead of the original games $10's, $20's etc.  Also, you almost have to play this game using bank loans instead of cash.  In the original game, you could play without loaning money from the bank but now everything is too expensive so in order to purchase deals using cash only, you would need to play several months.  As a family, we enjoy that the original game can be played month by month with our kids and it teaches them budgeting and about bills.  The new version is more difficult for them because all of the money is in higher amounts.  I understand why they updated it but wish they still would have used $10's, $20's etc instead of $20,000.

6104,B00083HIJK,R36FY7VZRU72TQ,Tremendous fun!,"  Payday is a classic board game in which you spend each month (the board is designed as a calendar) buying and selling properties, paying bills, taking your chances with the lottery, and hoping to hit the jackpot before you retire.  It's refreshing to see that this game hasn't been ""modernized"" for the new generation ‚Äì which often mean overly simplified and devoid of much fun ‚Äì and remains the original, classic game that is tremendous fun for people of all ages to play.",5.0
6105,B00083HIJK,RJ7W5PCRLU8F5,Very disappointed in this game,  Very disappointed  in this game. I have the old version. It taught you about life. You paid bills which were very realistic. The new game is absolutely disgusting. It's promoting socialism.,1.0

Even my husband enjoyed playing and I think it's kind of a good lesson to teach kids the art of adulting lol (taking risks, having an income, getting bills, junk mail, etc lol)One weird thing that I do like is that the box is square and easier to store (not like the long rectangle boxes that don't fit on any shelves anywhere lol)",5.0
6107,B00083HIJK,R2TM5AEWG9GX7G,"Easy to learn, but still fun for a variety of ages.","  A small, easy to learn game that the kids get into. It brought back memories for me since I loved this game as a kid. The board and rules have been slightly modernized (I miss the old version), but the students in my Economics class liked it, and we tallied up net worth at the end. I liked that you can control the length (unlike Monopoly) by setting a certain number of months. I gave the winner of each team (I bought 3 games) a PayDay candy bar, so a nice tie in there!",5.0
6108,B00083HIJK,R2TFVK27YZT9QR,OK my kids love it. I do not,"  OK my kids love it. I do not! I think it puts too much on luck as most board games but ... there is room to add more weights to skills. For example, the creator of the game could make the selling and buying conditioned or negotiated and not automatic as it is now. Right now the game teaches the kids that taking risks and getting lucky is all you need. I would love it if the game teaches them taking risks, having skills in trading and little luck will make you successful.",4.0

After playing badminton outside, my grandsons tire while dad and uncle are still trying to beat each other.  So the kids come in to the house and we play board games until the cookout is ready.  Pay Day is the first new game we opened and they love it.  It's great that you can choose how many months you are going to play (so that it doesn't go on forever like Monopoly).  It exposes the children to paying bills, making a salary, paying off loans, computing interest and accumulating wealth.  So far the kids have won every game...there is something wrong with us grownups.",5.0
6110,B00083HIJK,R3K77LM1S69MM0,so you can range how long you would like to play,"  Box is smaller then appears in amazon photo but it's actually okay cause it takes up less space to store. I don't know what is up with the mail cards, I guess so you don't get bill after bill from that pile. But anyways, it was an enjoyable game to play. You can play several different months, so you can range how long you would like to play. Weather it be 30 minutes or longer. So that is nice, depending on your time limit or who your playing with. I've played with my nieces who are 8 and 5. The five year old got a little bored and quit but the 8 year old wanted to keep playing. We had played 4 months! My brother who I got this for also liked it a lot and the price I made was good! Probably the same if not cheaper then buying in-stores.",4.0

The game approaches life from a realistic bill standpoint and takes some time to appreciate.  My girls didn't like the first time we played...but after a few tweaks of our own, including how long to play and some slight side betting....it was perfect!  Give it a shot...cheaper than taking kids to the movies or eating out, and it's usable more than once:)",5.0

There are way too many spaces with lotteries and other sort of winnings, it makes it not even that exciting when you win the lottery because it happens so much. That being said, my children do love it, but I get annoyed playing it - it feels like the Vegas version or something. I've noticed a newer version at the stores that doesn't have so many lottery spaces, wish we'd purchased that one.",3.0
6115,B00083HIJK,R3ENZ76M1H4EL3,Not quite what I remembered,  Easy game...too easy. Noone ever gets behind on bills in the game though so the loan position isnt used.

6116,B00083HIJK,RM03XFBFPI5IE,Great Game,  I ordered this game as a collective Christmas present for my family. When my boys were growing up we had family game night every Friday. PayDay was our favorite. Over the years our old game fell apart and I searched for a new one and never could find one. So it was great to find this one on Amazon. It was easily ordered and shipped right away and arrived well packed. We played the game several times over the Holidays and all the parts were there. It was indeed a new never been opened game. The only reason I am not giving the full five stars is that the game board is a little warped. Not so bad that we could not play it just enough to be a little annoying.,4.0

6120,B00083HIJK,R2S8F57QH4L49I,New version not so much fun,"  Pay Day was in my top ten board games as a child.  Unfortunately, this version is different from what I played.  The colors are too loud and the board is hard to read.  The mail and deal cards are quite boring compared to the original.  Some of the pictures are the same, but most of them are very generic.  Some are modern and connote inappropriate things.  They removed the rule for rolling for commission, too.  I think more decorative cards and a toned-down board would improve the playing pleasure.",3.0

6122,B07CZ6TWG8,R5PXLLVTJGBN5,Makes Clue more enjoyable for the older crowd,"  When I was a kid my favorite board game was Clue. When I became an adult I thought my favorite board game was still Clue, but then I played it again with friends and finished the entire game in less than 10 minutes. It was too easy! Not enough variety to keep it going for a length of time that's fun and enjoyable.Enter Clue Master Detective! This game is identical to original Clue but with the added bonus of more rooms, weapons, and potential perpetrators. Same game dynamic as the original with a few small updates you have the option of including to add variety to the game.It's worth noting that, like regular Clue, the game is substantially more interesting if you have more players. You can kind of play this with two people but the difficulty is pretty low since you each start out with 50% of the cards.Overall though a really fun spinoff that's worth adding to your board game collection. I'd recommend this. Blessings!",5.0

6127,B07CZ6TWG8,R3KU8AYCQ6I3GY,Daughter loved it,"  This is just like original clue in most ways but more possibilities of who, what, and where the murder happened. We still play with two players because she's an only child and her dad works so much so it's often just me and her. We start off with one clue each, then we role the dice and whomever gets the highest roll gets a second clue to start with. With the rest of the clues we did it like the original clue two player option by leaving the clues in different rooms and collecting them as we enter. Since there are 24 cards left after this we do it either  6 rooms with 4 or 4 rooms with 6 cards. She prefers it this way even when her dad plays along because she likes the idea of potentially having more clues than other players by making it to the rooms before anyone else.",5.0
6128,B07CZ6TWG8,ROAGIZCE83LS6,YES!,"  Great game for the Clue masters ;) I like the extra characters, rooms and weapons! The game board is pretty and the characters are drawn nicely.

Figured this might be a fun replacement and I was totally right! We played it the night it came in and it was a blast for the whole family! The extra rooms, weapons and people made it take longer but it was just the extra oomph the traditional game needed to make game night more fun. I wish I had discovered this version years ago. I will be purchasing a copy for my house later this year for Christmas.",5.0
6131,B07CZ6TWG8,R1VOBXHT6U45O3,Had a wonderful time,"  This game has always been stressful to me; the race to figure it out before someone else does. It's even harder with the extra rooms because with 3 of them you have to travel through another room to get to them forcing you to end your turn before you can get to there. You have to go through the trophy room to get to the carriage house and go through the courtyard to get to either the gazebo or the fountain. Just that adds a little more stress to the race which i like. The character pieces' colors are easily identifiable and the weapons are enormous haha i've never used the weapons pieces ever in a game but they're cool to have (the horseshoe is as big as a quarter, i think) All in all great game~",5.0

Item shipped on the 11th, arrived in 3 shipping centers at varying times on the 12th, then no activity until it was checked in to another three on the 28th of May, then was checked in at a final location on the first of June, finally arriving today, June 2nd. I realize that with the currently evolving pandemic situation one cannot expect business as usual delivery, but taking so long that the Amazon app itself suggests asking for a refund because your package may be lost is a red flag for me. In addition, the package arrived very damaged in a bag similar to those used to ship books. As the photos attached should show (if I did everything correctly), the box was shrink wrapped as if it had come direct from the store shelves, which is why I am loathe to blame this all on the supplier, but there were clearly major errors that occurred during shipping. The game board is playable, albeit bent in a way that makes it impossible to place flat on a tabletop. The product itself appears to be an officially licensed Hasbro game, which is surprising since I‚Äôve never heard of it. Nevertheless, due to the delivery state of the package, shipped by ‚ÄúNewgistics‚Äù according to the amazon app, I have requested either a return or refund from the supplier.",2.0

It seemed to the group of 4 adults playing the game, that quality control needed to be improved.  But, please don't get me wrong, this was a fun game to play.",3.0

Super nice and heavy.  Plenty of detective notebook paper for many, many games.There are small pictures of magnifying glasses on the board.

But really, it's very fun, like an 80's version of the game, with super punny character descriptions and solid gameplay. I'm not crazy about some of the naming conventions for the added characters, but as the original game was created in 1947, I doubt the geniuses that came up with Colonel Mustard and Mrs. Peacock were still in employ (at least I hope they've had the opportunity to retire and live off of their Clue riches).",5.0

Overall, we love how this board and all its pieces can be played like the classic game. But, we've been playing the full Master Detective version since we got it. Quality of the board is great.

6152,B082QSZ69K,R1HJ9G8J1AEOHJ,"Not quite the original, but still excellent!","  First, ""Detective: A Modern Crime Board Game"" is one of my favorite gaming experiences. My game group has had many enjoyable hours with that game. ""Season One"" is a follow-on (not an expansion but a separate stand-alone game) that aims to keep the momentum going.I will always be a fan of Detective and will play every new case that is released. That said, Season One doesn't quite hold up to the original (this is only based on one completed case, however). The case was excellent and the challenge was just right, but Season One is a slight step down from the original in the following ways (all just my opinion): ‚Ä¢ Our game nights last around 3 hours, so the original cases were just right (2.5 to 3h each). The Season One case we did felt short at 90 minutes - we all longed for about a half hour more of entertainment. I expect case 2 and 3 will be similar. ‚Ä¢ Why ""dumb it down"" and lose the different skill tokens, character skills, authority tokens, and stress levels? Perhaps the thinking was that these mechanics took something away from solving the cases. Those elements, however, added some strategy to the game and we really enjoyed the added tension (especially when to use an authority token or take on stress with overtime). The characters also meant something with their different capabilities, but in Season One they are simply well-presented eye candy. ‚Ä¢ Stand-alone cases are fine, but we really enjoyed the campaign in the original. The continuing story was well done and kept us engaged. That said, I completely understand while stand-alone cases are beneficial, particularly for a changing group of players, so I wouldn't deduct any stars for that. ‚Ä¢ I liked the interview mechanic from Dig Deeper and was hoping to see that reused here for at least one case.The Antares database was excellent, as usual, so glad that remains. The story was also very well crafted, and although the timeframe (22 hours of game time) was short, we still managed to determine the reason for the crime and how it was committed, although we guessed wrong at the culprit. A bit more game time and I am convinced we would have pieced it together.In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend Season One although I enjoyed the original just a bit more.",5.0

I had one as a child and got this for my kids. The one I got must have just been defective.",1.0
6163,B01NALEP04,R1EHHMTVCY5SMB,Fun game that also helps with memory skills,  This game is more expensive on here than in stores but the stores have been sold out so I bought it anyway. I didn‚Äôt have any problems with missing pieces or the timer going faster. I bought this for fun game time with my son but to also help his memory skills. Ever since he‚Äôs been playing this regularly his memory has improved significantly. Before he had trouble remembering important school information but this game helps to stimulate his brain so it‚Äôs worth the buy for young kids,5.0
6164,B01NALEP04,RSAE7N2QKCLWT,Timer is off,"  Bought this for Christmas for our kids...I tried playing the first round and couldn't get all the pieces in before it popped.  Then we tried again and it turns out the tray pops up after about 30 seconds, not 60 like it's supposed to.  I was going to get one at Target and tested it to make sure it worked, but that one was off too, popping up after only 40 seconds.  This seems to be a common issue.  Hopefully Hasbro looks into this and fixes it.",1.0
6165,B01NALEP04,RCPU8RUFHGTC9,STILL MADE STRONG unlike some others...,"  I LOVE this game for kids!!!  I remember purchasing this game when my kids were little, they are in their mid 30s now, and they loved it.I was a bit hesitant about purchasing it because it seems that most of the games I buy NOW as gifts for young children are not made as durable or lasting as the same games were made 29 years ago.But this one did not disappoint!!!It‚Äôs still as sturdy as ever!!!I purchased it as a birthday gift for a four year old knowing that his 3 year old sister and his young cousins would be playing it and be kind of rough in it.But it has held strong!!!It‚Äôs a perfect gift for even younger children if you play it without the timer so they can work on recognition and hand eye coordination skills.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",5.0

6167,B01NALEP04,R18T7U2VT9SYX7,Nervous children beware! (Nervous adults watch out!),"  This game requires much practice to be able to insert all the shapes within 1 minute.  The timer ticks LOUDLY--which creates great excitement (but also causes anxiety for nervous types.) :-)One nice feature is being able to play the game solo. That allows the player to gradually memorize (at his or her own pace) where each shape belongs, and--eventually--to achieve PERFECTION!Another helpful feature is the built-in compartment for storing all the game pieces (shapes).The age range (5 years and up) may be unrealistic for most children (and many adults) until each has practiced A LOT! On the other hand, you may discover that you have a little genius in the family !Playing this game is a also great way to improve eye-hand coordination.I gave it only a three because the children to whom I gave it (girls age 5 and 8) said it is disappointingly difficult to master.  I'm certain there are children (very competitive and detail oriented) who would enjoy this game more.",3.0

There are not a lot of games on the market that an only child can play, but this on is great for those single child households.  One of my favorite things is the game is easy to store, you can keep it in the box it was packaged in or not. The bottom of the game has a storage compartment that all the little pieces fit into when not in use. The unit itself is shaped somewhat like a box, so it's flat on the top and bottom which is awesome as well so you can stack it with board games. No assembly required.",5.0

The timer knob feels like it's going to snap every time you twist it. When you push the tray down, you can tell that it's going to stop working soon when a plastic piece inside probably will break off. Total landfill fodder. THEN I unpacked the pieces and discovered that there are doubles of half of the pieces and zero of the other half.  So we can't even play the game. Great.

She had so much fun & did really well remembering where the hidden colors were. Her only comment was that these looked like carrots and not radishes (which I agree with). She also chose not to use the hourglass timer‚Äîso I would say that‚Äôs optional to play with. From a parents point of view, I think the game is a super cute concept and fun to play. I would say that the pieces do not stand up straight and that makes it a bit hard to remember where pieces are. Other than that, fun memory game for kids. Best suited for 3-6 years.",5.0
6250,B000REQRAG,R2BNM3ZKAIRZDC,"We so wanted to love this, but don‚Äôt.","  My daughter loves this game on the tv, so i bought It so we could experience the fun of playing it together.  Whilst the actual game works, the quality of the pieces just do not.  For example, the ‚Äúletter wall‚Äù covered spaces fall down consistently, the lines that illustrate that that door is in play or not does not line up.  Lastly you have to slide the game sheet into the letter wall, and because you are trying to hold all the doors up, you see the phrase as you are sliding the sheet in.I am a believer in playing traditional games with my daughter and, although she plays on the iPad as well, i want her to play games socially with us, but unfortunately this is one game that doesn‚Äôt work as a board game, but would be much better suited on an iPad.",1.0
6251,B000REQRAG,R83J2PFU3RNCZ,Decent but frustrating in some ways.,"  The puzzle cards have random letters in between the puzzle answers so that it's not easy to read what the answers are as you slide them into place. The random letters have a blue line under them to is supposed to show in the display area so you know those spaces aren't used. While I understand the logic of doing it this way, there has to be a better way! The blue lines aren't always visible and it's very difficult to solve a puzzle that you can't tell exactly how many letters are supposed to be used per word.We've played the game a few times as a family, but the novelty wore off quickly.

6310,B004BW8TYC,R17OD8858DUNI4,Very simple game - and that is what it needs to be.,"  This is a very simple game which is perfect for 2 year olds.  Seriously, it is very hard to find a game so simple that even a 2-year old can understand and enjoy it.  I had avoided getting this game because of all the ""simple"" comments, but I am SOOO glad I ignored them because its what I needed for my little one.Not only is it the perfect age range, but the game is collaborative so all the players are working together towards the same goal.  This collaborative format works much better with the very young children as it is hard for them to play games individually.  It also is helpful to share the winning and losing as a team as it helps process the emotions of it as a group instead of alone.Set up - Set out four trees.  Place the same 4 wooden fruits on the same tree (plums tress only bear plums).  Each tree in the orchard now bears 3-D wooden fruit... and each fruit is a different color:  green apples, red apples, yellow pears, and purple plums.  Put together the pathway to the orchard (place the given tiles in a row).  Place the raven at the start of the path.Purpose of the game - The raven will hop down the pathway to the orchard and when he arrives, the raven will eat ALL the fruit on the trees.  To win the game, players must collect the fruit before the raven gets there.Game play - Roll the die and see what color is on top of the die.  Pick the fruit of that color and place in the basket.  If a basket image shows up on top, collect any colored fruit you want to put in the basket.  If the raven shows up on top, hop the raven one space closer to the orchard.  If you roll a color and there is none of that colored fruit left to pick off trees, then pass the die to the next player.Teaches - taking turns, following directions, color matching, counting 1-8 (ex: by counting 8 apples and spaces the raven hops), processing emotions of win/lose, and some basic science concepts:1.  fruit comes from plants2.  apples, pears, and plums grow on trees3.  farm that grows fruit on trees is called an orchard4.  birds eat fruit5.  each tree only bears one kind of fruit (pears and apples do not come from the same tree)The fact that this game could so easily be connected to a basic science lesson on where food comes from was really such an amazing surprise!  This game could easily be added into a 2-year old basic curriculum.  Heck why not add in a mini outing to pick apples or cheeries at a local orchard?Overall, I am thrilled with this game.  Quality, well throught through, and more learning opportunities than I even expected!  Even after my children outgrow this game, the fruit could even used in other ways because they are so well made.  Haba just won over my lifelong business.",5.0
6311,B004BW8TYC,REBE8DXYBD7C9,Old Crow Colorful Fruit Show,"  My wife and I have played board games for many years and have a decent size library (~100+) ranging from deck builders to worker placement. I was looking for something to try and get my 2 year old son interested in the hobby at a relatively early age and this seemed to fit the niche quite nicely.Overview: The game is very simple. A bird is attempting to get in the orchard. There are several trees in the orchard with fruit on them. We want to get the fruit before the bird gets into the orchard. On a turn the player rolls a dice that has three types of results: color (fruit), bird, basket (wild). If a color is rolled you pick the associated fruit. If the bird is rolled the bird moves one space closer to the orchard. If a basket is rolled you can pick a fruit of any type.Components: Haba components are always top notch. The fruit pieces are hefty. The dice is large and easy to handle. My son loves birds so the bird figure is a nice touch.Gameplay: It's all about learning. During our play we call out the color on the dice and the associated fruit. The child gets the opportunity to fine tune some motor skills by rolling the dice and placing fruit in the basket. Learning the steps of a turn reinforces routine and also helps the child learn to take turns.Overall this is a great game for younger kids (~2-4). It is brilliantly simple for the educational value it provides. Just be mindful that a child at this age may not be ready or interested in a game. My son and I have only played this a few times, but I will continue inviting him to play and will continue to accrue games for his age range as he grows because it is a hobby I enjoy.",5.0
6312,B004BW8TYC,R1SQ4JBPPS4Q0C,Teamwork for all ages!,"  My children are 6 years, 3 years and 20 months. This game is perfect: easy to learn, inclusive of all family members (no matter the age) and all about teamwork. What is not to love?! I worried that this would be too simplistic for my 6 year old but was happy to discover even my husband enjoyed playing. I love how it is all about teamwork. Our family against the raven! The first time we played we only rolled one raven and I was a little disappointed that the game was so easy. But it really was just all about chance. Because the next three times my kids played they lost to the raven. Part of the reason being my son it not very adapt at rolling the dice. This game is wonderful for going over colors, waiting your turn and promoting sibling camaraderie. Since the cube has six sides there is one color dot for each of the fruit, a basket to select which ever color the child desires and then one side is the raven. I just love how this is all about cooperation and teamwork. No fighting about who gets to be which character or color with this game.",5.0
6313,B004BW8TYC,R1OO2FDSD9QQOV,"Ages 2-4, BUY IT","  I'm an avid board gamer myself, I've been looking at some early games to introduce to my just-turned-13 daughter. I had picked up a few like Pengaloo (bit too old for multiple actions in a turn), and Go Away Monster (more fun as a toy than a game). My mother in law got her Chutes and Ladders which she was understandably bored with after 3 minutes.  Then came First Orchard...She picked this game up within seconds, the idea of just rolling a die, pick the fruit, next person's turn. She became obsessed with it. The first day I gifted it to her, we played it 14 times in a row, then she went and got her Mommy, taught her the game, played it another 4 times. That night she taught it to her Grandmother and played it another dozen times. The following morning she woke up, got the game off the shelf and brought it to me. It's been a week and we're still playing it 2-4 times a day. I don't even mind because she loves to set it up herself, games only take 5 minutes, it's great.Everyone should have this game, honestly. It teaches about taking turns, can be a learning tool for color and pattern recognition, counting, winning and losing.My daughter always wants to win, and I have to convince her to not cheat sometimes, but after we win, she always gives the crow a fruit or two afterwards as a consolation. <3",5.0
6314,B004BW8TYC,R1BEU6H8HIL71,Fruitastic game!,"  We got this game because our 2 year old always wanted to join when we played games but they were too advanced. This has been a great game that our entire family enjoys! It's very simple with large pieces and quick game play, all of which are a must with the short attention spans of little ones! Our kiddos enjoy throwing the die and trying to keep the birdie from eating the fruit. When the bird comes up on the die, they giggle and say don't get our fruit! It's been great because it also teaches lessons that games do, such as waiting our turn, playing the color rolled even if it's not the one that was wanted (and thus not cheating), and that we don't always win but we can play and try once more. This game is a winner all around and is played weekly.Update: After having this game for over 2 years it's been one of the most played with games that we have in our big collection of games! Kiddos ranging from 22 months up to 5 years enjoy it and so do the adults who play it with them. The game looks as great as it did when we got it. The fruit pieces have hit the ground more times than I can say but they haven't chipped at all. This game has been so durable and such fun to have in our rotation. One thing to keep in mind is that the pieces are made of wood so they pack a punch if hurled by a little one but we haven't really had a problem with that since the game play is so quick and keeps the kids engaged. I still love how big the pieces are because they can't be choked on, are easy for kids to grasp, and I'm not picking up tiny pieces everywhere! One of the other reasons this game is uniquely awesome is because it takes very little effort (not a lot of rules) but it's still fun so you can get straight into playing & having fun. Also everything fits in the box well and the box has held up just as well as the rest of the pieces. It's just a really great game!!",5.0
6315,B004BW8TYC,R134A18SB1AR4C,A great game for the entire family!,"  This game is amazing. I played it with my son who is 2.5 years old and he wanted to play it again 5 times in a row. The pieces are beautiful, the rules are simple and the game is not competitive - you are playing against the raven trying to get to your orchard before you pick all the fruit. If the raven gets there first, everyone loses together. If you pick all the fruit first, everyone wins. I look forward to playing it as a whole family, with our son's Grandma and Daddy - you can have up to 4 players. I think we are now hooked on Haba's toys.",5.0
6316,B004BW8TYC,R3KW0SCYYX2SDJ,Much better than I anticipated,"  I am so happy with this game! It looked like fun and had good reviews so I bought it for my 2-year olds birthday a couple of days ago.The pieces looked pretty tiny on the box as the only reference is a die and I thought it was a regular sized die. When the game arrived it was a jumbo-die so everything was much bigger (and better!) than I expected.Big, durable wooden pieces, educational and fun. My daughter loves it. She helps me set it up and matches the fruit up with the color on the die. I am not sure has understood the concept of the bird coming to eat the fruit if it makes it all the way, but that will come I am sure.Main thing is we are having fun and she is learning colors, turn play, etc.",5.0
6317,B004BW8TYC,R2XP88UJ6JDKYH,Well Made and Cute!,  I got this for my daughter's 3 year birthday and she loves it! I can tell that she would have understood the concept even 6 months ago because it's an easy game to learn.It's so well made... I know it'll last through all my kiddos. AND one of the main reasons I got is is because it didn't have any choking hazard pieces. I have a baby and I know we want more so not having to worry about small pieces is a big plus in this household. And when my eldest daughter isn't playing with it my baby loves the big pieces. =)Super cute and a great family game. I can just see my 2 girls playing with it together when they're a bit older. =),5.0
6318,B004BW8TYC,R34NI5282IY1BO,The perfect SIMPLE game for a young child.,"  I am a retired Kindergarten teacher, and part of my benchmark that a first game must have is engagement, strategy, and flexibility --especially when dealing with a 2-3 year old child.  This exceeded my expectations!  My early three year old grand daughter loved the hand sized wooden fruit in the orchard, that had subtle hints as to which fruit goes on the tree -- so sorting / matching was an option but not a requirement.  The size of the game pieces made it perfect for reassurance that her little sister was not at risk if a game piece was misplaced temporarily.  The die had each of four colors, the dreaded raven on one side, and a basket on the sixth side which allowed the players to choose which of the four fruits needed to be chosen.  You could make the game harder by making the raven's path smaller, and the child could be responsible for moving all the fruit into the basket (which at first is all she wanted to do)  Later, she got the game out and started playing by herself against the raven --  something that most games don't have an option for ....solo play.  All in all I HIGHLY recommend this game and will be looking for more HABA games.  One more thing -- this is a super sturdy game -- which is why I gave it five stars for value for money.  It will be one that you will save for when this child has their own children.",5.0
6319,B004BW8TYC,RX46RPM1EJGLI,Exceptional Toddler Board Game!,"  My 2-year-old and 4-year-old love this game! I'm a huge fan of board games with manipulatives for this age range. Also, the objective of the game is clear--pick the fruit before the bird gets there!--and engages and excites my kids more than the ambiguous objectives/concepts of a lot of other games. The cherry on top: we're all working together toward a common goal! HIGHLY recommend!",5.0
6320,B004BW8TYC,R1C9SA3UDCDHKS,... is autistic and we thought this would be a good choice to start teaching him about taking turns,"  My 3 year old is autistic and we thought this would be a good choice to start teaching him about taking turns.  So far, he seems to enjoying throwing the fruit more than playing with it.  We have been able to use the fruit to help identify colors and basic color sorting.  The pieces have held up well despite multiple throws.  I think the game probably is better for 3-4 year olds.  It does appear to be a good game for young kids, mine is just not quite ready yet.",4.0
6321,B004BW8TYC,R2R5WSRW16LR0P,"Simple but engaging, and toddler safe","  My son loves this game. He is almost two, and has asked to play this game every day since we bought it. He needed a little guidance at first, but is quickly grasping the concepts of turn taking and following rules of game play according to dice rolls.The pieces are appropriately sized for a toddler too. While I don‚Äôt doubt my son could manage gameplay with smaller pieces, and rarely mouths objects now, I am still uncomfortable allowing him to get used to playing with something I could not let him play with unsupervised. This, though, I could let him play independently without concern for choking (or losing pieces!) This was the main reason we had not introduced other common preschool games, despite other signs of readiness and interest in our board games.Also, the solid wood pieces are lovely, as are the illustrated tiles, which make it a joy to play with.",5.0
6322,B004BW8TYC,R3VFEY0HFEXF19,Great cooperative game for very young kids,"  I picked this up for my 3- and 1-year-old nephews‚Äô birthday party.  It arrived in good condition, still sealed, with all pieces inside.  During the party, I test-played it with two other experienced adult board gamers.The box includes (16) large plastic fruit in (4) colors, (4) tree mats, a wooden raven, a large 6-sided die, and (4) cardboard track tiles and an orchard tile.  My nephews loved grabbing the fruit and struggled to fit any pieces in their mouths.To set up, place all fruit of each color on the appropriate tree.  Set up the (4) track tiles so they are leading to the orchard tile, and then put the raven at the start.  Your goal is to work together to harvest all of the fruit before the raven reaches the orchard and steals it.The first player is the one who last ate an apple.  The player rolls the die.  If it lands on a colored square, the player harvests that color fruit; if there is no fruit left of that color, nothing happens.  If it lands on a basket, the player can harvest any fruit.  If it lands on the raven, then the raven advances down the track.  It‚Äôs a game of pure luck, and my group of gamers almost lost.It‚Äôs very simple, but encourages cooperation and listening to rules.  Highly recommend for young kids.",5.0
6323,B004BW8TYC,RO9PS6ZAD7V8X,Excellent way to introduce toddlers to family game night!,"  Quality constructed game, and appropriate for young children. My 2 year old will usually play one round without losing interest, and while the simple rules mean it‚Äôs not challenging for the rest of us, the game moves fast enough that we don‚Äôt mind playing at all.  She loves the raven, though, so she likes to move it more than we have to based on the die rolls. She also tries to sneak extra fruit into the basket every chance she gets. :) She does like to play with the pieces, so I have to keep her from sneaking the fruit into her shopping cart with her other play food!",5.0
6324,B004BW8TYC,R1P0VVGXY5YQPO,Best Beginners game for toddlers!,"  This game has become my kids favorite (they‚Äôre 2 & 3yo) and they both love and understand how to play.  Both my husband and I enjoyed playing with them as well. And my 3yo plays alone sometimes too. The pieces look very good quality too, and we like the fact that we as a family play against the bird not against each other which is still a hard concept for little kids to understand. It‚Äôs also so easy that we can play fast which also helps my son that has very short attention spam lol. Very happy with it!",5.0
6325,B004BW8TYC,RWKJ9DGW8XGL7,Excellent German quality!,  I bought this for my grandson's 2nd birthday and he was very excited about it.  The ONLY thing I didn't like was it is a first game for little ones but there are no losers.  Everyone wins. As a grandma born in 1954 I don't like that.  I raised my kids to take their lumps at an early age and they have been  the better for it.  That's not grandma being mean.  It just helps kids to learn that you can have fun but in real life you lose once in a while.  And that's not a bad thing.,4.0
6326,B004BW8TYC,R1O3JX8QLXTFBZ,Great for toddlers and can be repurposed for other games or used as food toys,"  The fruit, bird, and die are crafted out of wood and really high quality. I'm very satisfied with their paint and appearance. The die is big enough for a toddler to grab and it rolls really well with the rounded corners, avoiding any chance of poking somebody in the eye. Later, when the kid is too old for the game anymore, the pieces can be repurposed for other activities or games. This set will live on even after it's primary use as a game has worn out. Or, it's great enough to pass on to the grand kids once your little one has kids of her own. That can't be said for many toddler games since they take such a beating.",5.0
6327,B004BW8TYC,R3OIHARL5DRWJK,""" with great hilarity. The game","  I bought this for my 2 1/2 year-old granddaughter, wondering whether someone that young could actually play a board game. She loves it! At first, when she rolled the die and the crow turned up, she was scared (because the bird threatened to eat the fruit in the orchard). But then getting the crow turned out to be a real Event! Every time she rolls the die and gets the crow, she cries out ""Stinky Bird!"" with great hilarity. The game, at least in our household, is now called Stinky Bird. Two of her friends came over to play it with her; as a result, their parents also bought the game. I like it because it's well made--the fruit are made of wood instead of plastic. Great buy.",5.0

I realize that you could easily make something similar..but this game is so well made and cute, that I would highly recommend. My two year old got it today, and she already had us play several times.If you have a two year old, I'd suggest shelling out the $ and getting this game. The pieces are cute and well made. They are all made from wood and painted. The cards are sturdy and don't feel cheap.I like this so much that I'm searching now for other HABA toys and games! :)",5.0

The way I taught her was her sitting in her feeding chair no TV just me playing all by myself all happy and loud while teaching her. Look look I'm rolling the dice wow I got red that means I can put the red apple in the basket none for you crow. üòä After one game of showing her I gave her the dice and brought the fruit for her to choose only 2 at a time because it'll be easier for her to understand.

I think this is probably Haba's fault but the crate that holds the fruit came severely dented in my copy because the wooden fruit pieces were loose (not bagged) in the box and must have dented the cardboard. Lovely game but would be nice if more care was taken with packaging, especially since it was a present.",3.0
6335,B004BW8TYC,R31FVBKD5GWQTT,Perfect First Game,"  We got this game for my son for his second birthday. At first he had fun just sorting out the colors and setting up the game, but he couldn't really understand/wasn't interested in the rules. It did not take long for him to develop and want to play the game properly. We have other games that are more complex but like most 2 year olds he gets easily frustrated by them and does not want to play, First Orchard is appropriate for his stage of development and he enjoys playing it with us.  It has been great for color recognition, teaching him patience, turn taking, and rule following.

This game is wonderful! I love that its a collaborative game rather than a ""one person wins-everyone else loses"" type of game.

Its simple and helps with color recognition, even if your child already knows colors like our daughter she still LOVES this game and we currently have played it nearly everyday usually multiple times.",5.0

I found this one and decided to order it after reading some reviews. I am so glad I did. we don't follow the exact rules since he is still too young for it but we use the dice and baskets to sort the fruit. The quality is amazing.

There is no trickery, dishonesty, or bait and switch involved. It delivers exactly what it promises.Unfortunately, the final result reads like research notes. Research notes that would make a fantastic long article, but not a book.The problem is that each designer speaks to the reader fresh. That may not seem like a problem, but imagine sitting lesson one of the same class, as taught by many many different teachers. Still never getting to lesson two.It would be great if each designer had read what was written so far, so they could add to, dispute, or build on what was taught so far.However, having met some of these people personally (I skipped to their chapters first) I know they are very busy people, so involving them that much in the writing process would not have been possible.If I were writing this, I would write a chapter on each question, first by reordering the answers, next by deleting the repetition, then rearranging them into a more flowing order, then finally rewriting each sentence into a unified tone.Deleting the repetition will cut down on the bulk of this book, but so much the better. If I could read a long article and get the same content out that I have by completing this book, that would be the best article ever.Going in I thought ""if I hear the same advice twice, great!

How in the hell do you have the idea, cultivate it, evolve it, pitch it, get it published, and make a profit? All of those are not answered in this book. Some of those skills aren't taught here or anywhere, for that matter. And that's okay. But you need to know what you're getting with ""Board Game Design Advice."" So what is that?You're getting one of the very best springboards into design mentality.Your'e getting a phase one in to finding your zone.You're getting a starting pistol shot in a foot race of lots of failures.But from those failures, you can succeed in the end. You will fall, but you can rise, as well. It's like what Alfred said to Bruce Wayne. There are inspiring insights you'll get from this book, but they are not going to supply you with the disciplined time you MUST give to playtest, playtest, playtest the hell out of your projects with various other designers and blind playtesters. You will have your ego bruised. Get up. You will rewrite rules and ultimately bury many of your various games. Get up. Almost all of your designs will never be produced. Get up. You need to understand that from the beginning -- you will get knocked down. ""And why do we fall, Bruce?""Between this book, which does feel like a collection of blog interviews, in tandem with ""Fail Faster: a Playtesting Journal"" by Jay Cormier, you will be better equipped to design something fun that strangers actually want to play, and despite my lukewarm description of the book, that still puts you up on a better footing than 99 out of 100 other people trying to do the same thing you're doing without the right resources and mindset. What are we ultimately trying to do here? Become Givers of Fun.Play everything. EVERYTHING. Think of themes outside the box. Be open-minded. Learn new mechanisms constantly. Take walks. Travel. Read novels. Exercise and eat right. And whatever you do, make time every single day to play, design, or reflect. And read books like this one and Fail Faster. Cheers. 4/5",4.0
6419,B07FSW7JLC,RRV77EHP329AF,Insights from the Best in the Business,"  When I bought this, I bought it for the title alone. Little did I know it had contributions by more game designers than I could have hoped for!  I've enjoyed reading the different answers to different designers but also finding the common themes they recommend. Each has its own personality written into their answers as well. My favorite answers to questions are the best purchase under $50, for it gives great, cheap ideas on designing prototypes for your own games or other resources in helping you take your idea from your head into reality.The main criticism of other reviews seems to be the repetitiveness of it.  This may be a valid concern if it doesn't appeal to you, but in my opinion, it does just as much good. Reinforcing the ideas that many designers put forth is a good thing to have. And despite that, there are enough unique answers to every question that provides a little more insight into how these designers differ in their own philosophy of life and game design.",5.0

Unfortunately it was very dissapointing. There is really no point to the game. You are to match herbs up with their ailment as you and the rest of the players work your way up the mountain. There is no consequence for not having an herb match an ailment and no winner. I thought originally that as a group you all are racing against the board but it was way too easy. This game is severily boring and lacks the educational aspect that the description promised. The herb and ailment cards would suit better as a matching game. At least there would be some sort of challenge by guessing card placement.,1.0

Along the way they gather helpful plants which they can use in case of trouble like bee stings, hunger, sunburn, etc.  They can use a cooperation card and help one another if they have the right plant or to bring another player up to the same place on the mountain with them.

You have a problem card, and then you have herb cards you can use to remedy the problem, ie a scraped knee or a bee sting.

The cooperation cards were hard to get the gist of at first, but now its easy. One of my children uses them to catch me up all the time. I like this game. We used identification cards and books about plants to further our study. I want my children to learn the art of wild crafting and this is a fun way to introduce or re-engage the concept.",5.0

It's not competitive since you all work together to make it to and back from the huckleberry patch. I only give it four stars for two reasons. One because I see how you could play this game without it having any educational benefit - if you get a ""trouble card"" and hurriedly match an herb to one of the pictures on the card without reading the names or anything then you wouldn't learn. Secondly because the trouble cards actually end up being one, if not the biggest, help to advancing which doesn't make much sense. You get a trouble card and when an herb ""heals"" the trouble (mosquito bite, scrapped knee, hungry, etc) then you go to the next rest space, which could advance you quite a bit. This rule could easily be changed if desired, though it hasn't bothered me enough to actually change. Overall, it is great and I love when my kids ask to play ""Huckleberry Patch""!",4.0

Great at teaching about the principles of using natural plants for healing. The artwork is beautiful and it's all so well put together! The only thing I wish they would add is a card for EACH herb just for information so you can have a compilation for quick go-to when you have an ailment.

Obviously marshmallow was an important one for them to recognize ü§£. It's a bit long for the age group, but we just play with the goal of reaching huckleberry hill, and don't attempt to return home.  I absolutely loved the pdf book you could download to go with the game (found on their website) and I hope to get some of the fairy books also made by this company for their Christmas or birthday presents this year.

6445,B001M9JD9W,R2UJMZOA2724KB,Missing key aspects,"  This game could be really good.  I really like the concept, but they really messed up with not printing out the key components to the game.  When you play with what comes in the box, it takes all the learning out of the game.  You do not learn about any of the herbs except that they counter some ailment you have by matching pictures.  If you actually want to learn about the story of the game or the actual herbs you have to print out over 60 pages on your home printer.  What????  My kids kept asking questions and I had to say wait and look it up on the website or say I would print it for next time.  The whole point of a board game is to get off screens and learn about what plants help you in nature.  It was so frustrating and pointless the way it comes.  I did finally print out the info. you can download on the website and it's good, but for over $30 I felt really ripped off.  I would not recommend this game until the key info is actually included in what you buy.",1.0

The best thing was that we didn't play against each other. We had to work as a team to play against the board. This is the first time I have played a board game that encouraged you to help each other (and I adore this part of it)! He was kind and helpful instead of competitive and sneaky. That's the kind of world I would love to live in... one full of kind and helpful people. If you're interested, get the story book and pocket guide too (they are printable PDFs).

The purple spaces we simply omitted reading the story. This game takes about an hour with children under 10. But when the adults played a round they enjoyed themselves too.I like how the game gives detailed pictures and a reason for the kids to learn the pictures and names to cure. It doesn‚Äôt overwhelm them with how and which part which would be too detailed and confusing. If the kids can‚Äôt read well, they can match the pictures. Everyone is playing against the sun.

This game will not teach the how-to aspect of medicinal herb application but it familiarizes kids with plants quickly and gives an excellent base to build on. It encourages problem solving, cooperation, and an appreciation for plants. Honestly if this game went into much more detail it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable.As a little bonus the game we recieved was very well made.

The complete instructions on how to use the herbs for ailments is not included, as this is not a game for medicinal purposes.

Best for last, to win the family, each person, had to think of all the other players, aiding them with the plant curing cards as the game progresses with the object being EVERYONE has to reach the end before its game over!

Great idea and concept, but It's very basic and simple, and we were hoping for more of a challenge as adults.

When we use a plant card on this game we find the plant in our other decks of cards and read all we can on it. Just helps by giving a fuller description, edible parts, how to prepare, what type of nutrients/vitamins are in them, etc. The game doesn't go into details other than photo names and possible uses for the plant.

I loved the reunions of characters, and joining of others that had not met prior to this season. This show is so well put together and the build up was perfect. I also just finished the Conquest and Rebellion which was an animated history of Westeros since the conquest of Aegon Targaryen, and I thought it was put together very well. I loved that they used the actors of GOT to narrate the story behind the conquest of each kingdom. A great addition for people who may have not read the books and may be somewhat confused about the background of the show.

This special review is for ""Game of Thrones: S7 Conquest&Rebellion, Standard Edition, Blu-ray"".I want to be very specific about that because there are already a number of different versions that have been released.  This is for a version that works with NTSC players in the United States!I have received my 'like-new' copy of this specific edition and noticed that it has the dubbed-in VOCAL tracks in English, French, German, Italian, and Japanese, plus subtitles in all these languges, plus many more!  I already had the first six seasons in blu-ray which were region-free and had all those voice tracks and subtitles.  I badly wanted to get a Season 7 like that, too, but could not make that determination by looking at any of the product descriptions.  The only release I found with English and German vocal tracks was at the amazon.de (GERMAN) site, but those disks are described as being only for the European PAL system, and therefore would not work here in the U. S. (?).The funny thing is that I only made this discovery by examining the accompanying ""Conquest and Rebellion"" disk that came with Season 7 as an extra feature.  There, I saw the extra foreign language vocal tracks listed.  I immediately then loaded the first disk of Season 7, saw the familiar menu pages, discovered that I could select different spoken languages, and chose German.  Then I started playing it.  Sure enough, the vocal track is in German, and, of course, with that playing, I could also select a simultaneous English subtitle at the bottom of the screen.The oddest thing is that when you look at the case, the disks, the printed inserts, etc. of the Season 7 disk set, you will not see ANY description of what languages there are on the vocal track.  So, I wanted to share this information.  It was VERY important to me.",5.0

All of these locations are new, except for the Dragonstone Map Room which was revamped for Season 7.And WHAT locations! Daenerys' beach landing below Dragonstone castle is Zumaia Beach in Spain. It's rock formations echo dragon's teeth. And the long stairway wending up from the beach to Dragonstone are real, the stair and causeway leading to the island chapel of San Juan de Gaztelugatxe.Also real is the Italica Coliseum, built by the Romans and used for the Dragon Pit. They CGI'd in the tall walls, and covered over the rectangular hole in the middle. But they used the long pit extending to the coliseum entrance as the underground ramp up which the Hound carries the crate with the wight.Highgarden Castle scenes (and what a scene between Jaime and Lady Olenna Tyrell) were filmed at Almodovar Castle, again in Spain.

6470,B074L5QBBF,R3R9AHU05JZ9J6,Packaging size difference from previous seasons.,"  I enjoyed this season well enough. Had some very exciting episodes. The writing has definitely suffered a little ever since they surpassed the novels, but this review is more about the physical product than the series. If you're like me and have been collecting the seasons on DVD, you may be sad to discover this season is packaged differently. In previous seasons (not sure about 6, hasn't arrived yet), the cases have all been the same size and thickness. This package is about half as thick, which is really going to mess with my OCD as it sits on the shelf next to the others. Included is an animated history lesson which is packaged separately, which was ENTIRELY unnecessary. They could have packed it in with the rest of season 7, and increased the size of the box to match the previous seasons. If you haven't already started purchasing these, then don't start now. Wait until the series is released as a complete set and buy that. It's more likely to match.",3.0
6471,B074L5QBBF,R1YZ0F33SRCYD1,Roaring toward a great finish to the series,"  ++++Warning, this will contain spoilers from the previous season, but no major giveaways from season 7++++I will not go into great detail about the season's storylines because it is impossible to do so without giving too much away.  But, this season (which is the second to last season) basically is setting up the two major conflicts, the battle against the army of the dead, and who will rule the 7 kingdoms if the army of the dead are defeated.  It picks up shortly after the events of last season with Daenerys finally crossing the sea and coming home, Jon having won the battle of the bastards and being proclaimed King of the North, and Cersei claiming the iron throne after getting her revenge on pretty much everyone last season.  This season sees the first skirmish between the two sides, then each side having to figure out how to deal with the white walkers.For extras, there is at least one commentary track (some episodes have a couple different commentary tracks) and in-episode guides for every episode.  Then on the last disc, there are about an hour's worth of making of and behind the scenes materials and a handful of animated shorts on the history and lore of the seven kingdoms.  There is also a separate disc with the animated Conquest & Rebellion story, which basically sets up everything that happened up to season 1 of the series, some of which may show up in live action when the spin-off show(s) are made in a few years.Overall, the show is what it is, and most people know by now what it is like.  There is still a lot of sex and violence, although the sex has probably been toned down a bit this year.  So if either of those turns you off to a show, then you still will not be into the series.  I would say that not as many main characters die this year as have in the past, but it is clearly whittling the number of characters down.  Obviously, the show is now ahead of the books, and it is not clear how the two stories will ultimately match up when the series is over and George Martin finally finishes the books.  That said, the showrunners have done a great job telling their story, and this season sets up which should be a very action-packed, and hopefully satisfying end.  It continues to be well written and acted, and the visuals, both in practical and special effects look great on blu-ray for those who do get the discs.  The only drawback this season is that the number of episodes is less than in the prior seasons (7 versus the 10 that had been the norm for the prior six seasons) although there are a couple longer episodes which offsets that a bit.  I definitely recommend it.",5.0

Okay, this is an incredibly well-made series, taken from an excellent series of books (which haven't even been written this far yet, although the storyline will NEVER match-up with the HBO series for a myriad of reasons), but I really HAVE to make a criticism regarding Episode Two (""Stormborn"") in season-seven involving the whole concept of an AMBUSH!  We all know what the word ""ambush"" means, correct?  You attack your enemy using SURPRISE, usually after your enemy has walked into a carefully set trap.  So HOW is it even possible for a large fleet of sailing vessels to ambush an enemy fleet?  HOW is it possible that NOBODY on an entire fleet of ships is aware of a large enemy fleet sneaking-up on them?  But we're expected to believe that such a things happens in the Narrrow Sea between two fleets of Ironborn ships, specifically planned that way by Euron Greyjoy, who knew for certain that his niece's fleet could be taken completely unawares?

Somewhere between the primal, the ""sophisticated"" and the supernatural, we still vicariously reach forward with equal longing in Season 7,  as in previous seasons, to find balance, harmony and happiness in the human status, to feel vindication, to find redemption, to feel victory, to find rest at last in a ""primal"" justice that won't be quashed.

6477,B074L5QBBF,R2W028ZDHFMV88,"""Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe.""","  Season 7 of Game of Thrones is what happens when George R.R. Martin doesn't finish his books. The Starks end up having these happy episodes. HBO is now past the books and is carving out fresh new storylines that may or may not coincide with what Mr. Martin has got planned. Season 7 is gratifyingly the reunion season. Show's almost at the finish line. The show runners and writers are now allowing their sprawling cast to run into each other. There's a sense of driving momentum.Some folks are butt-hurt - detractors who claim that GoT has jumped the shark, that it's strayed from the gritty reality of bad things happening to good people. I disagree. Good people still get sh-- on in Season 7. And I loved the plot progression, the sense of things finally coming to a head. Absolutely, I relished the breadth of intricate, leisurely world-building and rich character development from seasons past. But you have to pay them off at some point, yes?And maybe there's a smidge of legitimacy to those who grouse that travelers in-show seem to have obtained either supersonic ravens or ten-league boots, what with the seemingly time-compressed storytelling and the characters now not spending so much time enroute to places. But is that really what you crave? Scene upon scene upon scene of people journeying from here to there? Think of it this way, then. It's still taking people just as long as before to get to places. It's just that the show isn't bothering to linger on those scenes anymore. To reiterate, there's a sense of momentum now. Pace has accelerated. Winter Is Here. Sh-- is about to go down.One nitpick I'm down with is the one that bags on Bran whose incessant assertion of ""I'm the Three-Eyed Raven"" grates on the nerves more so than Daniel Rand's ""I'm the immortal Iron Fist."" And, yes, the Three-Eyed Raven is still Westeros' version of the Internet.Even the slow burn episodes pack it with game-changing ramifications and happenings. And, yes, be warned: the writers are weeding out longstanding side characters one by one. Not everyone wears plot armor nowadays.For those who haven't watched Season 7 yet, I won't spoil it too much. But so many cool things happen. So many neat pairings-up, with characters either reuniniting or meeting each other for the first time. I am now hoping for a Tormund Giantsbane and the Hound road movie.Momentous truths are revealed. You get rewarded with callback after callback. And there's a nod to the Dirty Dozen. And the cultivation of a strange boner I wasn't quite sure how to feel about. Some of the things that you were hoping would happen, happens. And some don't. There are epic, boss battles. I swear, the sheer amount of logistics and choreography that went into staging these combat sequences are staggering in scope - although, okay, they still fall short of the stupendous Battle of the Bastards, maybe because Miguel Sapochnik didn't direct any moment of Season 7. Also, someone invents the wheelchair in Westeros. Progress, baby!This is how you do it, Season 8 of The Walking Dead.",5.0
6478,B074L5QBBF,R25F9BMNKMJPVZ,"Good season, confusing digital redemption information","  This is a good season with some amazing set pieces and a quickened pace towards what will ultimately be the climax of the show.  The only problem is that the pace, while kind of nice, feels very out of place with the rest of the show. Sometimes, it would take almost an entire season for a group to reach their intended destination; and in this season, it would take only an episode even though it should have been a long journey.  Some things that I would have liked to have seen were only touched on because of this.  It doesn't ruin the season, as it's still very exciting, but I think the decision shorten to 7 episodes was a mistake.I'd also like to note that the digital file IS available to be redeemed on iTunes, as have been all of the other GoT seasons.  Also, the digital copy appears to redeem ALL 7 SEASONS of the show, not just season 7.  It did this both on iTunes and Vudu, but the redemption code card only made mention of season 7, not all seasons.  The seasons don't appear to have the short extra featurettes that came with the other season redemptions, and the episodes are all listed together under ""season 0"" in iTunes. So this means, having all seasons in iTunes, I have seasons 0 (from this blu ray), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  This is kind of annoying since it's organized so poorly.",5.0
6479,B074L5QBBF,R1U2F2SGMCLV4N,Awesome presentation of lackluster season,"  If you already have the previous six seasons, going for the next one is almost a given. You can expect the same quality in production, looking and sounding very good in any kind of set up. Missing is the last season recap, although I‚Äôm not sure if that is because HBO never made one.There are plenty of additional features to go around, with the most interesting being the Conquest and Rebellion set of animated shorts (it comes in separate disk, in its own box).In terms of the season, well, it holds better watching the episodes back to back, and feels a lot less rushed (especially episode 3) than watching it week by week. The show has always been very character and dialog driven, and the lack of action sequences never felt as a loss. But this season, maybe because most of the characters still alive are not that prone to having long, insightful exchanges, felt rushed in some parts, and very slow in others (the first episode is almost all a set up). And that is even when you have one of the best sequences in the whole show (end of episode 4), and an amazing fight in the north, although for very questionable reasons.Overall, Season 7 of Game of Thrones is still better than most stuff out there, and production wise is top notch. But perhaps the lack of direction from the books, or the excess of freedom from not having a reference source, is very noticeable now. Here is hope Season 8 is an improvement.",4.0

I currently have over 90 unopened DVD's/sets pending in my library.Spoiler alert, it is interesting to notice that the Targarean penchant for incest is still being (unknowingly) carried on.",3.0

6483,B074L5QBBF,R33GWV44NKT71O,great buy. As for the actual season 7 content,"  This was cheaper than just the standard Blueray for some reason, and it comes with bonus features. Anyway we've watched it in multiple languages already, great buy.As for the actual season 7 content... well this season had by far the most rewarding battle scenes, but also, by far the worst writing, dialog and plot devices. You can really feel the absence of GRRM in this season. We got teen romance, and goofy forced plot twists that will leave any reader of the books scratching his/her head. Tyrion has become a cliche of himself and the show lost a lot of its gritty realism. Still, good fights though.",5.0
6484,B074L5QBBF,RZEB3BOOJRLM2,"Great show, but not a great value...",  I love the show. But this only half a season-7 episodes. Yet it costs $10 more than any previous season with twice the episodes.

6485,B074L5QBBF,R2K66MM3G3GWYO,WE DID NOT like the last season of GOT!,"  We personally DID NOT like the last season at all.... I think here and there it's really boring, many times you feel things are hurried up without any serious climax (like the Dark Lord who is killed suddenly and in few seconds) + the characters you loved throughout the series end up being treacherous, showing such ugly unexpected angles of their character. And on top of that most of the favorite characters die and the less important ones (like the little brother) or the ones who are selfish and mean (like Sansa) end up remaining in power... Definitely, we are very disappointed....",1.0
6486,B074L5QBBF,R1SXXLR1I8WTC5,Game of Thrones,"  Can't say enough good about this movie.  All I can say is it is an awesome, cool, story line!!  I wish they would make a censored version of this movie as well though, so that my whole family could watch it.  It is definitely not for kids!  There is quite a bit of nudity in most all of the seasons. In my opinion it's right up there with Lord of the rings, only much more graphic and serious.  Kind of mixed with the reality of how things would really be, such as a good guy doesn't always win, and also with plenty of cool fantasy, and twists and turns that you don't always predict that's coming, like how it is with a lot of other movies.  Nope . . . this one is much different!  Definitely worth adding to my collection of watch again movies.",5.0

I noticed, though, that the episodes themselves seemed rather abbreviated.  Of course they are in non-George RR territory now since he'll never finish the book series.

6490,B074L5QBBF,RDKOB1GUHI9UH,Good show,"  We all like it at our house, but Season 7 was a bit disappointing overall.  We kept wondering thorughout GOT in season 7 and 8 how they could make such idiotic and stupid strategical blunders when it came to dealing with opposing armies.  The battle against the night walkers was particularly stupid on the part of the humans, especially when they sent the Dorthraki to massacre, why didn't Dani and Jon burn the nightwalkers down first then send the dorthraki to mop up?  I mean really.  Season 8 finale?  well that was really disappointing.",4.0
6491,B074L5QBBF,RMUFJU483KZN8,Really?  That was it?  We waited all that freaking time for this?  Unbelievable.,"  This is what happens when a movie or series is made from a book that is not finished.  George Martin is partly to blame here.  His books are very clear as to what is happening at any given time.  There is no ambiguity about the plot.  There are certainly lots of surprises that the readers have to adjust to but overall we know what is going on.  When this series overran the books, there was no longer a coherent path to follow and B&B were nowhere near talented enough to second guess where Martin intended to go with his storyline.  He should never have let that happen.  It was his baby and B&B had no idea how to care for it.  They were going on the momentum of the first four books and then the wind left their sails and they slowly but surely fell to earth when they didn't have Martin to guide them anymore.  It was painful to watch and maddingly disappointing to realize, episode by episode of this last season, that the train wreck we all hoped would not happen was, in fact, going to be even more spectacular than we could have imagined.  I will not buy this last season because I don't need to be reminded again of how much I resented being treated as if I could not tell the difference between good craft and worthless dreck.",1.0

I love that just when you know which main characters you love you start fighting for the scondary ones to survive. That sounds a little crazy but it's cool that you very suddenly start wanting those characters to make it. It's an excellent show and I feel like the writers and actors are amping it up to make the fans happy before it is over. For once I am actually glad I don't know how it will end.

6498,B07MPCMXGR,R6YMYD1WZMB6Z,Best Immersive Detective Experience I've Had!,"  I just got into detective style gaming at the start of the year and have been seeking a realistic experience.  I've looked into all the subscription boxes like Hunt a Killer, but having seen videos, while they are made very well, they are more puzzle solving in the escape room sense than actually feeling like solving a crime.The Detective board game is a great game in itself but I found this one to be much more immersive and realistic.  The quality of the components are the best I've seen and the presentation makes you feel like you've been handed an actual case file (minus the gore) from a police department.  Newspaper articles feel like they are from a newspaper, photos are actual real photo quality, reports appear as if they could be legitimate documents.Everything you need to solve the case is included, which to me is better than having to spread it out over 5 to 6 months compared to subscription boxes which can add up in costs pretty quickly.  I think the costs of these are a pretty good deal for the contents and the experience.It took me about a week to solve, sitting for a few hours each day to revisit things to see what I missed.  Overall I think they did a great job with making it difficult in the sense that you feel like everyone could be the killer.  The moment I discovered something felt great and made me want to dig in even more to keep that feeling going.  I love that they have the sealed content with it so that just when you think you've seen everything, they give you a bit more.  It makes it feel like your persistence has paid off.Ok, so now for the negatives.  After combing through everything like a good detective, I discovered a number of typos and inconsistencies.  While for the most part none of these are game breaking, one could throw off your logic and mislead you, however I still was able to solve the objective relating to it.  The other downside is the amount of detective work that I put into it, such as creating a time table of every event that occurred, where people were, how much distance between locations, how far could someone travel on foot versus in a vehicle, analyzing every statement from suspect to witnesses for accuracy and such.  I wanted it to be much more than it was and in the end a lot of that time was wasted effort as it was much more simplistic than I had thought.  I enjoyed that type of work but I wish it had much more of a pay off.Overall I would definitely recommend it as it's the best I've experienced so far.  I'm also open to suggestions from other shoppers of similar experiences.  I hope these people continue making these cases and making improvements.  I think some proof readers would help avoid the typos.  I would love to have more in depth analysis of the cases, such as the efforts that I have mentioned, pay off.  Maybe instead of the 3 objectives, have smaller clues to piece together that eventually lead to solving an objective.  I'd also love to see these go more in line with some of the subscription boxes as far as including physical items involved in the case or perhaps just more emphasis on items in general even if in photographs, like the murder weapon, items found at the scene or elsewhere.  Perhaps even an online component like in Detective where you can access the police database to corroborate suspect/witness statements like looking up phone records, vehicle registration, news articles, websites, etc.  In general just more of everything.  Even if these were deluxe cases at a premium I'd still purchase them just for the immersion.I'm not disappointed with my purchase at all and glad to have ordered the second one in advance based only on the quality of what the first had.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next!",5.0

We spent the good part of a Saturday working on this case and it was just the best time. My 8 1/2 year old was so excited, she was super helpful too! We made copies of everything so we could write and highlight on everything, and there were so many suspects and information sheets that we literally had to tape it all on the walls and group all of the info together. I can‚Äôt believe how much fun we had!!! I would order every single one of these if there were more. We really enjoyed it and it brought everyone together.

I‚Äôd recommend this game for entry level players as this game was kind of simple for me. I would probably play other games in this series in the future but do expect the case would be more complicate. I watched lots of detective tv shows and owned all 3 consulting detective board games (some of the cases were really difficult), and so I consider myself a experienced player. When I took a glance of the files after I opened the case, I immediately knew which files were noise information and which would contain useful clues. I knew who should be the killer in the first round after reading everything, although I failed to find the corresponding evidences in every round LOL. It took me a while to find the right supporting evidences, however, knowing the real killer too soon reduces the fun.",4.0

I highly recommend ordering this if you or someone you know has the same interest.I was really impressed with the quality of the documents and photos. They clearly put a lot of work into establishing this case. It took my girlfriend and I roughly an hour and a half to complete the case.The online answer key/checker had a great format as it didn‚Äôt give the answer away until you had shown what documents led you to your answer. We did run into some issues with their website when trying to check our answers for objective B but we sent a message to Unsolved Case Files on Facebook and they were quick to resolve the issue.It is clear from my interactions with Unsolved Case Files that they truly care about creating an in-depth product as well as an enjoyable investigative experience.

6506,B07MPCMXGR,R25FCMFS1PXZ3S,A fun yet pricey for what you get interactive mystery story.,"  I had fun working on this. As an interactive mystery story it works. I've play a few different styles of these mail order mysteries, and the computer interface portion of this was lacking. I've set up my own investigation station for playing these type of games and I had all the evidence scattered around it. I took pages of notes as I first read over all the information., sectioning it off in pile of pertinent data. I had a time line on my virtual murder board. It took me a good chunk of my free time before and after work on Friday, and by late Friday night I had completed the first objective and went to bed. Waking up the next morning with a renewed drive to find the true killer I dove in and had objective 2 complete in about 15 minutes. Having let myself just go with it and become part of the story( I do this with movies all the time) i was feeling feelings.Then i solved the third objective in like 5 min and only because i knew i was right, but I felt like the puzzle itself was pushing me to look elsewhere and I did. Still came back to the answer I knew was right.Over all it was a nice, fun experience, if you're into that kind of thing. $19.99 might be a better price point for what you get though.",3.0
6507,B07MPCMXGR,R1RCMFZAV1XEEM,Was fun.. until the blatant racism,"  My family and I were really excited when we first opened the game! The packaging seemed very well designed.

They literally made the only black character in the game homeless, thieving, grammatically challenged, and an alcoholic. The overtly racist theme made the game unenjoyable and super disappointing.

The kit/file comes with photos, suspect and witness statements, a map of the town, and much much more! Seemed very authentic - I felt like a real detective. My kit was missing one witness statement but I emailed their customer service and they got back to me in a matter of minutes with a PDF attachment of the missing form.

6509,B07MPCMXGR,R10TAWVGC9H8TF,Great entry level game,"  I've done both of the available Unsolved Case Files, and these are the first ones I've tried of the dozens of different kinds out there. I picked the brand really because of the price and most of the reviews were very good. I ordered the Julia Banks one first, and spent a few days off and on working through it. I needed some hints, but I absolutely loved poring over the evidence in the file and figuring out one piece of the case after another. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the Harmony Ashcroft one before I'd finished the first case. It only took me about 4 hours to finish it with no hints. It could have been because I'd done one already but I truly think it's the easier of the two.As for what you get and how it works... You get a case file filled with documents like witness statements, coroner's reports and evidence photos (nothing graphic at all), suspect reports, and newspaper articles. There's a card inside giving you the first objective, and 3 other sealed envelopes that are to be opened later as you solve each objective. The contents are very well done and are fun to go through. Every piece counts.Once you think you've met an objective you go to a specific URL address where you are asked some questions that you can only answer if you've truly figured out the right answer. You can easily go back and try again, or opt for a hint or two. It does a great job of not giving anything away, and the initial hint is subtle enough to point you in a general direction without ruining the rest of the game.Overall, a great entry level detective game for those of us who love crime shows! There's a third one that should be out soon and I'll definitely get it as well.",5.0

I spent less than an hour going through and completing the objectives. I had a great time doing it, but I wish it was harder to crack.

I solved the case in a single sitting, which was a bit disappointing. The case is not extremely difficult to solve and the bonus objectives do not add much to the gameplay (I was already chasing those leads prior to completing the first objective). I was impressed with the quality of the evidence. The photographs and newspaper clippings seem genuine, which adds to the realistic feel of being an armchair detective. My case came with a duplicate copy of one piece of evidence, but nothing was missing. Overall, I think this would be fun for a group of young adults or mature teens. I do want to make it clear that you will not finish this game ready to crack open 10 year old cases, but you will have an enjoyable afternoon escape.",3.0
6512,B07MPCMXGR,RFTB8968WXJEV,Logical Fun (can be completed solo),"  PROSFun level: This was fun and captivating in its story line and clues.Difficulty level: I completed it solo and it took me about an hour and a half. If you frequently complete logic puzzles or escape rooms, you'll know the devil is in the detail. As long as you fully read and make note of pertinent information, you will have no problem with this case. I'd say this is for beginners, meaning if you've never completed anything like this before you should be able to figure it out if not quicker than I did, definitely a few hours TOPS.Quality level: From the photos to the newspaper clippings, the materials are created well and make you feel like you're really looking over case information.CONSDifficult level: I do wish it were a bit more complicated or harder to figure out for my personal love of being ""stumped"" but it was fun nonetheless. Originally, when I saw the bonus envelopes, I thought it would be similar to some escape rooms where you can essentially, increase the level of difficulty based on what you're able to find out along the way. You can complete it without added difficulty or as you find additional clues, increase difficulty.Anyway, fun and up the alley of anyone who likes a bit of mystery!",4.0

We really had solved who the murderer was pretty quickly but took us a while to piece together which two documents proved it the most. That part was the most frustrating for us, but otherwise it was great. There are lots of distractions put in there so make sure to pay attention to small details. We can‚Äôt wait to try another one!",5.0
6514,B07MPCMXGR,R37OJO7YR2NE2K,Surprisingly good,"  This was my first time trying one of these games from ""Unsolved Case Files.""  I've been a fan of murder mysteries (including literature, film, television, and games) for a long time, and I've always liked the idea of a game that actually simulates the experience of trying to solve a mystery.  Many game designers have tried to provide that experience, with widely varying degrees of success.  I consider this one of the more successful ones.What you get when you open the package is a folder full of documents pertaining to the (fictional) murder investigation.  You're given three tasks, one at a time, to solve the mystery.  The first task (to prove one of the suspects innocent) does contain a bit of a spoiler in that the instructions specifically inform you that this suspect is innocent of the crime, but finding the proof is actually a bit of a challenge.  And that's the nice thing about this particular game.  The challenges aren't prohibitively difficult, but you definitely need to pay attention and read carefully, because the solutions are not spoon fed to you.Though you're given a reasonably-sized collection of documents to review, it won't actually take that long to read all the writings and examine all of the photos.  The time you spend playing the game, then, depends entirely upon how observant you are and how quickly you notice the key pieces of evidence that prove each of the elements you need to prove.  It might theoretically be possible to complete a game in half an hour, but I suspect most people will spend two or three hours working through the documents before they figure everything out.While this came can be played solo, it's also perhaps the perfect party game, because it allows (and even facilitates) discussion while everyone examines different pieces of evidence and tries to reason through the case.Highly recommended.  I'll definitely be trying another one of this company's mysteries in the future.",5.0
6515,B07MPCMXGR,R3EAV1VQAELSUF,You'll feel like a detective!,"  I LOVE this game! I have played a lot of other brands - Hunt a Killer, Murder Mystery in a Box, Dispatch by Breakout, Sleuth Kings and the Deadbolt Society and this one is a top favorite! First of all, and for some people this will be a negative but for me it's a positive...there are NO ciphers or puzzles! I am SO bad at ciphers and every single murder mystery experience game seems to include them. It takes me out of the game because in real murder investigations you are not going to be deciphering morse code or something like that, you will just have to rely on the documents and evidence in front of you. This is great because it's packed full of documents and it has an easy to follow format. You complete the first objective, go online to click the two pieces of evidence you used to reach the objective, and then if you're right you open the next envelope and repeat (there are three, plus a bonus one). There are also hints if you need them. Some murder mystery boxes offer NO clues which is really frustrating because sometimes you just get stuck but don't want the entire answer to the game. It's also high quality - nice looking documents, lots of photos (yes they look like stock photos, but it's fine), and plenty of red herrings and twists and turns.The only negative thing is there are quite a few typos and grammatical errors. I guess you could technically blame the ""transcribers"" doing the cases in-game, but that's a little weak. Also, the witness statements - the witnesses speak in a very formal way, not in a way that normal people talk, which is a little jarring. (""I witnessed the butler enter the premises at 8:40pm and that's when the incident occurred."" no one talks like that!) but it's overall a very good game and there was a lot of thought put into it. My recommendation is to TAKE YOUR TIME, there is no rush. Read and re-read and look at everything carefully. I played by myself but you could play with as many people as you want! I would say this is very family friendly...there is no cursing or graphic images or anything. I would like to play the rest of the cases and highly recommend!",5.0

I wish it was like Clue, where each time could point to a different killer. Also, it is a LOT of reading.

When I received this, it was clearly opened. That really did not bother me so we stated to try to ""solve the crime."" However, there seemed to be missing documents and one was ripped. With all that said, I would still recommend buying this. I have done a few of these from different manufacturers and this company has by far been the best one. I look forward to them putting out more unsolved files.",2.0

I know the directions state to complete objective 1 first, but we didn't know that we shouldn't look at the other evidence. When we played, we unknowingly completed part of objective 2 in advance simply by observing some of the details in the photos. It was still a fun activity!",4.0
6519,B07MPCMXGR,RGIN0APPZFET3,"Great gift for crime solving lovers, albeit one or two small things","  I gifted this to my mother for Mother's Day, and she LOVED the idea, and loved the game. She's obsessed with murder mysteries and crime TV shows and she was so excited when she opened the package! It's a great idea, and the pieces of evidence are pretty detailed. It took us like 3 hours but that was mostly because we had to read through all the suspect files. If you actually figure out the clues or don't bother reading through every file, it's pretty easy to solve.That was my only qualm with the game itself. The first clue is exciting, but once you figure out the second clue, the third clue/who committed the crime is pretty obvious. I feel like they should have mixed it up a bit after the second clue and throw you on a loop. We were able to know within 5 seconds of figuring out the 2nd clue who the murderer was, even though there was a whole other envelope to open. Just wasn't as exciting. If you are a hardcore logical person like my mother is, the case is not that challenging.Only 1-2 spelling errors that I found -- one of them pretty significant [e.g. one of the articles said ""May 8th 1998, the day before the crime"" but the crime was indicated in all other pieces of evidence to have occurred on the night of May 8th. Little things like that didn't really affect the game though!",4.0

There were a few grammatical errors throughout the whole thing, but I have to say, it felt very realistic. I give this only 4 stars because I wish it were just a little more difficult. We figured the first objective out in 4 minutes. The 2nd objective I thought I had, went online to check, and I was right about the objective, but for the wrong reasons and it still considered my responses correct. I still thoroughly enjoyed myself and cannot wait until they release the other later this year!",4.0

Fair warning...don't attempt to do this after a long day at work. Lol. Two of our detectives passed out before getting through round one. We reconvened the next day, and we were able to finish it out. It took us about 4 hours total (with some interruptions from the kids coming in and out). Definitely a great game for those who like cold case files. It makes you think. Very well put together, and they are careful to not give away too much information. I would say a beginner could do it, but it would take them longer. I wish the price point was closer to $20 so we could buy them all at once, but we will space it out to one per quarter. Definitely would recommend to others. I like that this is different than other games we had ever tried out before.",5.0
6523,B07MPCMXGR,R3O0M8Z321YDFZ,Great fun!,"  Lots of fun! We had family in for the holidays and sat at the dinner table to play this. It is very well done and challenging. We did have to use the clues on line but we were on the right track. We are definitely going to do this again. Since we know now to look at everything single thing that is sent and don‚Äôt assume anything, we figure we will do a bit better without having to use all the clues for the next one we buy. Took us about 3 hours. There were 6 of us. Well worth the money for a fun night. We all love board games in our family so I thought this might be a change of pace. It was great and everyone loved it.",5.0
6524,B07MPCMXGR,RNF4W5JLWFWB8,So much fun!,"  Wow, this was a blast.  As we are all stuck at home right now my family and I each bought this and video chatted each other to solve it.  It was such a fun way for us to still all do something together and escape the boredom for a few hours of the stay at home order.  Even members of the family who weren't interested in it originally joined in an enjoyed it.  It was fun having people throw out ideas and compare observations.  We had five of us working on it and it took us about 3.5 hours but I think it could have lasted longer easily had we not had people with experience.  We can't wait to order another one and do it again.  It was a great way to get everyone engaged and talking about something other than Covid 19, health, boredom, and the chaos of the world.  $30 well spent.  The amount of time and effort that went into designing this is incredible.  Worth every penny.",5.0
6525,B07MPCMXGR,R11CJM5YCIMTIN,Good Date Night Mystery,"  My gf and I have been looking for a fun mystery box kind of thing but most subscriptions took many months before you get to solve the mystery. We tried this one since you can solve your crime with the information provided to you. You could probably solve this in a few hours, but it took us 2 tries over 2 days to solve it since we overlooked an important piece during our first shot at it. We spent so much time combing through the files that once we figured out the first part, we solved the whole case. It was entertaining, a little challenging but not difficult. The case was well put together. We will definitely get another mystery to solve from this place.",5.0

It's a great game, beautifully designed and illustrated (and I'm not a particular fan of cats) and with a delightfully whimsical feel.It's just 'thinky' enough without coming remotely close to making your ears bleed from mental cogitation, and there's a real satisfaction in getting these contortionist cats to fit in the best way possible onto your (again, beautiful to look at and high quality) boat.Couldn't be happier.  This has become our No.1 'go to', 'can we play please', 'just one more before bed' game.

I am a more casual player just in it for the fun family time. There are a range of strategies that can be used in this game, from very complicated to extremely basic, and you can win with either, depending on how the element of chance goes (such as which cards you end up with). It's fun for our whole family despite our very different gaming styles and levels. The game is of high quality with great illustrations and is well-made. It took me a couple of times through to really get a good handle on the various aspects of the game, which for me is actually very good. It offered me a challenge while still being motivating to play repeatedly. I have zero experience with any of these types of games...Settlers of Cataan, etc (S of C is the only example I even know the name of), but I found myself really drawn in by this game. We all love cats, so that's a plus, but you wouldn't have to be a cat lover to enjoy this game.",5.0

I have to say this is the most emersive game of them all.  You are really thinking like a detective. Its not like any game I have experienced. It's like living a detective novel.  I enjoy having access to the realistic On line data base. And  referencing the actual Internet web sites that help understand the Historical aspects of the crimes.. If you like the TV and movie crime shows you will love this game. You are not just winning or loosing the game you are graded on how you performed in the different aspects of the game. I hope there will be more extensions on the market soon!",5.0
6602,B079THKB17,R1WOZ9PFLAD24Y,Great game - definitely lives up to the hype!,"  It was a great game and as many of the reviews say...you definitely feel like a true detective.  I like the limitation that the game imposes where the goal isn't to perfectly get all the information so that you know 100% of the deduction, but rather need to make compromises and intelligent choices to get the best information you can in the limited time you're given.One thing to note is that you definitely should be in the mindset to play this game.  This is not a 'casual' game in the sense that you do need to be pretty focused on the task at hand and pay attention to details.  We played as a 2 person campaign, and while I would consider 3, additional players might extend the play too much for me (there's lot of room for discussion and negotiation on what to do next between players).Another note - taking excellent notes (they recommend a mind map style) is imperative to give yourself the best chance at success.  Also, keeping a log of open leads (we used excel) is important as the game can branch very quickly and you might lose track of other leads you might want to pursue once you head far down one path.But with the right group of players, there's really no experience quite like this that I've seen.  I'm excited to see if any expansions come out, leveraging the basic mechanics.",5.0
6603,B079THKB17,R3BTIEB5BP13VU,Now I have 2 jobs,"  We joke that this game is more like a 2nd job, because of the level of concentration and note taking involved. It's totally engrossing and addictive, but I'm not sure I'd call it ""fun"". The level of detail and realism are amazing! So far, each of the first 2 cases has taken us about 6 hours to get through, which is great ROI, but hard to set aside that kind of time, and you do lose a little steam when you have to pick it up half finished the next day - better to do a whole case at 1 go, but you need a whole Saturday.When we finish our final report and the Chief grills us about our findings, there's a great feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction, followed by an overwhelming need for a nap.",5.0
6604,B079THKB17,R3QBHCA9YQRE94,The best detective simulator!,"  The only thing I want to say, it is the best detective game we have ever met! It's absolutely immersive as promised. We spend 6-10 hours per scenario with donuts, coffee, tea, and the dog. It was the incredible story with twists and funny moments. We enjoyed every second of being detectives! Drawing a mind map, gathering clues, and matching suspects and their motives are incredible!We wonder there will be another story with the same mechanic!",5.0
6605,B079THKB17,R1Y2VWMULAINQV,"Solid Concept, desperately needed an Editor.","  Brevity is the soul of wit.  But so many today have abandoned the bard's famous axiom.  Przemyslaw Rymer and Lakub Tapot (the credited writers) needed someone to disabuse them of the notion that they are the next Nick Pizzolatto.  I understand that fluff was required to mask the plot points from the red herrings.  But when following the first three lead cards  in our initial gaming session I had already spent multiple paragraphs reading about the quality of the precinct's coffee and my choice of egg salad sandwich for lunch, I honestly began to lose interest in the game's narrative.  An editor needed to take a chainsaw to the script for this game.Even while gaming with a group that included several dedicated roll players ( who are more than familiar with painting pictures with words and narrative flourishes ) our patience quickly began to wear thin.  Its a shame.  The concept is solid and the idea of having to carefully select which leads to ignore and which leads to follow is enjoyable.  But, in the end, this is a game first and not a pot-boiler novel.  Some one really should have reminded the creators of this fact during play-testing.",3.0
6606,B079THKB17,R75RVDTB54YWN,Buy this game if you want an experience.,"  I've only played the first case but it's so much fun especially if you like detective movies. This game really makes you feel like your Poirot or Holmes etc etc and yes you can only play it once. If your on the fence because of the one off thing don't be it will be the best 32 bucks you spend on a game. Think of it this way you could play exploding kittens 1000 times over many years and it would be lots of fun but you wouldn't remeber a single game or you could buy this game and have 5 of the most unforgettable and greatest gaming experences of your life. You will find yourselfpouring over documents, drawing mindmaps, taking notes and going over it the next day working out a plausible theroy and deciding on what leads to follow. It will become so real you will find yourself checking behind you for deceptivly shadowy figures lurking in the background wondering if you will be next. It will become so immersive that you will feel like a real detective. I'd say that's pretty good for 30 bucks. In short if you love detective work than this game is for you it will give you an unforgettable experence buy it you won't regret it. Also when your done with it you should give it to someone else so they can experence it too it's that good.",5.0
6607,B079THKB17,RUARRFIU84TB9,Fun game filled with unique mechanics,"  We purchased this after playing Chronicles of Crime and having so much fun with that series.  This game is just as fun, if not more so.  The unique mechanics of this game include a database feature that you fill out as you progress through the game which gives you bios, fingerprint/evidence matching, and a few other fun tricks that make it feel more like a real detective process.  The game, like Chronicles of Crime, has a time limit element to help build tension.  One of my favorite parts of this game is how the stories are based on real life events/history, locations, people, etc.  You need to use tools outside of the game such as online maps, Wikipedia, Google, etc. to research aspects of the cases.  Highly recommend for those that enjoy a deep dive game.Pros:1. Feels more like a detective experience2. 1-6 players3. Cases have details that are based on real-life events, people, places, etc.4. English is not the first language of the writers, which can make for fun reading5. Cases vary in length and difficulty as you progress through the storyCons:1. Requires internet to play2.

6608,B079THKB17,R14G1C0JD1BOZW,Interesting game,"  The way this works is you sign on and the computer asks you questions once you run out of ""time"" (which is determined by your cards).  We have only finished the first of the 4/5 games.  We were really into the details, taking notes expecting really detailed questions, but the questions were very general.  However, if your attitude the ""journey"" is the fun part, then that's what this game is, all about the journey.  figuring out a story line, which is really cool.",4.0

We are quarantined so we bought it and played the first couple of cases and loved it so much we got our friends to buy it and we play it together over zoom. I absolutely love the challenge and how real the game is. You get clues but they also have you look up words or things on google. You actually learn a little about history while playing. It‚Äôs a well thought out game. You become immersed in the realistic story and before you know it HOURS have gone by and your still in the middle of a case. I highly recommend!!

It rolls up nicely into the included carrying back if you don't want to leave it out, but my family is having so much fun with it lately that we just leave it out. My wife and I play a quick game every time we pass it.Highly recommended!",5.0
6639,B082NLKMQ1,R5ZZAOC2TL14V,Fun game for kids and adults,"  Working from home, I was looking for some activities to keep my toddler engaged. My toddler liked it. These darts are kid friendly as they are not sharp and tapered at the end. The board consists of two target set. The board stays in place and you can easily fold and carry the board in the provided carry cover.Magnets on the dart are strong and does not fall easily.Overall, time pass for toddlers and adults as well, after all, everyone is kid by heart.",4.0
6640,B082NLKMQ1,R3SD5DEV7U1L99,Good Quality Fun to Play,"  There are some magnetic dart sets that are of cheap quality with cheap magnets and flimsy construction. This one impressed me: The board itself is a hefty weight for the roll-up material and the darts have strong magnets that stick consistently. The darts have enough weight so that they are easy to throw, but keep in mind they are not regulation weight or size. Having 2 boards, traditional pub and modern, is a plus too, as well as having a carry case for storage and travel. Very pleased with this set!",5.0
6641,B082NLKMQ1,RSXRVYB9XK80,Good dart board,"  This dart board is so easy to use, kids any age can join in despite it saying 6 years and up. It is made of soft material and has two sides and comes with 6 magnetic darts which are completely harmless. Just put it on the wall and start playing. Even my 4 year old loves it. It's fun, does not make a mess and is very brightly colored, can bring competitive spirit to the evening. Great to keep kids occupied and happy.",5.0
6642,B082NLKMQ1,R35GCMK3SKA56R,Very kid safe,"  My 3-year-old and 7-year-old have lots of fun with this set.And it's a way to trick my 7-year-old to practice her math ;)Magnets are good and strong, and the darts held together even after some mild abuse from an eager puppy.",5.0

I would much prefer them doing something than watching something. It is great because it is like a game for them but then they are being physically active.The quality was good. It worked as it was supposed to. It wasn‚Äôt too hard to set up.This is a great activity for a day when you don‚Äôt know what else to do or you want your child to burn off some energy.

6646,B016LBWYTQ,R2FGDBIHY3EGSF,Great except for the game pieces,"  The Good: It's Chutes and Ladders, and it has Spider-Man!  Awesome!  My only complaint- why are the game pieces so cheap???  You don't get a 3D game piece that looks like a little toy, what you get are some pieces of boxboard with the characters printed on them, and then you can insert them into these little clear plastic holders.  But get this- you have 8 different characters you can choose from- but only 4 holders???  The box says that you can ""switch them out"" if you want to play different characters, but who is going to do that?  I highly doubt the target audience of this game has the fine motor skills to do so themselves.  And any time you create a toy that the target age group cannot successfully play with by themselves, that is a design fail, my friends.  I mean, they've already given us the cheapest, lamest game pieces imaginable, but for them not to even spring for 4 extra pieces of plastic so we can even use all 8 of them?  That is just a whole new level of cheap, enough that I am knocking 2 entire stars off my rating.  I mean, come on, man!",3.0
6647,B016LBWYTQ,R111Y12BTM9VDT,Flimsy and confusing,"  I was very disappointed in this game. As other reviews have mentioned, the game pieces are cheap, and there are 8 flimsy cardstock characters with only 4 tiny plastic stands. Ostensibly, this is so you can mix and match the characters you want to play- but what 3 year old is going to do that?The board itself is drawn confusingly. I played it with two different 3 year olds and a 5 year old, and none of them could figure out how to move around the board.I got this on sale, but even that seems like too much now that I know how flimsy the game is. Definitely don't recommend this.",1.0
6648,B016LBWYTQ,R2S71EM7EY3OC6,Visually a better version,"  So for whatever reason that we still can't figure out, this is the only game our 5 year old has a harder time playing. We have come to the conclusion that the regular version uses colors on the board that are way to close in shade which makes it hard to distinguish each separate space. Look it up! Regular version uses shades of slightly dark green and more slightly dark green to separate each space. But this one, this uses shades that are easier to distinguish. Plus spiderman is an added bonus.",5.0
6649,B016LBWYTQ,R2WY7KI7VQS8R3,Missing pieces,"  My grandson loves this game. I bought it to give him for Christmas then decided to wait until his birthday this week. I didn't notice tho box wasn't covered in plastic. When we opened it today, the directions & some of the pieces are missing. Since he's only 4, he didn't know the difference so he had a great time. But his dad thought I had bought the game at a yard sale. I bought it ""new"" from Amazon. Very disappointed.",2.0
6650,B016LBWYTQ,R19WMYE3HECJLG,Disappointing and cumbersome,  disappointing! Got it for my 5 year old sons birthday - my 7 year old daughter played too. Very difficult to distinguish the 100 small board spaces and heavy characters kept falling over. Even my 7 year old had difficulty manipulating the board. We all started to be anxious for it to end after 15 minutes of play. After being intrigued by super heroes drawn on board my son lost interest fast - not planning on playing anytime again soon. I would not recommend to others.,2.0
6651,B016LBWYTQ,R37BE9U7IACUVZ,Spider-Man Chutes & Ladders,"  Its Spider-Man and it is Chutes & Ladders. Is it the greatest game ever? No. But my Spider-Man obsessed four year old loves it and my two year old loves to spin the spinner and move the Spider-Man characters around and go down slides. Its Chutes & Ladders you know what you are getting. Theme is definitely better than the game, but my kids are happy so I am happy.",4.0

I found the game pieces a little underwhelming and a couple of them are actually kind of annoying to pick up and move around the board. As far as the game itself, the horse people in my family love it. It's pretty well done and there a couple of twists that monopoly doesn't have that I found amusing.  A few of those include a Trivia question which is fine until you've played the game once and then everybody that has played it knows the answer to the Trivia question and that card becomes a bit redundant.",4.0

Unlike the slider puzzles though, it's fast, exciting, and fun. You can even play it alone (although it's worlds better with an opponent). It really is a lot of fun.",5.0
6802,B01C5U4PTY,R19MMSOR3MN3O3,"Great game, just wish it was more portable in design!","  Great game, just shake the scrambler and race to replicate the color blocks in the scrambler. I play with my 4yr old and made it easier by taking 2 tiles out of her tray. Hopefully she‚Äôll be able to grow into playing the full version as time pass.But product design-wise, I wish they could have made it more portable. As a mom of a 4yr old, I‚Äôm always looking for brain teaser or puzzle games which I can bring to restaurants to keep my little one occupied as opposed to screen time. This is a great game, just not that portable, too many little tiles and it doesn‚Äôt fold up well for storage either. To stash it away, all 48 tiles need to be taken out, no bag to store them. The plastic game plate doesn‚Äôt fold up nicely. You basically take apart the game and put it back in the box hoping you don‚Äôt loose any pieces along the way. But I feel like this could easily be made into a pack-n-go game if the game board folds up holding all the colored tiles inside. Just don‚Äôt understand why the manufacturer didn‚Äôt think about that.",4.0
6803,B01C5U4PTY,R1NXZDMR4XVB21,Great concept but could be better executed,"  I bought this for my 13 year old who loves solving different rubiks cubes. You don't really need that knowledge to play this game but it is fun nonetheless. There are a couple things that could make this game better though. First, the stickers on the cubes that you shake up aren't very vibrant in color so they don't match the play tile shades.  Second, the play tiles aren't held into the track at all so when you really get going the tiles can easily be flipped up and fall out of the board while you're playing. It would be better if they had a tongue and grove type siding so that the tiles could slide without popping out, this would also help with the third issue, which is that you have to dump all the tiles out to clean up meaning you also have to separate out the tiles (so each board has the same colors and amounts) when you go to play again.",4.0

6807,B01C5U4PTY,RVSQ6QR2GVYJ6,Fun game...,"  First off - I love this game and bought 3 to give two to grandchildren this Christmas.  I think they will love it too.I got the original game as pictured, not a knock off.  The tiles are bright coloured plastic, not stickers on black HOWEVER the little blocks you shake ARE stickers on plastic and not as bright so it can be hard to differentiate blue from green and red from orange if the lighting is dim at all.  Also the black pieces are difficult to assemble properly and do not stay together very well.  I think the overall design of this game could be vastly improved without a lot of effort.  Why can't the tiles be locked into the board the way they are in every sliding tile game ever made?  And the both sides permanently hinged together and fold up to put away?  Not hard to do.  That is why I am giving this just 3 stars.",3.0
6808,B01C5U4PTY,RL4T7C4CURSSB,Cheap quality,"  As I understand the top part is supposed to be slapped down by a player when he's completed the pattern.  Unfortunately, the three board parts are very poorly engineered where they hinge together, so that it's very difficult to assemble, and once assembled, the cheap misaligned plastic hinges bind so it won't go down one way without binding, and so you have to squeeze the hinge into alignment before lowering the win cover, otherwise it will probably break.  It's a shame that the designer didn't make the hinge so all three parts could fold for storage, but you have to disassemble to store in the box.  And by the way, the storage box had a huge gash in the front.  Pity about the quality, it's probably a fun game, and could have gotten a solid review from me.",2.0
6809,B01C5U4PTY,RK26OJIMFM2FG,Buyer Beware,"  Do not buy this product. The item in the picture is not what I received (Rubix Game). Instead I got a generic game called Magic Block Game. I requested the correct Rubix game but was told it would cost too much to have me ship the original product back. So instead, they preferred I keep the product and offered to refund half of my money. I thought, ""okay, I will try this generic brand for $5"". It is horrible.  The tiles do not slide and they pop out which makes the game worthless. Do not spend your money.  It is junk and I feel ripped off.  They got $5 from me because I am an exhausted parent who is too tired to argue another round.",1.0
6810,B01C5U4PTY,R2UPVDLJDMOU6K,Tough but super fun game,"  So this is like the sliding tile puzzles I played in the early 1990s where there's one blank space and you slide the pieces around in a frame to complete a picture or put the tiles in numerical order. But in this case, you are matching a pattern of colored blocks that resembles one side of a Rubik's cube (hopefully quicker than your opponent does).My 10 year old and I played this game about 10 times the night we got it. He was actually able to beat me once, and came pretty close a few other times. It's tricky, definitely, but once you get the hang of it, it's a blast. I'm not sure if a 7 year old could play it without help. I think it would've been more fun to play against someone with a similar skill level - so if he'd played against a sibling, and I'd played against an adult. But it was very much fun for both of us anyway.",5.0
6811,B01C5U4PTY,R1M0LS3FUKLOPK,Easy to play and fast paced. Great for adults and kids to play together,"  Really like this game! Bought it for some quick family fun before trips, after homework, etc. Easy to put together. Was some wear marks on shaker cubes, but they should be ok since they are protected under dome once assembled. Player slide pieces are molded colored plastic w/ black edges (not stickers for colors) which is good. I put a little dot on one set of the pieces so it would be easier to reassemble and have equal colors on both sides after storage.Speaking of storage, you have to disassemble the game for storage after playing if you want to use the box it was packaged in, and since the slider pieces are loose inside the player tray areas they WILL fall out when the board is tilted- not a problem during actual game play though. I decided not to take the game completely apart and opted for just putting the game pieces in a ziplock for storage.After three games, (grandson and I played 'best of three' before he went outside to play), there were already wear lines on the play area trays from sliding the pieces, which may be cosmetically bad but good for easier/quicker sliding as more games are played.PROS:. Easy to play, makes play 'even' for multiple ages to play together. Frame and play area easy to assemble. Molded plastic pieces w/ really good color and texture. Great value for quality and playabilityCONS (I use the term loosely):. No 'track' system to hold sliding pieces in play area (which would also make storage easier). Having a pouch or some other storage system would have been good. No 'easy' way to sort pieces to make sure there's even numbers/colors on both sides (easy fix though)",4.0

Amazing!The only downside is the storage. Everything is basically taken apart, or will fall apart in the box. I took snack size ziplock bags to divide the pieces that go on each side of the board, that way we don‚Äôt have to count 4x of each color every time.However, there is a game where you can mix the colors.Storage issues is not that big of a deal, definitely not taking a star off for that and it takes seconds to set up.Bottom line; WE LOVE IT!",5.0

They were meant to be SQUARES, but some were ever so slightly wider than others making them buckle & pop out when you tried to play.  The difference was not visible unless carefully measured or compared with a good one. If EVERY square was not placed the correct way you had to stop playing, try to figure out which one(s) was the culprit & start over....not good in a racing game.

6817,B01C5U4PTY,R2E94TCH86AXYJ,No way to store the game,  Fun game but HORRIBLE and cheap design.

Also, there is no real way to store this game except on a dedicated shelf because there is nothing that keeps the pieces in when you're not using it since they do come up so easily.

6827,B07M5BMVS3,R178L1KW7L5CLM,Sigh...,"  We really wanted to like this game; however, it seems as if the creators just shoved the Scooby characters into a Clue game without any real thought or planning.  While the directions are basic, the premise simply does not sense.  You are trying to find which character was abducted by a monster, but one of you is playing as the character who was abducted.  What?  I know it might sound trivial, but this game just feels like a sad cash grab, and this comes from a huge Scooby fan.  I doubt we will play it again.
